34018,Bruise anxiety I have a bruise appear on my outer thigh. About an inch wide.
3 days ago when I noticed it it was actual 2 bruises a smaller and larger bruise.The next day the smaller bruise was nearly gone. The larger looked like it was fading. Last night the large bruise was a red circle which was not what it looked like the night before which got my anxiety up.Today it's spread a bit and now a dark red turning purple ish and I noticed I have a lot of spider viens in that area. I'm so scared it's a blood clot or something worse. Should I wait and monitor it or go to doctor? I've been working with my therapist that one symptom doesn't make it true but I'm really freaking out. Is this normal for a Bruise? I've never paid a bruise attention before so I don't know what's typical. ,Anxiety
34232,Fear its not bronchitis. 28 white male
61 275lbsPack a day smoker for 10 yearsNo chronic health conditions or regular medsCurrent meds 20mg prednisone 3x a day for 5 days albuterol inhaler as needed up until last night Id been using it every 4 hours regardlessOn Wednesday 5 days ago I went to urgent care because Id been feeling some chest discomfort. My son has recently gotten over walking pneumonia so I wanted to get it checked out and start treatment early if thats what I had. They did a chest xray took blood did a peak flow test where I scored a 300. Doc gave me a breathing treatment and bumped the peak flow score to 450. Doc said Im gonna call it bronchitis and prescribed me the meds listed above.In the beginning I didnt feel sick I wasnt rundown or tired no fever no loss of appetite or anything. Ever since I went to the doctor Ive felt weird. I wake up feeling shaky I get dizzy throughout the day for the first few days my lower legs were killing me I get these random waves of feeling hotflushed and I wake up several times throughout the night either cold or burning up still no fever no chills. I feel like the prednisone should be giving me some improvement but the cough is becoming more frequent and more productive white sputum. Last night it took me forever to fall asleep because the center of my chest hurt. Ive slowed down on my smoking since going to the doctor but havent totally stopped. Im just so afraid that this is something more serious. Would something like cancer have shown up on my chest Xray or blood work? Ive been up for the past 2 hours with my mind racing. Right now Im sitting on the couch and every time I inhale I get a dull pain in my chest. I just want to be okay.,Anxiety
34276,Rabies Anxiety Long Term Incubation I'm not sure how many of you are familiar with rabies as the subject of your health anxiety but one of the worrisome things about it is that there have been documented cases where the incubation period after exposure to the virus has been years and years as high as 25 years in one case although the evidence for it is not definite. A few other examples of long incubation periods include 4 6 years and around 15. My fear here is that despite not having rabies yet I am incubating this terrifying virus and will ultimately die from encephalitis and insanity which is the outcome of all rabies diagnoses.
11 years and 8 months ago I handled two baby raccoons over a period of days my aunt found in her yard after her dog killed the mother. We kept them for probably 3 days and I would imagine my aunt had them for 2 or 3 days as well before we gave them to a local animal hospital which gave them to a local wildlife rehabilitation center before release. After dropping them off with the clinic we never heard anything else from them. My father confirmed with me yesterday that he left his contact information. I called them yesterday and they don't have documentation about it that far back but the woman on the phone was not exactly reassuring because apparently a local unlicensed person was doing the rehabilitation back then. Still it's someone who would have had the animals in their care for a period of time that would have seen anything to indicate rabies.I don't recall the animals behaving strangely but that doesn't say much. I also don't recall being scratched to show blood maybe some whitemarking from their little claws but no deep contact and if they did get saliva on me I don't imagine it was on an open wound. My aunt father two neighborhood friends have not gotten rabies. We never heard anything back from the animal hospital. The only report of raccoon rabies is from 2003 before this happened in 2006. In that county in 2006 there was only one documented case of raccoon rabies in the wild not humans. For the length of time we had the animals we would have seen some sort of odd behavior. And it's been almost 12 years. What are the chances I'm a case study for long term rabies incubation?,Anxiety
34375,Scared of dying from the flu I just started working at Walgreens 3 days ago. Ive successfully avoided the public since the flu epidemic for the last few months so jumping into a job where sick people come in all day nonstop has sent me to a whirlwind of anxiety. Last night my throat started itching and hurting but I just said it was from talking so much at my new job.
24 hours later here I am with a cough sore throat and a fever of 100.2I know its not strep because my tonsils are fine. Im sure its the flu Im delirious and having panic attacks because of feeling bad and being scared that Im going to die. I dont like taking medicine whatsoever and especially not cold and flu medicine because of how loopy it makes me feel. Im so scared ,Anxiety
34448,Long time HA resurfacing lymph nodes help appreciated Hi. I am a 19 yo male and I have suffered from health anxiety for almost 7 years now. It has been better recently since i went to therapy and started to excercise more. About two months ago my parents got divorced and recenty things haven't been too good within the family. I noticed slight pain in my stomach about three weeks ago and haven't got rid of this creeping feeling of anxiety since. So today at work I go normally to the restroom and strech my groin since ot was feeling a bit stiff. While feeling the groin with my hand I notice a bump and freak out completely. It's about 2cm long and quite narrow. My first thought is obviously lymphoma. I mean how could it not be... I haven't been sick since the first week of January so it can't have swollen on it's own right?? Then I connect the weird feelings in my stomach during the last three weeks to the bump and the anxiety is back all guns blazing.How do I move on from here?Tldrsummary
185cm tall and 65kg skinny. Noticed a new bump in my left groin it does not hurt but is quite hard and about 2cm long and narrow. I have previously noticed two other lymph nodes one in each groin and they feel similar but slightly larger. The only reason why I think its a swollen lymph node is because I haven't noticed it earlier I dont check my groins very often.Edit. I think its important to note that I started a new job in a warehouse two weeks ago. I lift boxes stand and walk the whole day so my muscles are very tense all the time. Could this have something to do with the bump,Anxiety

2 weeks ago I was in and out of the hospital for some strep throat complications which has completely peaked my anxiety. Im only 19 and Im indoors most of the time and have no family history of Melanoma but I cant help but freak out. Theyre very tiny one is small and brown but the other may not even be a mole? Its the same size but red and not raised. No pain or itching. Its just making me paranoid.

34550,Phobia of appendicitis anxiety whenever I get any tingling sensation in my stomach i'm in a vicious circle Hello i've been feeling pretty weird for about 15 days now and I want to share a bit of backstory to help you understand better
6 or 7 years ago I felt a huge discomfort around my abdominal belt so much that almost had to sleep standing up because it was the most confortable position for me I went to a doctor and he shoved his hand in my lower stomach so hard I screamed in pain he said it was appendicitis even though the pain was coming from him and him only and he rushed me to the hospital. After a day of stress they announce me that i'm fine and that I just have to take some medication because there was a problem with my nose for some reason.Because of that experience any small tingling sensation in my stomach puts me in a state of anxiety my heart rushed i feel heat around my head I want to throw up and I have diarrhea which are common symptoms for appendicitis so i end up in a vicious circle.I've been suffering from anxiety and depression for a while now and i'm pretty inactive at the moment I'm a lot on my computer but ever since too weeks i've been feeling stomach discomfort for sitting too long which triggered my anxiety through the roof and messed up my digestive system going from constipation to diarrhea every few days I also suffer from lower back pain. After a night of drinking yesterday I'm now left with anxiety and hangover and an annoying discomfort in my right flank area parallel to my arm under my ribs which doesn't help my anxiety.I have an appointement Tuesday but i'm terrified because i have to wait two days and I can't really take it anymore I'm afraid i might have something serious and I don't know what to do.

34567,Throat nastiness for months! Honestly just need a little reassurance that nothing is wrong. I'm a 22 year old male and I've had hard swollen lymph nodes in my neck especially my right side drainage and nasty looking tonsils for 2 months. I've also had a feeling of tightness in my throat. I've been on allergy medication but it hasn't really helped.
2 blood tests have shown that I have low white blood cell count and I have had a round of antibiotics but it didn't help. I've seen 2 nurse practitioners and the only thing they could offer is that I do an STI test which came back all clear. I'm going to see my PCP soon but as a college student 5 hours away from home it makes me a bit anxious that something could be seriously wrong and I'm so far away from decent help or at least help that my insurance covers. Plus I've already missed at least 3 days of school for visits and whatnot. Just a sinus infection that is lasting for months? Some other virus? Some STI the test didn't check for? Something worse? I have no idea. If anybody is interested in seeing a picture of my throat it's in another post in my post history. ,Anxiety
34616,Pressure on head likely due to stress and anxiety but knowing this doesn't make it go away. Hey everybody
20 yo Male here.To give a little rundown for the past year or so whenever I have any sort of problem with my body I tend to assume the worst and can't stop thinking about the issue until I get 100 confirmed of the problem and that it is solvable. A good representation of this was in December I thought I was having heart palpitations and it really stressed me out. Long story short and a few doctors visits later I had an ultrasound of my heart and I passed with flying colors where there were no signs of any problem with my heart. After that day my heart did not flutter once and hasn't really since because if I ever start to get to that point I remember the ultrasound and how good it was and the problem will cease. More recently however my lower right abdominal was hurting and after some googling which I know is bad for me but I still do anyway I believed it could be appendicitis. So I did my classic worrying and got some bloodwork done and a CT scan and there was classically no issue to worry about. A few days later with some medication the gut problems went away but then I had my first nosebleed in a few years. I live in upstate New York so this should not be an uncommon thing but it spiraled into something very aggravating.This is where we address my current issue which is a pressure on my head that is likely some sort of tension headache. The pain level in my head is extremely low probably around a 1 but I can tell all the muscles in my neckshoulders are now tense. I have been doing my classic Googling and I'm certain that all these symptoms I have been getting are solely due to anxiety and stress but knowing that isn't taking away any of the tension in my head. This problem has caused me to have trouble falling asleep making me wake up in the middle of the night and waking up much earlier than I would want to. Last night it felt as though I just laid there and didn't sleep at all but I'm sure I likely did. I am now on a more or less sleep schedule of trying to go to bed around 1 am not being able to until 230 am then rising for morning at about 730 am. This whole process is likely what is causing my stress but is also something that is tough to conquer due to my stress. I have started to work out recently and usually after hitting the gym I am feeling normal for a little while but right when I wake up my symptoms manifest and it's back to this anxious version of myself.I am not sure what I am hoping to come of writing this maybe I just want someone to tell me that what is happening is solely due to my stressanxiety so I can affirm that even further. Or maybe I want somebody to reciprocate with me and tell me they went through the same thing and let me know how they got through it. Right now it just seems like a constant cycle that is very tough to break but I'm hopeful for the future.Hope everyone has a great day and thanks for any help.,Anxiety
34629,AnxietyAntsy 2 weeks PostOp SeptoplastyTurbinate Reduction Need Support Hi all! First time poser here. I am a healthy 28 yo Male who recently just had a SeptoplastyTurbinate reduction 15 days ago. I am a very active guy and usually very chill and outgoing. For those of you who don't know what that is it's for a deviated septum and you have splints up your nose for a week with a ton of congestion and basically can't do anything while recovering but sit at home I live by myself with family close by. Due to the surgery I was instructed to not be super active for 23 weeks I am a runner and take boxing classes. So far my nose and breathing feels fine and is healing normally but the past few days I have been experiencing super anxietyrestlessnessantsy behavior that I have never experienced before in my life. Let me explain a bit.
8 days ago I got the splints removed from my nose and had a minor complication the day after where my nose bled for 56 hours and I went to the ER and they packed it with the most painful rhino rocket thing up my nose that was the most pain I have experienced in my life. I immediately saw my ENT 6 hours later and she took it out and was pissed they didn't contact her it was 3am. She said everything looks fine and is healing correctly and gave me the number to call if anything like that happens so she can be contacted.I got relief that day and was able to take a napsleep but the next day I got a migraine I tried to wait out that kept me up all night but ended up taking my imitrex to relieve it. A few days later I got oral thrush didn't know until the end of the day on Sunday when my Uncle told me what it was an not super serious with a swollen uvula where I felt as if there was something stuck in my throat and driving me crazy.On Sunday I think everything just hit me at once not being able to workout being cooped up in my house the whole trauma of the bloody nose incident the swollen uvula driving me nuts and not healing as fast as I wanted to living alone with my dog etc. I started pacing and my mind was racing to the point where I was like do I need to go to the ER for anxiety or do I need to call my doctor? I have no history of anxietydepression and have never felt this way before. I am not even close to suicidal thoughts or any selfharm. I was able to sit with my Dad and talk for a few hours while watching the Red Sox then have Sunday dinner at my grandma's with my whole family and that helped a lot and by the end of SundayMonday I was feeling better though the oral thrush is still annoying.Today I had some restlessnessanxiety at work that started resurfacing again like on Sunday but talked to a coworker who used to struggle big time with it for a bit. Is this normal after surgery? Any thoughtsrecommendationswords of encouragement?,Anxiety

34788,I've been making a fool of myself for the past month This is going to be long sorry. I just really wanted to let this all out and I figured this is the best place to do it.I've always had a little bit of health anxiety but it typically subsided very quickly. It was never something that had an effect on my life until recently.One night in early December I was playing a video game for several hours and barely moved. Eventually I had a pain shooting up my left leg and it appeared to be swollen. My mom suggested I pinched a nerve but I just knew it was a blood clot. My symptoms were a mild pain in my leg and swelling Google told me I was about to die and I was thoroughly convinced.A few days pass of me obsessing over this. I read about DVT for hours every single day. I'm basically an expert on it at this point. I know all about taking blood thinners and the effect it could have on your period. I was preparing myself for this life.I measured my legs to compare them many times a day. This had me believing the swelling wasn't going down. Turns out the left side of me is just fatter than the other half and I never noticed it because the difference is literally less than a cm. Was I ever swelling? No idea. My mom measured her own legs to show me a difference in the size of your legs was normal which only kind of comforted me. Briefly wondered if she too was dying and didn't know it.Somewhere around this time I thought I had sleep apnea because one night my anxiety was so bad that I was jolting awake every time I started dozing off. This fear faded pretty quickly since my obvious blood clot was my biggest priority.After those few days passed my anxiety finally won the battle and I went to the ER. Shocking news I did not have a blood clot in my leg. I thought this confirmation would make me feel better and it did for a few days. But my mild barely noticeable leg pain persisted and after all my DVT research I decided I was among the extremely rare few who had an inaccurate ultrasound reading.
6 days after the first ER visit I had an excruciating muscle spasm in my leg. Surely the blood clot has moved up into my thigh I thought. This was accompanied by my lower back feeling like it was on fire and the fiery pain radiating down into my leg. My mom once again suggested a pinched nerve. I was in hysterics at this point so I ignored her and went back to the ER.They did another ultrasound. It was negative. I had sciatica. Started googling that to make sure it could cause the symptoms I had it can. The pain was goddamn miserable but I wasn't going to die.You'd think at this point I'd be good but my mind had other plans. I developed a cough. Welp the blood clot was real and must have traveled to my lungs. I'm dealing with a pulmonary embolism now and death is imminent. I believed this for a few days before finally accepting that it was fucking ridiculous.So after about 3 weeks of this hell I finally moved on from my blood clot obsession and just focused on healing the sciatica. Had a nice 2 weeks or so of feeling like I was back to normal mentally until this week.I had a pain in my lower abdomen. Convinced myself it was a kidney infection. Didn't start off assuming a mostly harmless UTI or literally any of the many other things that could cause abdominal pain nah I went right for the hard hitter. This one could kill me it's gotta be that one. I considered appendicitis too.It was constipation.I was hopeful that my life would go back to normal after the whole blood clot disaster but now I'm worried that it was just the beginning. I knew I was being ridiculous when I diagnosed myself with a kidney infection but there was still that voice in the back of my head saying but what if.... I was still researching still getting worked up about it. I don't want to be like this. It's humiliating and exhausting.,Anxiety
34928,Anyone ever had lungchest sounds? Would really appreciate your insight. I read a lot of the posts here and I nod along and think Yeah thats me. But this is my first time posting as Im looking for some input and would be grateful for your thoughts.
2018 was a busy year for me. I got married and Im very happy aside from the crippling HA I run my own business and Im fully selfemployed. I lost 20 pounds doing a 10 week intense gym course and I got wait for it 8 colds. HA nightmare.Im a 31 year old male and healthy except for that undiagnosed illness that changes every month but is surely secretly killing me but getting the cold 8 times last year really set my HA on a spiral. Thats not the only illness I had last year. I had mouth ulcers and sore throats that I thought were somehow HIV. I had a sore on my tongue that at the time had to have been tongue cancer. I had a pain in my lower back which radiated into my testicles and down my left leg which of course had to have been testicular cancer saw the doc twice about this no meds given You all know the story all of these things cleared up and I moved onto the next killer.Anyway I went and got my bloods tested yesterday and Im awaiting results next week. I did this because I got so many colds last year and also I want to see whats slowly killing me. But my new symptom scares me. It a sound when I breathe deep. Like a bubbling or a mild rattling. Only sometimes maybe around ten breathes a day some days less some days none. I am getting over a series of colds as I mentioned. And I also have a tickley cough. Its not chesty. And sometimes I cough of clear snot with it sorry I had this exact same episode Summer 2018 with the sounds etc and it all cleared up but has returned after a winter cold and it just wont go away. Obviously Im thinking lung cancer or that Ill need a lung transplant etc I went to the doc but because the soundsensation is only there sometimes he listened and said my lungs sound Chrystal clear. I wanted a chest x ray but he said he didnt see grounds for one at that point a month agoHas anyone had any breathing sounds with anxiety? Like deep in your chest? Has anyone had stressanxiety cause extra mucus that could maybe cause such a thing?Would really love some input on this. Thanks in advance! TLDR Having sounds in my lungs every so often when taking a deep breath. Anyone have this and live to tell the tale? ,Anxiety
34953,This is ruining my life. I need to make a change. Title says it all. This is ruining my life and making me feel like life isn't even worth living. All I do is obsess and worry and browse the internet. I'm 27 F and in the past week I have gone from worrying about brain tumours to MS to early onset Parkinsons to liver cancer blood cancer Meneire's disease diabetes and other illnesses. I've been like this my whole life. I don't even know why but ever since I've been a kid I've been worried about my health. I was a semi sick child but nothing life threatening or horrible. I have been seeing a therapist off and on since I've been 14 and it does help though I haven't gone in a few weeks.
2 months ago I began getting vertigo. Doctor told me it was an inner ear problem and the whole thing made my anxiety completely spiral out of control. I haven't stopped thinking about whats wrong with me or worried about not being dizzy for longer than 15 minutes in the last 10 weeks. The room spinning vertigo is gone I'm just left with some random dizzy spells and disequilibriumunsteadiness. I was convinced the doctor missed something so they agreed to do some blood work and booked an MRI. They don't seem overly concerned but said they will do it. I'm waiting for the MRI but just got news back from my bloodwork. Apparently it's all normal expect for my B12 which is elevated cut off is 950 and I'm 1048.. This is pretty unusual since B12 is normally low if anything. I have been taking B12 supplements so I'm going to try to assume that's what caused it the nurse told me about the blood results and the doctor has yet to follow up so I don't know what to do about it besides stop taking the supplement but of course my crazy self went on Google and found out high B12 can be indicative of blood or liver cancers and is really serious. Cue freak out. I'm just done. I'm so done living like this. I don't know what the follow up will be for the B12 if anything but I'm just going to be sitting here wanting to browse the internet in hopes of making myself feel better when in reality I never will. I will sit here and think about every bodily sensation and worry about feeling off balance and worry about something sinister going on and picturing all the horrible scenarios that are going to happen and how I'm going to die young and suffer and leave my children motherless. ampx200BI just have to make a change. Even if I do have blood cancer or liver cancer my current fear there isn't anything I can do about it. It's not like worrying is going to make it go away so why do I do this to myself? I can't do another day like this searching for answers and being constantly scared. I've booked an appointment with my psychologist for this Wednesday and I am vowing to myself to get off Google and never go back on for answers. I don't know what else to do yet but I feel this is a good start. ampx200BAnyone people who have cured their health anxiety who have tips? Or just any commiseration out there is helpful too. ,Anxiety

8 months ago I had a viral infection which has since caused whatever chronic condition or disease I have.Just want to add my viral infection started with a bad stomachlower abdomen ache 12 days before the actual infection 8 months ago and I had a rapid heartrate from right at the start of the viral infection.My symptoms areJust want to start off by saying my heartrate was high right from the very start of whatever infection i got like from day 1.Tachycardia throughout the day. Little things make my heart race whereas before I was very fit I wear a fitbit and my heartrate is very normal in the 60s when I am sleeping. But in the day time when I am out even if I am just seating my heartrate is constantly around 110 BPM. And if I have anxiety it can easily go up to 140. And if I for example climb the stairs or jump around a bit my heartrate shoots up to 150 and if I go for a short jog I can't because of my heart but in 1 minute it is nearly 180 BPM. Due to how fast it beats I do not take part in any exercise. I had normal Echocardiogram and EKG.. but I did that 5 months ago. I want to point out for some reason when I am with my family at home my heartrate is also normal if I am just seating. And it was also normal when I visited my cousins and when I was in their house again just sitting.Recently I had to attend a science lab for my university and even though I was sitting my heartrate was consistently around 110125.My systolic blood pressure has been evaluated since this chronic condition.. at 130140 but my diastolic pressure has remained 80.Lately my chest feels more pressure and stress and I think its because I put alot of strain on my heart throughout the duration of this whole thing. I visited a cardiologist 5 months ago and he said my heart everything was good.For the past few days it feels if I breath in very deeply my heart hurts but not really sure where the pain is coming fromMy only blood abnormality is a very high B12 at more than double the upper limit 1476 pmolL. I have measured homocysteine just now and it was in the normal range at 9 umolL. Not really sure why my B12 is very high as I am not taking supplements and am a vegetarian.My hands for nearly 8 months have blue veins appearing on the finger. very similar to the hand in this photo but on the finger aswell httpsimgur.coman5V1XjChttpsimgur.coman5V1XjC . I had muscle twitching and tingling which happened alot throughout the day it has since gone down but the tingling and twitching still happen at times. I had a normal EMG. Leg muscles have gotten much weaker according to my wallsit time and squatting. Prior to 8 months I could easily do a wall sit for 3 minutes now after 20 seconds my legs feel unbearably sore and they are shaking like crazy right away when I start a wall sit.NORMAL TESTS AND RESULTS all this are from several months ago except the blood results posted above those are from today.

35101,My HIV Health Anxiety Nightmare I participated in a low risk activity. It is estimated the chances of acquiring HIV are about 1 in 2500. Nevertheless it has happened.
4.5 weeks later I got the flu. Cue health anxiety meltdown. I tested at 5.5 weeks. Negative. 3 other tests later. Negative. I have just ordered my final test at 12 weeks. I know its probably unnecessary but I just need to do it to be able to move on. Funnily enough this is happened before. 3 weeks after a risk where my doctor said that HIV transmission just doesnt happen this way I absolutely freaked. Cue two negative tests and 1.5 years of worry and not fully believing I was HIV negative. I know better than anyone the toll this condition can have on you. From the physical symptoms to the stress the incessant symptom googling the constant feeling of your lymph nodes or checking your tongue in the mirror or freaking at a bump on your head thats probably been there since you were born. It fucking sucks. 200 of testing later... lets hope this chapter of my life has ended. And I can start living again. Because Ive been living in my head for a while now. ,Anxiety
35117,My IUD amp HA Hi all I just wanted to put this story out there if any women are experiencing something similar.ampx200B
5 12 years ago I got a nonhormonal IUD put in Paragard. Shortly after my anxiety skyrocketed and my spiral of hospital and doctor visits revolving around my HA started. I wondered if my IUD was triggering it and I even went to my OB to get it taken out to which she scoffed at me and told me there was NO way my IUD was exacerbating my anxiety.ampx200BFF to May of last year and I get my IUD out. I go on a trip immediately afterwards and my anxiety is high still because of travel. I get back and BOOM. My anxiety is down to a 2410 verses the 6910 that it had been for almost 6 years.ampx200BI'm not saying go get your IUD ripped out but just a reminder to be your own advocate and trust the way you feel. Just because no one has had those side effects to a medicationimplant doesn't mean it's not happening.,Anxiety
35209,Onoff throbbing pain same place on head for almost 3 weeks Let me preface by saying this has been the most stressful time of my life check my post history for an idea.
2 12 weeks ago I got a dull throbbing pain on the back right of my head directly behind my right eye. It comes and goes throughout the day always in the same general area. I dont believe the pain has increased but because I am hyper aware of it Im stressing badly.My eyes seem to be sore as well maybe a bit of light sensitivity. Dont have insurance to go to a gp.... Has anyone had this happen before? Im worried of the obvious tumor or something more sinister...My shoulders and back do feel very tense.,Anxiety
35221,Heart attack scare heres what it actually was... I have GAD and Im especially plagued by health anxiety.
2 weeks ago I was spinning out chest pains shortness of breath pains in arms you get the gist. Im sure you all understand the downward spiral of HA.The weekend prior to that I went to an event and had purchased a new bra turns out it was a wee bit ill fitting and I was uncomfortable in it but didnt think much of it.Turns out ill fitting bras can mimic heart attack pains and my shoulders and arms hurt because the straps were too tight. I felt like a moron. Anyway an entire week of worrying crying you name it. My bra ended up being too tight. Wow. ,Anxiety
35327,Its funny how HA works Lately we've had a small problem with rats behind one of our walls at home. We through some poison into the hole in which they climb. No biggie.So today my dog was being more friendly and excited than usual. My fiance and I spent some time playing with her since he was in such a good mood. She licked my face a ton while we were playing the dog not my fiance lol.
5 minutes after she calmed down my fiance eventually said did she catch a rat or something?. Instantly I realized that if she did she might have been poisoned by the poisoned rat and her licking could have poisoned me. I was fine until I thought of that. Suddenly I got dizzy and nauseous. HA works like that. Unless we have the idea we don't worry about our health. Our symptoms are caused from our overactive brains. But I'm sure you knew this already. Just thought I'd give more evidence of irrational behavior. ,Anxiety
35368,How do i cope ? Actually so glad i came across this sub after checking reddit for similar symptoms...
22 year old male and i go to the doctors a few times a month with a new issue my doctors laughs when he calls my name out and sees me walk down we do have a good relationship now tho i think he enjoys seeing me as it lightens his mood .Recently started TRT after symptoms of low T got really bad i just saw a urologist today about a lump in my scrotum harmless cyst apparently I saw my doctors recently about a swollen lymph node in my neck ultrasound booked for next week i started to feel better about it until my mum just saw me feeling it and said my uncle had the same thing and its leukemia! Apparently it wont effect him till his old but what the hell !Straight down the rabbit hole googling away... heart pumping i bet i have leukemia im certain i dont know what else it could be...I have NO symptoms of why it could be swollen and the worst thing is i dont really know how long its been like that for i just felt it while rubbing my neck one day about the size of a cashew..Anyone had a swollen lymph node on there right side that turned out not to be leukemia..,Anxiety
35392,I can't believe this So my health anxiety was somewhat under control I went through a full course of CBT my symptoms had persisted for so long that surely I would be dead by now 3 years if my brain tumour was real so it was clearly time to get my life back on track. Well...I've tried I caught up with old friends made some new ones actually have some hope for the future for the first time in a long time even been trying to get a girlfriend I'm 22 and have never had one. Turns out my health anxiety hates this I'm not allowed to be happy because to be happy is to be excited for the future something that's hard to do when your thoughts are once again racing with things you thought you had moved past. Why would I go out to the bar with friends if I'm dying why am I mixing up words when typing why is my leg suddenly jerking frequently why am I even feeling motivated and confident is this finally the personality changes that come with having a brain tumour. Anxiety is cruel but this is the cruelest thing it has done yet preventing my ability to be happy because what's the point I'll obviously be dead soon. And you know what set me off tonight? I sat down on the toilet and noticed a drop of liquid on the seat. Was it there before I sat down or did it leak out without me noticing? I must have urinary incontinence cause brain tumours can cause that and wow it tends to be a latestage symptom and I've had symptoms for over 3 years huh.

35484,Shortness of breath that just wont go away Age 19Male
220lbsJust for some context Ive been feeling this constantly since December and since October Id say Ive had pretty bad health anxiety after finding multiple lumps under my skin. In November I went to a dermatologist to get them all checked out and the dermatologist said they were all lipomas and nothing to worry about but health anxiety forgets about that after a week and ever since then Ive been scared of the potential of those lumps being sarcoma cancer. Im not sure if this is what is causing my shortness of breath as the shortness of breath never goes away its there 247. Yesterday I went to a walk in clinic to get examined for my shortness of breath and the doctor noticed a slight wheeze which sent me into a spiral of health anxiety as me thinking I have sarcoma I thought it mightve spread to the lungs or something. Anyways he does some tests to see the power of my exhale dont remember what its called and then gives me abeuterol and tries the text again. I got the same results but he said when he checked my breathing after the wheeze was gone. So in short is this shortness of breath from anxiety or could it be a very minor case of asthma? The doctor also got a chest Xray done and said everything looked normal.,Anxiety
45403,2017 was brutal All of my recent med changes were on 2017. Zoloft made me mixed and totally insane I got lithium poisoning akathisia from abilify suicidal from trileptal suicidal on latuda depakote didn't work out haldol wasn't right too much wellbutrin made me unstable. It's been an almost nonstop joyride.I almost hospitalized myself a few times. I've never been before so it's a big deal. I legitimately almost killed myself on 3 occasions. I dabbled in self harm. I had a very rough year. Professionally I didn't get along with my old teaching team and they turned our kids against me. Principal got involved and was on my side it was ugly. So I finished my first year of teaching and now my second year is going much better but the end of that first year was miserable.
2017 was not my friend.I saw an idea on Facebook to put a note in a jar each week that has one good thing that happened that week on each note then at the end of the year look at all of the great things that happened. I love that idea.Here's to hoping everyone has a better 2018. It can't be worse than 2017 that's for sure.,Bipolar

45830,Is it wrong to want to choose the time place and method of your demise? Watching Dad nearing the end has me thinking. I was a teenager when I decided that 38 was the age I would end it as after that I'd be too old.
38 was over a decade ago and since I had kids and a healthy body I allowed the year to pass.Now I've been caring for my father for the past four months. He is frail has a hard time walking has multiple health issues and is in constant pain. I look at him and think that's not an existence I want I've led a rich and exciting life. He's less than 20 years older than me so in him I see my near future...I had ideation for a six month period years ago but other than that I don't think about suicide. I'm not looking to end it all now but this has been my plan for 35 years. I now learn that bipolar people have 20x suicide rate vs the general population. When the time comes and my health amp quality of life start to tank I'd like to go under my own terms.Outside of crisis situations do anymany of you have similar thoughts of a longterm planned endoflife?,Bipolar

46531,Is this normal rage? Sometimes at work especially when something doesnt work right or takes too long or interrupts my thoughts I feel a rage pent up and its like I cannot stop myself from hitting something or myself or breaking the object Im holding. For example I have broken equipment at work just by smashing it against the wall and have bruised myself up in the process via punching myself hitting things. Luckily Ive never been caught but Its only a matter of time. Some coworkers have even seen me hit the wall and throw objects work before. Im usually quite jolly so they probably think Im nuts. I dont always feel particularly unstable Im usually on edge anyways but it feels like Im normal and yet I know this cannot be totally normal. Anyone else deal with this or have any advice on how to calm down before getting physical?

46696,SO in need of help We have been together with break ups for 7 years.
2 years ago we moved for a fresh start but I feel it was to get me away from friends and family as all I have is him now. He also now has little support. I am scared for my safety and though I love him I can't do this to myself no more. I want children and a house and this feels like it'll never happen. We have moved countless times from him damaging the houses or putting us in financial debt that we are then kicked out. We have been homeless from him not being able to accept help and choosing drugs. My jobs have been comprised from him going into work and abusing me having police show up or I become sick from no sleep or malnourished or crazy depressed. He is in and out of work for his family but really is just a pay cheque and he never goes to work so has no routine. Especially now days. I've had many police involvements and hospitalized from them and other times. This past year and a half has been nothing but a downward spiral and I feel I am an enabler and he does better without me because he has to stand on his own two feet when I'm not there. I feel like a mother more than a partner. Our current house is trashed inside and out. Actual mess and filth to house damage aswell.He recently got out of hospital but his mania is still very high up. He spent all our pay on material things drugs and the likes and we now have to paid rent that I'm aware of for 2 weeks. He goes out at all hours night driving around and from this his car has been in multiple crashes but won't tell me any details so we can't get insurance. It's still half drivable but suspended and I'm worried of him driving my car. I have most of my belongings in my car as he has said he will light the house in fire before being hospitalized and did try. I am extremely mentally drainage from all this and the way I am spoken to constantly. I am walking on egg shells and get no sleep as he hardly sleeps and does many OCD things to wake me up like flicking lights rummaging through draws. Half organising or cleaning at inappropriate hours of the night. Physically waking me up to harrass me when his not driving around. I know his taken his meds and the hospital and docs just won't believe me that he isn't fine and his meds currently don't work anymore. I am sorry for the mess of this post. Hard to put 7 years of a very stressful realtionships in words and currently what's happening. How do I get out? I feel I have spent majority of the years trying so hard to help and also been a bad guy and an enabler which makes it hard too. But it gets harder and harder to see a future and happiness. I am scared he will try to hurt himself or follow me if I try. Any advice I'd be so greatful for. ,Bipolar
46923,Questions for you people who are bipolar. Hey I'm actually not bipolar but my exgirlfriend is and I had some questions regarding the disorder. I hope that this is allowed on this subreddit if it isn't then I'm sorry.We dated for 2 years. Before we got together she was in a manic episode and then afterwards we got together. At this point I didn't even know that she was bipolar. She had social anxiety schizophrenia and depressions the same as me so we worked perfectly together. We would sit at home playing videogames and were just enjoying the company of the other person. Then her life changed. She finally found the motivation to get into a new class and I think this is what triggered the manic episode. She was suddenly a complete other person she spent like 1000 all she had on creative things and new hobbies. She was really outgoing which I wasn't used to at all. And then it happened. She met with another guy. Then she met a second time with him. Until then I just thought she is finally making friends but then she cancelled a date with me to go out partying with the guy and another friend of hers. That was the moment I realised something was seriously wrong. We had a talk. She didn't cheat but she also made it pretty clear that she does not want the relationship anymore. I asked her why and she couldn't even give me an answer. She tried to explain it by feeling like she is trapped in a cage. and I first thought that she meant she wants sex with other guys but no. She told me she misses the time from before the relationship her last manic episode. And yes I know that it sounds like she cheated but she didn't I know this for a fact.Even more things happened. She proposed the idea of a 1 month relationship break without cheating. I agreed. And I think that was the time where the manic episode manifested itself completely.After 1 month I texted her and her response clearly showed me that there is no spark of common sense left in her. She didn't care about anything anymore. She straight up told me that she knew 3 weeks ago already that it won't work. She told me she is currently at a restaurant with another guy and she will bring him with her later to pick up her stuff. When she arrived she had completely new clothes a new haircut tons of makeup.BUT I also knew that she did not do any of this to hurt me. It was pretty obvious that she didn't really have a clue what her actions did anymore. It was almost like a child that just wants to have fun and that doesn't even realise how his actions affect other people.
1 week later I visited her parents to get back my stuff and they just cried and told me they don't know what's wrong with her and that she is behaving really weirdly lately.So now my questions for you guys What will happen once her manic episode is over ? Will she feel regret and shame ? And what can I do to prevent that ? She tried to commit suicide multiple times in the past and I'm almost sure that once she realises what she has done that she will do it again. And the last times I was there for her but I'm scared that she is too ashamed to contact me this time. After the break up I texted her that she can contact me anytime but I'm not sure if she will do it. I mean what happens to you guys once the manic episode is over ? And especially what happens when the manic episode started like this ?,Bipolar
47016,Fucking thrilled with myself Last year I royally fucked up my life.Got my car repossessed. Lost my apartment thankfully eviction free. Still have last months rent in collections. You can guess how that haunts me now. Oh and I stopped going to school during my last semester of undergrad. I fully believed I could start a business with no job to sustain my income. Only deliveries for various on demand services. Yippee! Got accepted to finish undergrad in the fall today. Cool. But I can't escape the feeling of how much I fucked up and how I'm still struggling to get some things right. Even though I'm correctly medicated now I still keep fucking up. Still doing delivery driving with different car. Can't bring in enough to pay even the smallest of bills. I'm just trying to piece shit together one day at a time but swear I'm one snarky reminder about a bill away from blowing up.

3 weeks ago I switched to a different SSRI and I started having symptoms like anxiety panic ruminating over that experience and feeling worthless which I think were withdrawal symptoms from the old drug lexapro I noticed that these symptoms come when there is something wrong with the medication or I am going through a stressful time.I got a panic attack at work and my manager noticed and when I asked for some time off to recover they stalled and then they released an exit visa from the country and told me I would work remotely from my home country but there is no guarantee that they would keep their word. So now I am faced with the possibility of going back to my country which is going through a tough time economically and uncertainty about finding a new job. I am now back to the old drug I used to take and increased the dosage to 30mg with the Dr's supervision.

47313,No joy or motivation for almost all my life HelloI dont know whats wrong with me. Nothing in life is fun brings me joy or motivates me. All i wish is to lie in bed all day and stare at the wall.I opened this thread because lately i have more and more thoughts like whats the point of this? why do this another 60years? and after another successful ski weekend with family i just prefered to stay in bed after skiing for 10min.ampx200BIts not something that just started to happen a few weeks ago. It follows me since childhood i would say. Nothing ever motivated or brought me joy me except computer games as kid but not even games nowadays bring me joy at all. Somehow i got through all schools till university without doing anything and missing about 20 of classes. Even in university my motvation is still equal 0 and thus I am still stuck in bachelor after 6years.I write exams from time to time because i guess thats something you have to do in life but my motivation is negativ. But when Ifind a tiny bit of motivation to write an exam I usually write very good grades while not attended 1 class at uni over all these years but they dont make me happy nor motivate me for more.But its definitely not the issue with the chosen path. I tried different part time jobs like char mech hotelero? sales not retail vet or logistics. ZERO motivation for any of it. It always started fine while I kept up my mask but usually after few weeks I couldn't find motivation to stand up anymore and quit. But also here they usually were happy with me and few even called me year later to help out again during summer holiday etc.I dont find any sports enjoyable. handballunihockeyskisailingboxing... tried and tried nothing lasted over a month except gym once because I thought all my problems are because of my physical appearance. Not even this gave me any motivation even though after intensive few months I got way more attention from women people treated me better and so on. A normal human would be so happy with this change for me it was whatever lets go back to bed!ampx200BThis no motivation follows me everywhere! I had a few romances including two longer relationships which lasted 1years and 2years with very beautifulampgreat character women. BUT the same problem again NO MOTIVATION. Obviously I fucked up and they eventually left because I had no motviation to put any effort in. I have great friends since childhood. Even now almost towards 30y they still meet multiple times per month and go on holiday 13 times year since we are 18. even here NO MOTIVATION i usually join the holiday once a year but this is like enough. It is just not fun to me to hang out. No they are very good people alone for the fact they still ask me out even tho i go deep sea most of the year. I just dont want to deal with any humans i guess.Kinda same with my family. I could call them any time and the financials are covered by my father. I just dont want to be alone.what i tried so far

47488,I stopped taking my meds.. I was diagnosed 2 years ago or so. Rapid cycling Bipolar 2. Since then I have been through dozens of medications that never worked. Finally after some trial and error good old lithium seemed to do the trick. I felt better than I have IN YEARS.
2 or 3 months ago I did what apparently is a common thing with people who have this disorder and stopped taking my meds I was good! I was happy! I could take on the world!Weeeelllllll. Over the last few weeks a mixed episode that I havent noticed until last night has cause a LOT of problems in my life. Ive been emotionally cheating thats a long story that I cant get into just now. Girls i was interested in are now no longer speaking to me because they found out I stopped taking my meds. Ive been sexting and chain smoking and depressed and hateful and spiteful and I just cant handle life right now. Im in a very VERY bad place. All because I was an idiot and stopped taking my meds. I should feel lucky. It could have been way worse. But I dont know how much worse its going to get. I know I need to take my meds now I do I just need someone to tell me everything is going to be okay that Im not a bad person that I deserve love and happiness i promise Ill start taking my meds again,Depression
47771,Im barely eating For some context my abusive ex is the reason why I was in the mental hospital. Someone who I thought was my friend was talking to him and flirting with him knowing what Ive been through. The betrayal put me into yet another depression a month after my hospitalization.
2 weeks ago I weighed 132 and now I dropped down to 127. My appetite is barely there and Ill often skip out on meals because I dont have the energy to get out of bed. My dad is commenting on how little Im eating and encourages me to eat more but Im not hungry and eating seems like such a chore. My best friend sister to the friend who betrayed me will also encourage me to eat and will give me snacks. Its not an eating disorder but rather I just completely lost my appetite and when I am hungry eating seems so tiring. I dont want to be this way.,Depression

48416,Whats my cause of stress? Thinking Bout seeing the doc just to get myself checked out. Could be old age or poor lifestyle habits but i recently had a panic? stress moment that lasted for at least 5minutes until a problem was solvedBackground info only experienced 23 occurrences where i found my legs specifically shaking due to nervousness. These experiences are spread very very far apart. 1st time over 10yrs ago fairly minor was just nervous about a new environment amp people.
2nd time was last june 2022 was falling behind online class thought i couldnt get set up this program until teacher helped lol and i think this was the main cause of stress fear of being unable to catch up? Lost? also deep slow breathing didnt work here. How to manage lmaoMost recent was few days ago no leg shaking but just like the 2nd time cant really think straight brain wasnt calming down even though i was breathing normally. Again it was a school related thing had an IT issue i couldnt fix couldnt login to join lecture that was ongoing at the time. Feared missing out important content until i remembered i can watch the recording later but didnt really get rid of that unpleasant rushed feeling and anxiousness that i need to get this login resolved. Only until i got connected with the school IT helpdesk that i felt completely fine againI seldom get nervous in job interviews but what is this??? Not sure why my body reacting like this if its just fear of falling behindmissing outPretty sure theres a correlation between 2 amp 3Any insights? ,Stress

Almost got hit head on and side swiped from truck. He blares his horn . I am shaking. I manage to calm down eventually. It has been 8 hours since incident. I an still shakey. Advice please. There was nothing i dont know how to prevent this.,Stress
48821,Can't stop being anxious 18y I'll stop feeling extremely anxious all the time when I got accepted by a college 19y I'll stop feeling extremely anxious all the time when I graduate 22y I'll stop feeling extremely anxious all the time when I get a job at my field
1 month later I got a job at my field but I'm still extremely anxious feeling that It's not enough and I need to improve moreHow can I apreciate my selfgrown and stop being so demanding with myself?If I keep going that way I'll only stop being anxious when I'm dead.,Stress
49112,Feeling guilty for wanting to take sick leave So I've worked for my current employer since April 2015. I've took approx 4 days off in that period.I've received 6 separate promotionschanges to title over that period and managed various departments and big projects for the business. Throughout the pandemic I was fortunately one of those that were not adversely affected and in fact the demand increased exponentially. During the pandemic I was promoted again and risked my physical health for the sake of our business delivering on KPI's.
3 weeks ago my dog died. Last week I moved into my first mortgaged home. It just feels like so much is happening but I don't really know what to do?I've asked for a double demotion back to an operational role to relieve my workload and to allow myself time to mentally recover and hopefully over time I'll be ready to head back into a management role again however I don't think my employer are rushing in anyway to find a replacement for me. Should I be loyal to them and keep being miserable until the organisation structure can be sorted out or should I be putting myself first and taking time away for them to fix it in my absence?,Stress
49296,Whats my cause of stress? Thinking Bout seeing the doc just to get myself checked out. Could be old age or poor lifestyle habits but i recently had a panic? stress moment that lasted for at least 5minutes until a problem was solvedBackground info only experienced 23 occurrences where i found my legs specifically shaking due to nervousness. These experiences are spread very very far apart. 1st time over 10yrs ago fairly minor was just nervous about a new environment amp people.
2nd time was last june 2022 was falling behind online class thought i couldnt get set up this program until teacher helped lol and i think this was the main cause of stress fear of being unable to catch up? Lost? also deep slow breathing didnt work here. How to manage lmaoMost recent was few days ago no leg shaking but just like the 2nd time cant really think straight brain wasnt calming down even though i was breathing normally. Again it was a school related thing had an IT issue i couldnt fix couldnt login to join lecture that was ongoing at the time. Feared missing out important content until i remembered i can watch the recording later but didnt really get rid of that unpleasant rushed feeling and anxiousness that i need to get this login resolved. Only until i got connected with the school IT helpdesk that i felt completely fine againI seldom get nervous in job interviews but what is this??? Not sure why my body reacting like this if its just fear of falling behindmissing outPretty sure theres a correlation between 2 amp 3Any insights? ,Stress
49612,Can my episodes shift on exact day every 3 months? I was diagnosed bipolar 9months ago and still doubt. But after several drastic changes in my emotional state I tried to track it through app and failed to be consistent. My approximate understanding was 3 months as a harpies moments and life sucks mode.
2023 I started really bad and wasnt able to eat think and shower. I sleep a lot. But January 18 I couldnt fall asleep was excited about smt and thought its bcs of my birthday on 19th January. Nothing really happened that day but I kept waking up 4am excited to do something and everything seemed very simple. I just accepted that I am Porsche with no breaks but 18th of march I started feeling terrible. I dont use any apps or diary. Its just feelings were so strong and I couldnt ignore dates and mood swing. Its almost a week I feel anxious about nothing and I am really afraid that I am not there where I should be or I am doing smt wrong. That my family hates me. Its hard to explain but I take more than 6 valerians pill per day cuz I cant deal with ice in my stomach Any ideas what it can be?,Bipolar
49627,Does anyone get bad cabin fever? I literally can not stay inside for longer than half a day before I feel like my mind is closing on me.
20 years ago I isolatedyself in small room for two months literally driving myself nuts physically in my head. It wasn't thoughts more about feelings in different parts of brain.It use to go away as soon as I went outside but now it's been getting worse where I have to stay outside rest of day and comes on too fast. Clonazepam helps but I haven't taken it in two years.,Bipolar
49629,The most frustrating appointment So last year after an attempt I was diagnosed in hospital with bipolar disorder. I have been prescribed all the meds and have had continuous appointments with my GP to try and get everything settled and find a good prescription that fits what I need.
2 months ago after having a month long manic episode I went back to my GP in the hopes that we can really dial down into what I need. Skip forward to today and I have a phone appointment with a psych from my area we only have like 7 in my province. After asking me approximately 10 questions he determined that I dont have bipolar at all but major depressive disorder and PTSD.Would you go for a 3rd opinion at this point? I have had clear textbook manic episodes all throughout my life and this psych didnt think I met the requirements to be diagnosed with bipolar so he doesnt believe I should be treated as such and has prescribed 200mg of Zoloft. This concerns me as I know antidepressants can lead to manic episodes. I would love your advice. ,Bipolar
49671,Life has left me hopeless. First thank you for reading my rant even if you don't make it to the end...Life advice please...
30f relationship with 31m anf we have a 9mo son.We lost the home we were renting back in Dec due to mold. We've been back and forth between the inlaws since. I'm in school and he is looking for work but also is waiting for his Bar exam results.I can't stand living with other people. I'm currently dealing with my mental health Bipolar and ADHD and it's hard to function at times. The other day I was overwhelmed by my MIL who wanted us to bring the baby over to meet some family last minute. That ended with me yelling at her when she came to the car wanting to take my son out because he was crying. I told her to worry about her children not mine.This morning at 6am I woke up to find my partner in his parents room talking. When he came back he stated It's me amp you over and over. Later he explained how no one will understand me or my Bipolar and how much weight I carry and how hard it can get for me on a daily basis. He didn't go into full details of the convo because I'm an overthinker but him stating his parents asking if I'm in therapy or taking medications made it obvious. That's when my partner got upset because he saw how I consistently have to deal with our families not understanding. As I told him not many ever will.I hate living with the inlaws. I love them but I don't do well with the MIL always home. Having someone consistently there and always watching what's being done with my son being there to greet him all the time or making opinions like he's hungry he wants milk look at this look at that etc has really been getting on my nerves. To the point that now I can't stand her voice or go into a negative mood when I know she's going to be around.My partner and I both feel uncomfortable staying at each others parents. Financially we are unstable at the moment and were trying to figure out what our next move is...When my son was born the first two weeks we got covid. Then after 6 months of living alone we lose our home to mold. During Christmas I went through a perfect storm of depression with losing the house and overwhelmed by everyone wanting to meet my son. I feel like his first year was one of the hardrst for me and I want to be able to enjoy these 3 months before he turns a year but it's been so hard...SO!Any advice? Any recommendations on work from home? Any knowledge regarding starting a dropshipping business to earn an income?I need to do something because I can't keep living thi way. This is the most I've thought about suicide and that's not fair to me or my son! I'm looking for any avenue to be able to provide for my son. I miss having our own home and I miss alone time with my boys and I miss being content and feeling some happiness... HELP!,Bipolar

50307,Treatment and effects. I am going to tell you a couple things I have experience with I am telling you these because they effected me significantly and you can possibly understand your own position better by knowing this.I had 12 sessions of ECT it was devastating logistically a nightmare and it did not work.
90 of marriages with one BP persons does not make it. I was stunned by that.Knowing that about marriage has kept me single.When they put the electrodes on they had problems because tears were running down my face.God luck and God Bless You.,Bipolar

50741,Seeing some progress but feeling stuck. Hi
24yearold male with AVPD here. For some time I have noticed that contacts with other people in my case only at work began to bring me pleasure. I've also become more relaxed and when I'm around people I don't worry as much about how they react to what I say. At the same time a desire for more close relationhips arosed in me. This desire applies both to finding a partner and friends. I just want as real as never before in my life a simple conversation with another person and intimacy.However I don't know how to achieve this. I've finished my education and I don't have any social hobbies the gym can be considered as such but I still can't find a way to start naturally a conversation with other people there. I'm starting to get annoyed with this situation because certainly something has changed in my attiude and I truly want to form some relationships outside of my work environment. I think I'm ready to get out of my comfort zone step by step but I don't know how to do it.One way to do it is to start dating. Finding a partner is something that I want very strongly and I think love is something I'm capable of. The thing that's holding me back from making that move though other than well... the lack of photos to use on dating apps is knowing that I'll be too much of a burden for her not having other relationships. Perhaps there is also an element of shame in not having any friends. I am not sureHave any of you reached such a point on your journey to normality? I'm not sure if I'm overanalyzing everything and if I shouldn't just do what I feel regardless of my doubts. In my case finding friends seems to be something more distant at the moment and I don't know how I could achieve it. However I will be grateful for every piece od advice!,Personality-disorder
51075,The hollow self My life is spent largely devoted to work. Between morning prep commute actual work hours and evening prep like laundry packing lunches and other small maintenance tasks I only get about 3 hours a day to be myself. After all I need to be in bed at a decent hour or else I wont be wellrested for the next work day. Thats it. Thats my life.Meanwhile even though Im so devoted to work that I sacrifice the vast majority of my life for it Im barely earning enough money to survive. I have over 50000 in debt that is slowly growing as I struggle to make ends meet. I dont know if I can ever pay it off. I can pay off maybe 13rd of it if I really push hard and eat ramen for the next 6 months. Im turning 40 in 6 months.At what point am I supposed to go from surviving to thriving? I know most people earn the majority of their money later in life but I just dont see the light at the end of the tunnel. What is my purpose? Why am I grinding on the worlds worstever RPG system? I feel like Im on an economic treadmill that keeps speeding up every year and at some point I know I wont be able to keep up.My job itself is relatively easy Im a data analyst at a medical device manufacturer. For the most part its just pulling reports for managers and being really good at Excel and Power BI. Though I dont know if Im that good at my job. Tomorrow marks 1 year in this position and every night I feel like Im doing the bare minimum. Like Im that guy on the team that everyone else talks about behind his back. I imagine they say things like Hes so slow. Whats he even doing all day? or I better schedule this meeting because if I wait for him to do it itll never get done. They dont say these things out loud of course and maybe they dont even think them but maybe they do. Maybe Im just treading water but refusing to swim towards the shore. I think Im ok because my head is still above water but realistically if I keep doing this I will drown. I need to swim.I just feel like such a loser all the time. I dont have kids and I dont want them. Im not married but Ive been in a relationship with someone for just over 12 years. We live together. She makes a lot more than I do so she pays the mortgage and I pay everything else. Its probably not a fair arrangement for her but I just literally dont make enough to split everything 5050. She earns 40k more than I do a year. She would literally need to pay our mortgage 3x a month just to get to my wage. Then we could split the 4th one that would make it even. Even with that justification in my mind it makes me feel like a loser. Not that she makes more than me good for her! She deserves it! Just that I cant contribute equally. I feel like a mooch. We work the same hours at the same company and do roughly the same amount of work. But hers pays more. Thems the breaks I guess.Overwhelming shame. About nearly everything.Im too fat. Im too bald. Im too old.Im not smart enough. Im not rich enough. Im not funny enough.I know those are called automatic negative thoughts or ANTs and like ants they should be easy to squash. Ive read about them in cognitive behavioral therapy books. I would go to therapy but its expensive. My company pays for 3 sessions a year. The other 49 weeks you can fuck off and die I guess.Is there more to this life? Is this all Im supposed to do? Click buttons all fucking day sit on the couch and scroll on my phone while watching some insipid movie or tv show then repeat? All day every day until Im old enough to scrape by on social security? This is it huh? This is the whole fucking thing?There needs to be more because I swear sometimes it just doesnt feel worth it. Im not suicidal or anything but like what exactly is motivating me to keep going?I have hobbies and interests and I indulge in them as often as I can. I grow hot peppers and make my own hot sauces I hike in the woods and enjoy nature theres so many things to occupy my free timeif I HAD ANY but the fact is I devote 87.5 of my day to making someone else richer. So my measly 3 hours a day which are in the darkness by the way because the sun has set are not exactly prime times for gardening or hiking. I have an automatic timer that waters my plants for me because I cant even be present to tend to my own garden.Its absolutely ridiculous.When exactly am I supposed to do anything of substance of value?
3 hours in the fucking dark.Thats what I get to live off of.Most of that time is spent focusing on my increasing mound of debt.50000 would literally change my life and put me back in the green for the first time in years. Meanwhile I get to help analyze the company private jet spend. Cost us over 365000 to operate for a total of 11 days last month. We paid 75000 just in pilot fees for the month of January. I dont earn that in a year. So when I see how much money there is how much is available to toss around and just how little of it I get why would I work harder? Why would I sign up for more of this disrespect?I just dont know why. Why cant I work 4 days instead of 5? Why cant I be remote considering I have only had 1 facetoface meeting in the last month? Im wasting a ton of money on a car that I primarily use to get to work a ton of money on a special wardrobe that I only wear at workits absurd. And depressing.,Personality-disorder
51284,am i forever going to be haunted by my exfriend? tw rape sexual assaulti'm 23 and an exfriend of mine is 24. three years ago i cut off our friendship. it was the closest relationship i've ever had and i've never felt more connected to a person since. i think about him everyday.
3 years ago my sister who we'll call S accused him of raping her. but she didn't even. i had to confront her about it.according to my exfriend who we'll call F they got really really drunk one night and ended up having sex. one week or so after it happened F told me first. he said that S thought it was his imagination until he saw S had blocked him on every social media and he wasn't sure what happened. he thinks maybe she's guilty because S had a boyfriend at the time. he tells me to ask her what happened. i say maybe she thinks it was nonconsensual since you were both inebriated? he says that's possible he tells me she was asleep he was in bed with her drinking and getting high she had invited him into bed with hershe told me she felt he was a little brother and could trust him.he was drinking all night as she slept. when she woke up they were both black out drunk. he doesn't remember who kissed who first but that she initiated grinding and that something happened after that... it makes me sick thinking about it. after that night he tells me my mother messaged him saying never step foot into this house again. but OP needs you as a friend. so let's just promise to keep this between us. he wasn't sure what that meant but was afraid of the worst.context matters. S was 30 years old. F was 20. she's a decently heavy drinker by no means an alcoholic but she can hold her liquor. he's literally autistic. does it sound like an imbalance?maybe more context matters. the people who checked in on them noticed that he was decently lucid last time they were seen together while she was asleep high and drunk. passed out? blacked out? he claims he was in the process of getting drunk as she slept. even more context. my family has a shaky moral foundation. they lie to get money to get their way. they've made me do it even if i didn't want to. they don't care about anyone else except the family. but they'll even mess with family if it comes to it. my sister and mom planned to keep it from me. like i said my mom thought I needed F so much that she was willing to keep it a family secret.and i keep thinking... if F was a monster if F had such shaky grounds if F cared about power he would have played along with it.i know that monster's don't rape. people rape. but people also look out for themselves when they know they've fucked up. people are selfish. F didn't seem selfish to me. a selfaware rapist would have kept his mouth shut right?why didn't he accept my mother's conditions and kept the family secret? he told me my friendship with him was his greatest source of happiness. he would've done anything to preserve it. why didn't he? and my family knew this friend meant so much to me that they were willing to keep my sister's rape a secret for my sake? if F was a monster he would have taken the deal? but monster's don't rape. people do.F told me everything. he agreed that I should talk to S and get her side of the story. because he wasn't sure if he had raped her either. he didn't know. or was his game to play dumb?S told me that she only remembers flashes. he raped me she said after i asked. she starts crying. she says she woke up with bruised wrists. she woke up sore. she didn't look like she was lying. i don't think she was lying.and for three years i've been haunted by the idea. what if truly he didn't think he had raped her? not in the way idiot monstrous men believe that drunk women can consent. me and F took consent extremely seriously. but what if truly they were both extremely drunk and they lost control of their both their bodies and that nothing could have possibly made sense except for an ugly truth? if there were a reality where my friend was truly too drunk to rape someone and too drunk to give consent himself but somehow ended up having sex with someone equally too drunk to not give consent then what would that reality look like? because everyday i wake up and think that reality looks frighteningly close to this one.,Personality-disorder
51344,On a scale from 1 to 100 how addicted are you to your phone andor computer? edit Wow. So apparently screen addiction is tied in closely.
85100.I've been addicted to any screen I could get my hands on since I was about five.In middle school and until right now... So for about 12 years I've felt like it gives me comfort and keeps me flowing. It never really mattered to me how complex or primitive the device was I was glued to it.Now I'm starting to hate it. I don't want it to feel comfortable anymore.,Personality-disorder
51453,i was a real person and then i ruined everything went through my facebook conversations from years ago today and i got so emotional. i used to speak to so many people. and i sounded so neurotypical. a lot of the messages from these ppl were rlly sweet i started crying bc i couldnt believe there was a time when people actually loved me. im so used to people being disgusted repulsed by me. like no one ive met in the past few years has actually liked me i used to be real i had hopes dreams stories to share. i was physically attractive and moderately smart. it all went downhill when i moved abroad for college. ive always struggled socially so when i realized that i didnt have to talk to ppl to survive i isolated myself
4 years later and im a completely different person. there is nothing inside me. im empty. just a lifeless being waiting for death. i dont recognize the girl that wrote those texts. my cognitive abilities have significantly declined i used to write so well and now i cant even string a coherent sentence together. im so negative and hateful. i have zero empathy. i cannot carry a conversation anymore. im constantly disassociated from reality. i havent had friends in years. the only people i talk to are my parents and my grandma id to anything to go back in time and fix it all. that girl didnt deserve what i did to her.,Personality-disorder

51905,4 years ago I wasnt showering for months at a time depressed anxious and paranoid. At the time I was sober going on 18 19 years. I was and am on disability since 09' for schizoaffective bipolar type disorder. For the longest time especially since sobriety I've been overwhelmed with thinking. Space time behavior tornadoes...whatever. But since my life was an unmanaged train wreck I had no confidence in myself as having any quality. It seems that feeling good about yourself comes from a well managed life. My last job was as a janitor on the army base near by roughly 5 years ago. I couldnt handle the pressure. I was so dependant on others for everything I was asking if I was sweeping properly. Very bad mindset. A lady mentioned crying and it made me feel like crying. I didnt understand how that could be. It seemed like witchcraft so to speak. That was my last day at my last job. It was my 4th attempt to go back to work since my disability badge acquisition! I've been in therapy for 16 or 17 years ago I got into therapy from a mental health episode. During that visit at the crisis stabilisation unit in Virginia Fredricksburg I met a man that changed my life. He went by the name Bose Uncle. He taught me a breathing exercise. 3 in 6 out. You breath in deep for 3 seconds roughly then out for 6 seconds. Also roughly. Dont try to be specific like me and do it exactly 3 and 6. On down the road life and me under pressure and practicing my breathing because sufferage bleep blop bloop pandemic. Overwhelming unadulteraded pain in the brain from an anxiety I'd never expierenced before I saw a vision. It seemed to be the exact same thing that happened to Bill Wilson from AA. A wind blew through me. His words. My words on it are I was no longer a bound up point in time and space holding on to the memories from the stimulation from the moment. I was free from the tension that came about from the fucking utter bullshit that exists. I let it go. The moment. I stopped holding and figuring. ampx200BIt was like my being afraid got wore out. I remember specifiaclly saying to myself at the height of my pain in a ridgid bodily posture laying in my recline bullshit. I calle dbullshit on my old beliefs. That old fire and brimstone god. Intstead I chose my concept of life as my God. My ideas are good to. Changed life. About six months later I nearly died from pancreatitis. When I got home from 6 days in the hospital I shared it on facebook. I received a good number of get well soon messages as expected. I did not get what I thought I would. People coming to visit bringing me food...all that. I nearly fucking died. I know hundreds of people. What does that mean? My perception is fucked up my beghhvior is fucked up I need to change. I did not think that way at first. At first I thought I fucking hate everyone. For a while. Then 6 months later I got diagnosed with autism. April 24th 2021.
6 months later after learning to relax I rested on my heels for the first time in my life. This began the second chapter of my life. The taking my time portion. The I am the most impotant person in my life to me. You all come second. For ever. I no longer run to the kitchen the bathroom through the grocery store drive fast or move my limbs fast. I have even taken control of my eyes speed of movement. Did you know that your body can control your mind. If you dont control your body your body will be controlled by your environment throught the mind. You receive stimulus simply due to being a sensing being. This moves you. If you are not aware of it. Make yourself aware of this and take control of your body the way you look smell move behavior speed amplitude of voice ...total bodily control and you can eliminate a great deal of your own suffering. I havew come off my depression meds and greatfully have finally been more aptly medicated with litium. Now I dont have to force myself into slow mo behavior but I do stay aware I think from a bit of fear. You can control your thinking! You can control your thinking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ampx200BI wish I could impress upon whomever needs it that the pause in conversation is ok. Moving the body oddly slow is not odd. Not speaking is an answer. And you dont owe a motherfucker a goddamn thing if it stresses you out. Peace in east!,Anxiety
52047,I'm an adult who can not sleep alone. So I'm 32f and since I was a kid I've struggled with anxiety and sleeping. Afraid of the dark night terrors sleep paralysis all that fun stuff.My partner is going away for 2 nights for a work thing. This means I'll be alone in the house. I have never been alone in a house I've always had house mates or family in the house with me. Any time I was left with a house to myself I would get mates to come over and stay or I would go out. Its only at night when I have to go to bed in the house that I have the issue I otherwise tend to enjoy being by myself. This whole thing is filling me with more and more anxiety. I know i'm building it up alot but its been one childhood fear never managed to sort out. I want to get over this I feel quite pathetic that its causing me so much panic.Tools at my disposal

52112,Can having a concussion cause severe GAD? Preface 23 y.o. male at time of accidentNYE 2012. I smoked a blunt for the first time and the equivalent of overdosed. Legs felt weak had to sit down.I smoked it in at the bottom of my road so I sat down on a neighbour so outside wall roughly 4ft high. Next thing I knew I woke up on the pavement looking up. I later found out from friends that were with me that I had fallen head first onto the concrete sidewalk from about 4 ft high. I am 99.999999 I had a concussion. Anyway next day all was fine no anxiety. Obvious scars and bloody face but nothing else. About two weeks later I decide to play soccer with friends. The ball hit the back of head from behind. I immediately fell to my knees and from what I remember was dizzy etc. then it kind of just went.
15 mins later we left and had a short walk to the local restaurant. Half way there I had immense lain in my stomach and groin area. I fell to my knees again on the sidewalk near the restaurant. I then managed to walk to the restaurant and immediately went into the toilet. I felt sick anxious weird nauseous etc. then cur my first panic attack. Even since then a whole 12 years I had had Generalized Anxiety Disorder diagnosed 2013. How does that even happen? I dont understand how hitting my head would cause that? Did I accidentally damage my amygdalahippocampus when falling?Thanks.,Anxiety
52381,Health issue or health anxiety So before i start let me make clear that i do have some health issue Well had i was born with a unicuspid valve and had open heart surgery 2 years ago. Up to the surgery i was a mental wreck more than before. Now after the surgery ive been Well for the most part. I have had alot of fears after that actually got worse over the two years instead of better. Now to start This story up we gotta rewind a few months its a few days after Christmas im at granny inlaw having a good time when My girlfriend notice My right ankle is a little swollen above the achilles tendon we call the emergency eoc and he wants ud to Come in he frels it and want it scanned with ultrasound. It was fine. Now i didnt Think much of it then but im sure My ankle above the achilles always was swollen but i havent ever really looked much at My ancles.Now here is where it gets difficult two days later we Are home i wake up and notice i have a coin sized point bit left from My sternum with minor painand I get spells of dizziness.At night i get admitted to the ER and they do ultra sound ekg bloodwork work etc. And everythings fine except from slightly elevated troponin which could be scar tissue though they think i have a minor infection in my heart and release me sayinf i should be fine sfter some time but i dont feel fine. Onde home i get This feeling of not being able to get enough air when I breath. A week later im back in the ER they do the usual checks plus a ct and guess what im fine except for the same slightly elevated troponin and they release me Again sayings its just a minor infektion.
3 weeks later i have an appointment with a specialised cardiologist that is educated for valve disease and has byen following me for over a decade. She checks me and im fine My heart is in a good condition. Now i didnt feel happy when told so but extreme dissapointment i started to get a feeling of fear of Them having made a mistake or missed something . The reason being is that before My surgery the hospital i was in the ER at didnt see that My heart wasnt doing Well when I was in for chest painwasnt a heart attack but My valve failing badly the Same pain i have Now. Now i startede going to a psych every third week and its good. But at this point im uncertain of what is wrong ive been checked at the hospital 3times and at a specialized cardiologist and they havent found much that could explain the pain.So im trying to accept the fact it could be anxiety driven but the moment i started trying it i got issues with breathing Again. Its like something in me wants to keeper me in pain and afraid. I Hope some Will read this and give some input.,Anxiety
52548,How I am almost over my Health Anxiety Quick intro
3 years a go I had an incident in the shower that mimicked a stroke. I came out of it unharmed but it messed me up psychologically. Ever since then my body takes any feeling it gets and goes into panic mode. Now i hate driving i hate taking a shower i hate exercising. You name it if i makes me hot i get anxious. At onc point i was so anxious showering i had to sit down and hold on for dear life the entire time i was in there.Now i'm about 80 over it. and form my experience the only way over it is to go through it. And what i mean by that is you need to face this demon head on. I know its the last thing you want to hear but trust me. If you never face it you will be running forever.However it will take time for your brain to rewrite its default path ways. So at the moment the default behavior is fear and to curl up and say please dont hurt me. So your brain interprets it as a threat and will spiral out of control causing all sorts of symptoms the worst of which being a panic attack.Now next time you start getting the fear coming on try this instead. Say to your fear out loud Just kill me then Bring it on Lets see what you can do and taunt your fear and let what ever you think is going to happen happen. by wanting the what ever it is you are afraid of to happen will make the fear vanish.Another thing to think. If you were to say have a heart attack it would just happen... whether you worried or not. Worrying isnt going to some how miraculously save you.At my lowest the turning point for me was when i just thought i'd rather be dead than to feel like this anymore. and from then on i basically laid down my life to my fear and said just kill me. Kill me now or shut the fuck up. I needed to hit rock bottom so I could rebuild my brain the right way. and for a few weeks i just kept saying Kill me now or shut up over and over until my brain started using the new default behavior. It can take months to retrain your brain and then add years on that to fully forget. but this is what is working for me.TLDR Taunt your fear. egg it on. call it out. ask it to do its worst even if it kills you. Let it flow through you and out the other side I bet nothing bad happensTLDR 2 If you were going to die it would just happen... whether you worried or not. Worry isnt going to some how miraculously save you,Anxiety

52727,Having anxiety and PTSD over being excluded from a reunion. Toxic exfriend who socially traumatized me was invited. TLDR Having very mixed feelings over a reunion that I was not invited to but I feel I should have been plus a former friend who socially traumatized me was invitedBackstory I am a pro player at a certain game. I went viral on YouTube and Reddit different profile. The game's official YouTube channel's video of my gameplay has over 5M views and is the third mostviewed video on the channel. I had worked with the game's PR on stuff in the past and was always welcome at events and such.I befriended many other players of this game over social media. I deactivated Facebook in early 2021 because I realized my mental health issues were showing and people were leaving group chats because of me and even unfriending me. I decided to deactivate before I ruined any friendships that meant a lot to me. I still maintain strong friendships with many of my fellow players.For many years the makers of the game said that they would never do a tournament or any kind of bring together the best players event because the player base is just too large and because the game is very luckbased but if you're like me you can sort of manipulate your odds. This year a new person was put in charge of the game and they have decided to finally have a special event reuniting fan favorite players in person most of whom went viral in the same way I did.
15 people were invited and I was not one of them. The day the invitations went out I got several messages from fellow players asking me Did you get invited to the thing?. Many in the community were shocked I was not and one of them said They're missing out without you. When I found out this was happening I started trembling with anxiety for multiple reasons. One being that I was overthinking why I wasn't invited and paranoia that I may be blacklisted I have been very vocal about the game's flaws on social media. One thing that got me was that around the time my gameplay was posted I was often grouped with two other great players in promotional stuff and we were kind of like the defacto GOAT trio we were the top three viewed videos on the YouTube channel at the time though a couple have snuck between us since then. These two people were both invited to the reunion event. I am so happy for those who were invited and I'm trying to convince myself that not everyone could get this opportunity but I can't help but feel hurt and worried.The reunion happened today and I purposefully avoided everyone's social media so I wouldn't have to see photos or anything of them hanging out at bars or restaurants and stuff afterwards. I suffer from FOMO big time. I've flown out to events that friends went to just to avoid FOMO but I didn't have time to fly out for this reunion even to just stop by and say hi. The event is not being publicized until May so I'm going to have to deal with this feeling again in a couple of months.Part of the reason I am anxious about this whole thing is because one of the players who was invited to the reunion is a former close friend of mine. We bonded over the game of course and his high score blew mine out of the water. We discovered we had a lot in common. He also suffers anxiety and he gave me advice on what meds are better than others I still take the one he recommended me to this day. We're also both gay and I found him very attractive as did many others in our community. Our friendship shattered when I went to visit him in person across the country and he showed very manipulative behavior that I was too naive to discern at the time. He purposefully distanced himself from me whenever we were in a room together e.g. sitting on a different couch and excluded me from parties he went to while I was in town to prevent anything sexual happening between us and lying about them. He had been sending me several pictures of him shirtless and in bed with other guys we knew knowing it would turn me on among many other forms of leading me on but never had the courage to say I don't like you like that. Instead he let me come all this way and then gaslit me for trying to come on to him saying it was inappropriate behavior behavior that he exhibited with other guys right in front of me and said It's different with them when I asked. We tried to move on from that experience while staying friends but then he kept making jokes about me with the other guys and I got tired of it. We haven't spoken in months and when we did speak it was only because he had a question about the game.I suffered so much social trauma from this person I trusted and his group of friends who seemed like a Mean Girls Plastics clique that acted polite around me but I later realized they didn't care about me one way or the other. I followed all of them on Instagram and only one followed me back. These people ostracized and humiliated me on top of my friend's various forms of mental and emotional abuse. The trauma only started setting in as months passed and I started crying myself to sleep and sort of reenacting the day everything happened in my head wishing I was more assertive. Now I get PTSD at the mention of his name and I deleted almost every picture I took on my trip to meet him. So since he was invited to the reunion I might have declined if I was invited so I wouldn't have to be in the same room as him because it would have been so triggering for me and I would not have been able to concentrate on the game. That being said I would definitely be willing to take a day to have a serious discussion with this person over how he made me feel and maybe we could start over strictly as friends because I do think he is a good person.I really hope come May when the reunion is made public that I don't suffer any more PTSD. I hope I can find some healthy distractions.Has anyone ever been in a situation like this involving being excluded from an outing involving a traumatic person from your past?,Anxiety
52891,4 years ago I wasnt showering for months at a time depressed anxious and paranoid. At the time I was sober going on 18 19 years. I was and am on disability since 09' for schizoaffective bipolar type disorder. For the longest time especially since sobriety I've been overwhelmed with thinking. Space time behavior tornadoes...whatever. But since my life was an unmanaged train wreck I had no confidence in myself as having any quality. It seems that feeling good about yourself comes from a well managed life. My last job was as a janitor on the army base near by roughly 5 years ago. I couldnt handle the pressure. I was so dependant on others for everything I was asking if I was sweeping properly. Very bad mindset. A lady mentioned crying and it made me feel like crying. I didnt understand how that could be. It seemed like witchcraft so to speak. That was my last day at my last job. It was my 4th attempt to go back to work since my disability badge acquisition! I've been in therapy for 16 or 17 years ago I got into therapy from a mental health episode. During that visit at the crisis stabilisation unit in Virginia Fredricksburg I met a man that changed my life. He went by the name Bose Uncle. He taught me a breathing exercise. 3 in 6 out. You breath in deep for 3 seconds roughly then out for 6 seconds. Also roughly. Dont try to be specific like me and do it exactly 3 and 6. On down the road life and me under pressure and practicing my breathing because sufferage bleep blop bloop pandemic.
