33909,Final doctor appointment tomorrow tired of constantly seeking reassurance! Ive decided that Im having my final doctor appointment tomorrow this is something that has been a huge battle for me but over the last weeks I have decided that this is the only way I can and will make it out of this anxiety.Here is the deal I have been experiencing multiple symptoms as mentioned before in other posts the symptoms have varied from Brain fog dizzyness blurred vision sore throat swollen tonsils coating on my tongue yellow and white very reduced energy fatigue and headaches. The thing is that my sore throat and coating on my tongue wont go away and my doctor said to come back if it didnt fade over time the other symptoms tend to come and go so Ive kinda figured out that these are my main anxiety symptoms which is good because then I know when im getting anxious and stressed out!Ive been a very heavy caffeine user over the past 23 years and ive tried to minimalize the usage of it as I figured out that i basicly needed caffeine to function at times. Today i used a bigger dosage of caffeine and it really got me feeling off so I guess i will be dropping it off completely atleast for now when im feeling anxious and stressed out about my health situation.Even though I feel somewhat weak and off Ive learned a lot from this fear of health problems and I personally think that it had made me a more strong and better person. Tomorrow I will have my final chat with my doctor and I am ready to accept his word for the truth hopefully this will take my mind to other places. Its wierd how something as minor as a sore throat lasting for a long time can make you feel so sure its something serious!,Anxiety
33910,Anyone have bone or muscle pain that was stressanxiety induced? Ive been having joint and muscle pain that worries me that I have leukemia. Anyone else deal with this?,Anxiety
33911,Listening to your body? I'm curious how those of us with health anxiety can listen to our bodies. It seems the general advice when trying to figure out what's wrong is listen to your body you know it best you tell your doctor when something is off. But it doesn't really work that way when I'm convinced every itch means I have lymphoma or a pimple is a tumour...so how can people with health anxiety know when something is wrong?! I am starting to hate that I just want to trust my doctor is right when she says I'm fine!,Anxiety

33913,This is killing me So i had a bacterial stomach infectionpain in the right side thought it was appendix. Doctor gave some antibiotics and the pain went away. But that infection gave me health anxiety for life.Ive been having excessive gas since a month which is mostly due to stress. I was convinced i had stomach cancer but no black stools or blood and Im 20 so doctor ruled that out.Then i was convinced that my kidney failed but no. I googled a lot that night and was sure of it woke up breathless that night.. insomnia took over.Then i was convinced that i have brain tumorgoogle is evil but havent really had even a single symptom.The only concern now is insomnia has been a month now I generally get 68 hours a day but wake up once or twice a night Im generally a deep sleeper.Any solutions?,Anxiety

33915,Health anxiety following stomach flu anyone else? I have moderate to severe health anxiety especially when Im sick then its pretty severe. About 6 days ago I came down with a stomach virus and was violently puking and had water like diarrhea sorry if TMI. By day 3 I was no longer feeling the nausea or diarrhea but have a general sense of being unwelldehydrateddrained.

Is it normal for constant worrying to drain you and wear you out physically??? ,Anxiety
33916,The worst things about hypochondria Hypochondria is the worst thing to ever happen to me everyday Im crippled by it. I guess I just wanted to make a list of all the worst things I go through as a hypochondriac. Seeing healthy people and wishing you were like them even though you probably are healthy but your brain is telling you youre not Changing daily routines based off the health issue you think you have at the time Changing your entire diet to become healthier for me it has been limiting carbs and sugars because Im afraid of developing diabetes Checking your pulse all the time to make sure your heart is beating properly unfortunately for me my heart is never beating normally I have constant heart palpitations and my heart races a lot not even sure if its due to anxiety. Im scared its something serious Having very bad mental health days where you cant leave your house this happens to me a lot Not knowing if your symptoms are caused by anxiety or something serious this drives me absolutely insane Not being able to lead a normal productive for me I cant hold a job because I always fear something bad will happen to me at work and Ill panic Being triggered by seeing things on shows or in movies. For instance a man has a heart attack in the show your watching and then you freak out about having a heart attack Obsessively looking up symptoms and not being able to stop once you start Wasting a ton of money on doctors appointments only for them to say youre okay Being in tons of debt from going to the ER because you think youre dying Always looking for reassurance from others obsessively asking others if they ever have the same symptoms as you so you dont feel alone These are the only ones I can think of right now but feel free to list the things you deal with as a hypochondriac Im curious about what others go through.,Anxiety

33918,I might be losing my mind... Ive been suffering from health anxiety for around 6 months now. In the last 6 months Ive convinced myself Ive had pelvic inflammatory disease cervical cancer arthritis periodontitis and most recently lymphoma.I have a swollen lymph node on my neck that feels like two small lymph nodes stuck together Im worried they are matted which typically points to cancer. I noticed the lump about two weeks ago its maybe 1.5cm in size and moves when I press on it.Every day I bounce back and forth between anxiety and calmness. Although I say this each time I think I have a new disease it seems so real this time and I have no idea what to do...,Anxiety
33919,I've been crying all day sure my time is up About 3 years ago a good friend of mine passed away from acute leukemia at the age of 19. I was devastated and with a lifelong battle with health anxiety it always lingered in my mind anytime I would get ill. Would this be the time I faced the same fate?Well now this time I'm more or less certain that the time has come. I came down with some infection from a coworker back on November 18th. At first is was merely a slight sore throat some coughing malaise. I began to feel better around the end of November. Then the first week of December the sore throat came back. And fever severe congestion cough fatigue achy muscles amongst other things. I began to feel better from that but have not been the same since. As of right now I have a terrible cough irritated throat congestion. I have been having night sweats where my neck and head get very damp but I am not drenched and it only affects the head and neck. I am simply not myself. The positives that have kept me hopeful I do not have acute leukemia I have been able to make it to the gym to lift about 34 times a week. I don't have much motivation to do so but I make it and my strength is still there. I have not lost any weight gained a few pounds actually currently at 6'0 and 220 poundswhen I do feel bad I'm never running a fever my temp is usually somewhere between 96.9 and 98.5I'm not bruising at all even after bumping into things and I don't have any petechia anywhere to suggest low platelets my infections haven't been severe per se. I haven't had sore throats like that of strep and no mouth sores or bleeding gums they've just been persistent I've been going out on the weekends with friends for a few drinks which ironically when I am not sober I do not experience night sweats at all the guy who originally got me sick is still sick himself and my entire family is sick back and forthBut nonetheless I can't help but think this is it for me. I just keep looking at pictures of my mom or baby sister or handmade birthday cards from my sister just little sentimental things and I start crying like a baby. I don't want to leave them I don't want my family and friends to go through what my friend's loved ones went through three years ago when they lost her I love life so much and I don't want it to end. It's all I can think about though. I don't really know where to go from here. Nobody in my family thinks it's odd I've been sick for the better part of 6 weeks and I put on a front to everyone that I'm fine to not alarm them but on the inside I'm falling apart.,Anxiety
33920,Extreme tiredness all day every day Lately I've been sleeping 12 hours a night and I wake up extremely tired I can't move for hours because of the overwhelming tiredness. I keep falling back asleep after I hit snooze and I have intense dreams right away then my alarm goes off again and the same repeats until I drag myself out of bed because I'm too hungry. I am extremely tired all day as if I had multiple sleepless nights in a row while I actually sleep 11 hours per night. I'm Feverish but no fever most of the time I feel like my forehead and eyes are hot and heavy cold chills with sweating extreme fatigue muscular pain all over. I feel like I can't function properly I'm sluggish and think slowly my mind is clouded. My eyes keep going out of focus randomly. When someone talks to me their voice echoes in my head as if it was waking me up while I'm already up and awake. I randomly start falling asleepzone out even when standing up and get a falling sensation when trying to resist. It's true I had insomnia for awhile and whatnot but I don't know why I keep being so tired now that I am sleeping. I do wake up multiple times per night because my mouth is dry or because I have to pee or other things but it's not really new. I think my sleep is just not normal or something is very wrong with me.I'm tired of being tired. I've convinced myself I probably have leukemia anemia sleep apnea narcolepsy or something else. I don't even have the energy to go to the doctor.Am i dying?Edit I've been taking Nexium for 5 months and the leaflet says it can mess with your white blood cells causing intense fatigue pain all over and a fever. It can also cause hyponatremia hypomagnesemia hallucinations insomnia Etc. maybe that's the culprit? The side effect list also reads Sleep disorder what could it mean? I've tired stopping this drug but it's making me sick.,Anxiety
33921,2018 already panicking... So last year I had multiple blood tests an Xray and an ultrasound due to abdominal pain. I was also getting pains in my legs and weird hot sensations too.

No idea of the cause. Worried as fuck. Also keep waking up itching since I had oral thrush and took some meds left me itching on and off and had a rash this morning on my arms. Anyone have any ideas. All I can think is strain of some kind or low vitamin d but Id expect that to show up in a blood test. Totally stressed about it all. ,Anxiety

33926,Convinced I have lymphoma So I just turned 20 and I have myself totally convinced I have lymphoma. About two months ago I noticed a lymph node on the left side of my neck that was enlarged. Well it's still there. It doesn't hurt which I've read is more worrisome than painful ones it fluctuates in size throughout the day its not rock hard but it's not really soft and I can't really move it that much. I'm really worried that it's lymphoma I don't have any swollen lymph nodes under my arms groin or collarbone that I can tell. Nor do I have any other symptoms that are commonly associated with lymphoma but I know that a lot of people don't show any symptoms so it's not really reassuring. I don't have health insurance so I can't go to the doctor as I please. However I am trying to get into this affordable doctor near me within the next couple of weeks to ease my mind. I've been having panic attacks over it last night I had one and I was seriously about to go to the ER but my boyfriend talked me down. It's so exhausting. Edit Also I haven't had any infections or been sick to cause the swelling ,Anxiety
33927,Heart health anxiety Hi all stumbled across this sub doing what else some late night symptom googling and I couldn't be more glad to see it. I've had generalized anxiety for years but recently it's started to manifest more as health anxiety triggered when my cat died of sudden onset congestive heart failure a few months ago. I've had chest pain in the upper left side for almost a week now and I can't seem to convince myself that I'm not dying. I've had two normal EKGs normal bloodwork except for an elevated d dimer level and a normal xray and CT. After all that I'm still not able to stop my anxiety that the twinge in my arm is a heart attack or the burning sensation in my back is an aortic dissection. Any suggestions for calming the anxiety beast? ,Anxiety

I have no other symptoms other that minor twitching that could be from researching so much on google. My grandmother died of ALS so it worries me whenever I have nerve issues. ,Anxiety
33929,Finally getting better. My anxiety was to a point where every few days I was posting in the sub and rAnxiety. I suspect my anxiety was worsened by being on antibiotics at pretty heavy doses destroying my gut bacteria and a hormone imbalance from going on and off of birth control after 5 years of being on it been off it for 3 months now. Noticed it was WAY worse in the week leading up to my period the week of and a week after. This cycle I actually only had anxiety during and before it was because I was flying huge fear of mine. Whatever imbalances I had I think they've finally begun to balance out.Now my only health fear at this moment is a DVT from the flight from LAX to Hawaii even though I know it's mostly from long haul flights and I obsessively made sure to move in my seat as much as possible... not to mention I was rather active during my stay in Hawaii. My left leg has some weird muscle twitches every so often but none of the other symptoms in fact the twitches aren't even a symptom. But damn I'm so much better than I was at my peak anxiety weeks. This year going to go to therapy and I've started exercising though I'm afraid my heart will give out despite being only 21 pretty healthy with a perfect EKG and no health issues and a former athlete my heart races bc I'm simply just out of shape... baby steps. What helped me a lot was writing down my instances of anxiety and working through them. It's called ABC therapy model used in CBT. httpimages.slideplayer.com206041594slidesslide10.jpgWhen I wrote down my current fixation such as a brain tumor I wrote down why I felt that way even symptoms! reasons why it's probably not likely had two physical brain checks docs said I was fine just head and neck tension and I didn't have any severe symptoms. Then I wrote how I felt after working through it.Pinpointing my anxiety to particular times such as my period helped me realize that it's really likelu just a hormonal thing and ya know every time I was about to be or on my period I probably didn't have cancer or a tumor or some horrible disease or ailment because I knew it was most likely just anxiety. I encourage you all to journal your anxiety! It helps you see trends it helps a ton to rationalize. ,Anxiety
33930,Soapy taste in mouth. Sodium Fluoride poisoning? I started noticing a soapy aftertaste when I was drinking coffee a little while ago. I first thought it was something in the coffee maker but I then drank some water and it had the same soapy after taste. I had a friend taste the water and they said they didn't taste any soapiness. It became obvious it was just me. It's possible I got some shampoo in my mouth when I shower shortly before drinking the coffee but I don't remember that happening. I decided to Google soapy taste in mouth and it said it's a possible symptom of sodium fluoride poisoning. My hypochondriac side started getting worried. I drink a lot of unfiltered tap water but I don't know if that's enough to get sodium fluoride poisoning.I just got over a cold so I don't know if that has anything to do it. This seems like a silly thing to be worried about but Google gets me paranoid as usual.Am I good?,Anxiety

33932,Panic attacks and asthma So recently Ive been having regular panic attacks again after them being gone for about 5 and a half months. I am managing them ok to my standards but I have one problem. At a young age I was diagnosed with asthma and I still use my inhaler from time to time. Because of this whenever I have a panic attack Im ok until I think about the usual breathing exercises. Then I get super conscious about my breathing and hyperventilate thinking Im suffering from an asthma attack even though I know it isnt one. How do I stop this?,Anxiety
33933,Flat Stool and Dull Stomach Pain. Could it be IBS? Colon Cancer? Just flat out Anxiety? Lately I've noticed that my stool has been softer floating and generally flatter than before. They are not absurdly flat you'd only notice it if you examined them closely because they float around. I've really noticed this over the past couple of weeks. I haven't really had a solid and long stool in a while. In addition to this I've been having some dull abdominal pain that kind of radiates on my sides and in the middle of my abdomen. Nothing that keeps me from walking around and exercising though. The pain radiates for a couple of minutes and subsides when I stop thinking about it.I went to the doctor two weeks ago complaining about the abdominal pain this was before I noticed anything about the poop. I had a blood test and a urine test taken and basically they came back all clear. For the record I'm 19 male and overweight. My college diet combined with inaccessibility to the gym has caused me to gain weight over the past two years.My biggest questions for are these When is the right time to contact my doctor again? Since the blood and urine tests came back completely normal is it right to assume that my stool is just a byproduct of me being anxious and general change of diet? I'm on my school's winter break. Meaning this is a big diet change and physical activity change. I'm no longer eating food in bad dining halls I'm making my own.IBS? Colon Cancer?? Please help me out. From Googling I'm convinced I want a colonoscopy.,Anxiety
33934,Feels like there's Urine stuck in my penis all the time? Did and urine test and xrays. Didn't hear back from either of them.

33935,Does anyone else worry about earlyonset dementia? Firstly I lurk here from time to time and I don't see this come up very often so I'm sorry if this gives anyone yet more to worry about. Feel free to stop reading now!I don't know how this has got into my head but you know how these things can suddenly take hold right? You read something by mistake or someone tells you something you didn't want to hear about how this guy got diagnosed with Alzheimer's in his 30s or whatever and suddenly it's occupying your every waking moment. These ideas have taken root in my mind and I can't make them go away.I've been under a lot of stress at work for a long time. I'm responsible for the finances in a company which has been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy for several years and in September I had my first ever panic attack over worries that we wouldn't be able to make payroll. I know intellectually that the symptoms I'm experiencing can rationally be explained by this but still. I can't stop thinking about it. I've felt over the past few months that I can't think or write as fluently as I could. I make more mistakes. I feel scatterbrained and foggy and I struggle to concentrate. I feel like it takes me longer to do things that should be much easier than I'm finding them.It's led me to start compulsively and repeatedly testing myself on things I should know which of course makes the anxiety and racing thoughts worse. Can't instantly recall all my PINs and passwords? Dementia. Can't find the right word while I'm talking? Dementia. Repeat myself while I'm typing a sentence? Dementia. Can't remember who starred in that film I saw last week? Dementia. Can't remember every detail of my journey to work? Dementia. It's taken me ages to write this. Dementia.Flash forward a few years and I see myself sat in a chair unable to recognise my family . It's horrible.I just wanted to get this out. I know there are a lot of people in this sub who will have fellow feeling. Hope you're all doing OK.,Anxiety

For the past few days Ive had this pins and needles sensation all over kind of like a numbness like I can see myself doing thing but I dont feel it the same way.

33939,Dr.s office blew up my phone about results of blood test Ive been suffering from health anxiety for a few months now after a lymes disease scare in November. I found myself fine tuned to any achespains in my body at this time out of paranoia of getting lymes disease. After my blood test came back negative I still felt these aches and pains and now started to attribute them to severe diseases like cancer and driving myself crazy. These pains seem to be deep in my bone and very painful but I simply dont know if theyre psychosomatic or real. I find it hard to believe I could imagine these pains but at the same time I didnt feel these pains before my scare back in November. I finally went to get a physical for the first time in 4 years last week and also requested a blood test.Fast forward to today an unknown number called me 4 times and left a message the last time. It was the Dr.s office notifying me my blood results came in. I feel very uneasy about this... why not call once and leave a message? The multiple calls are freaking me out and makes me feel the results are really bad. Also does anyone know if my Lyme blood tests wouldve tested for cancer as well? Im 22 years old if this helps btw. Thank you!,Anxiety
33940,Wheezing and trouble getting air Damn hypochondria is driving me crazy. Every little thing that I find wrong with me makes me immediately conclude that I have cancer. This time I have realized that my breath is whistling when I exhale wheezing. I also feel like I cannot get enough air and must take deep breaths every 45 seconds or so. This has been going on for roughly three weeks and has not improved.Are there minor conditions that could be causing this? I hate hate hate that I automatically assume that I am going to die whenever I discover something like this. Any help would be greatly appreciated. ,Anxiety
33941,Nonstop Coughing It all started last Saturday when I started coughing up a little mucus. I passed it off as my asthma but the coughing since then has gotten worse and today I am running a lowgrade fever. I'm really concerned that this is walking pneumonia and I just can't deal with that right now. I have to attend a funeral out of state this weekend and the thought of being sick and having to stay in a hotel room is just dreadful. The coughing is so persistent now that my throat is raw from it and I'm scared I'll start coughing up blood. Oddly enough my anxiety is not as bad over this but I'm still pretty stressed out nonetheless.,Anxiety
33942,Fear of getting pneumonia Sorry if it sounds stupid and selfish but...My dad had to visit his mother in the hospital we still don't know what she has but there are high chances that it might either be pneumonia or something worse.

33944,Could I have chronic appendicitis? Hello I found this subreddit yesterday and it kinda makes me feel good that I know I'm not alone. About 3 days ago I started to feel pain in my lower right abdomen. I only felt it when I was moving and coughing. Yesterday 2nd day of pain it started to hurt more about 610. Today it's better but i still feel it. I didn't feel any pain when I touched it but today I feel it a little even when it's better when movingcoughing. I am scared of what it could be. Do you think it's normal to feel this kind of constant pain for 3 days straight? Btw I was on 4 sets of antibiotics last 23 months I was even hospitalized because of 10kg weight loss but it was probably due to mononucleosis I had. All tests in hospital went fine. Thanks for answers! I'm really scared that I have some serious condition like all of us of course.,Anxiety

33946,Dealing with Health Anxiety when you are looking forward to something that won't happen for several more months Does anyone's health anxiety increase when you start getting excited and start anticipating something that is a long time away like several months or a year? For example my wife and I booked a cruise in April. Everything is already paid for all we have to do is show up. Unfortunately when I start getting excited for it my health anxiety kicks in and I can't help but think that I might not make it because the symptoms that my anxiety produces and that my mind thinks are real will end me before I can experience it. I feel like that heart attack that I've been worried about having for the past 10 years will finally occur and prove every doctor I have seen wrong and that it will be the reason I won't be alive to experience this time that I am so looking forward too. Anyways just venting. This happens to me on most everything that I am looking forward too if it's a long ways out.,Anxiety

33949,Trying a new way of thinking. My day normally looks something like this...Oh man I'm dizzy. I wonder what that means. Any my left arm is weak. Is that a heart attack? Maybe a symptom of a small heart attack? Where did I get that bruse on my knee? Is that a sign of a blood clot? Should I go to the doctor again? Last time he told me to stop worrying about stuff like this. Is that a lump I'm the back of my head? Maybe that's what's causing my head ache... But what is the lump is another sign of a problem? Should I start documenting this? The doctor thinks I'm crazy but if I have all the symptoms with the times I had them he could surly run more tests. A friend I knew died for a blood clot that the doctors missed maybe my doctor missed something... etcRecently I started asking my friends that don't have anxiety how they deal with strange feelings in their body. Every single one of them says that they almost immediately dismiss the thought. I can't even imagine what that feels like. I focus on a part of my body so much sometimes that I actually create pain that doesn't exist. So I dug a little bit deeper and asked what happens if they were walking around one day and all of a sudden they noticed that their left arm was weak and tingly. Most of my friends with without anxiety said the same thing. I guess my arm is weak today. And then that's it. If they have a headache or if they have a chest pain or if they have an upset stomach or if their leg hurts out of nowhere they just shrug it off and think oh I guess today I'm going to have a stomach ache or I guess I'm coming down with something or something to that nature. And then if it still hurts the next day they shrug it off again and only when it's continuing to do it for like a week do they actually think I'll maybe I should go to the doctor and have it looked at. But it's not in a panicky kind of way it's just kind of like almost annoyance.So I'm going to try that method. Oh I guess I have a headache today. And try to leave it at that. If it lasts a week all the talk to my doctor.Has anyone had success doing something like this? Like just changing the way you thought?,Anxiety

I just woke up 10 minutes ago and my heart was beating 80 times per minute and way harder than normal. it's now 20 minutes since I woke up and it's going back down closer to normal.

33953,One hell of a year Hi just discovered this subreddit and wanted to sort of share my experience with this. For the last 7 months or so I was totally convinced I had some sort of cancer. It all started when noticed a swollen lymph node on the side of my neck. The lymph node had been swollen for about 2 years and i never thought anything of it until i went to ol' Dr Google. Fast forward countless doctors appointments a spur of the moment ER visit CT Scans and an eventual biopsy and it turns out I don't have any life threatening conditions. I got so obsessed with cancer that I started going to dermatology clinics because I was convinced that some of my moles looked suspicious of course they were fine. I mean I worked outside a lot without sunscreen and a permanently swollen lymph node is unusual so I guess I was right to be somewhat concerned. However I really blew it all out of proportion for a long time and despite all evidence pointing to being healthy I cannot shake this sense of impending doom that I've had for the last 7 months. It's honestly making it hard to move on with my life and enjoy things. Anyone else have issues like this? How do you deal with it?,Anxiety
33954,I cant wait for this health anxiety phase to be over with. Als or carpal tunnel? Female age 26Duration of complaint 3 weeks. Area on body hands arms sometimes feet and thighs. I went to the doctor a week ago who diagnosed me with carpal tunnel. And gave me a brace that helped a little. Hand pain coincided with symptoms of carpal tunnel but it still made me nervous because my grandmother died of als and nerve pain always puts me on edge. I dont show any other signs of als besides very little muscle twitching. I am doing some weird things to test myself through out the day. For example. Testing my WPM words per minute that I can type. Which is 75 words per minute . I do this to see if I have any weakness in my hands I am standing on one foot to see if I can balance myself and shit like that. Also tonight I just came home from dinner and I was holding a fork and I noticed it felt very odd in my hands. It was a heavier than normal fork because it was at a steak house. I also have health anxiety but I wish I knew I was okay. So I can stop worrying. I feel some pins and needles in my hands and light shooting pain in my arms and feet and thighs. Any help would be appreciated . Thank you. ,Anxiety
33955,I think I have bone cancer Im 20 years old male and im 6' 3 170 lbsLet me start of by saying that for most of my life i think i have symptoms and i think im gonna die everytime untill i finally go to the doctor aand find out its some minor problem.Ok so in spring of 2015 i noticed the muscle above my knee was twitching a lot so i got into the habit of feeling that area every day until i noticed a hard lump developing on my bone. I was CERTIAN i had bone cancer until i found out i had osteochondroma wich is a benign tumor and not life threatining. I decided not to have it removed.Two years later this last summer i started have muscle twitches all over my body. Those lasted like 5 months and they still happen occasionally but mostly they've been replaced by painfultender spots on various bones in my body including my spine.Anyways the bones in my feet hurt a lot and in my hands. Butttt basically every bone in my body has a spot where it hurts.My pee also started burning last summer and i was tested for various STDs and the doctor just kinda brushed it off just like he did with all of the other symptoms im describing. And idk if this is related but ive been constipated for 11 days but i can go with laxatives.I usually go to the gym but havent in a week in a half due to travel and ive actually gained 20 pounds in muscle over the last 6 months.What i really want to know is there ANY possibility that this isnt serious?And for those wondering i'm going to the doctor to get this checked out as soon as im back in town.Also i stopped taking my adhd meds about a month ago that id been taking for 5 years,Anxiety
33956,Hey guys. Please check this out. My heart goes out to all of you experiencing this. It is crippling and mental torture when it gets out of hand and it feels like it has so much control over you. The world definitely puts enough things out there to scare us but not enough to comfort us and assuage our fears. There is definitely a lack of balance and it's so frustrating because mental health is SO important. Anxiety can make you feel like you are going crazy and to me that is the scariest and most deeply troubling symptom. The feeling that I can't trust my mindmyself and that I've lost who I am completely and I'll never be the same. That's what fear and anxiety can do to you when not properly addressed! That being said after WEEKS of constantly and I mean CONSTANTLY searching on google for selfhelp I have FINALLY found a resource that is starting to help me. Most of the resources I've found only scratch the surface and are really tailored to mild anxiety they don't really help. I am only on the second module but this is the most helpful source I have found for this illness and I am hopeful that I will get better. Please please pleaseeeee at least look at this. Give it a chance and open your mind to the possibility that you can be okay again. Much love Helping Health Anxiety httpwww.cci.health.wa.gov.auresourcesinfopax.cfm?InfoID53 ,Anxiety

33960,Slipped and fell two weeks ago and afraid of getting a scan I slipped and fell on my right side. I only had a small visible bruise on my upper thigh by my waist.However it seems it affected my whole leg. My upper thigh is tight and it feels like if you exercised and overstretched it. My knee is tight also doesn't seem smooth when I move it and has been poppingcracking alot more. I have full range of motion but everything still feels sore. I really wanted to avoid going to the doctor but I might have no choice. A couple days ago I was in a dentist's office and I read an article about CT scans in Men's Health. It was basically talking about how risky it is especially for young people because of how much radiation it gives off. I'm not sure what the doctor would order for me but I'm afraid of getting into a situation where I either have to refuse doctor's orders or get a scan and then have anxiety for the rest of my life about getting cancer from the radiation.,Anxiety

For example I was laying in bed on my not very heavy laptop and I accidentally pushed it into my chin. It wasn't a super hard hit it didn't hurt but I immediately started worrying that I could have a concussion. My head was against a pillow too but the reading I did claimed that it's worse if your head doesn't move.I mean I don't notice myself feeling especially nauseaous or dizzy but I can't stop worrying. It seems like most concussion stories involve something more significant than that. Are small hits like that something to worry about? Does anyone have any expertise as when to start worrying about a concussion?,Anxiety
33964,heart health anxiety hi guys. this is my first time posting. Ive been dealing with health anxiety for the past 6 years and my new focus is my heart. I have a mitral valve prolapse and Im currently taking a beta blocker to help with palpitations. Ive been to the ER and a cardiologist all who have sent me home saying that I am fine.

But because of this mornings pain couple with this pain Im nervous. It comes and goes and feels like an ache of some sort.

33966,Distraction techniques? I suffer from extreme health anxiety my main fears being that I will spontaneously drop dead from a heart attack or stroke. If I feel my heart acting up from palpitations or if I feel like my face feels strange it will send me off the deep end. It's so frustrating that I fixate on this every single day. I would love to hear how everyone distracts themselves when they are at the peak of their anxiety. Sometimes watching a light hearted show like Family Guy helps me. A lot of times if I'm talking to a friend on the phone I won't even notice any of my symptoms which I take as a sign it's all in my head!.

Almost like a skipped beat and it makes me cough.,Anxiety
33968,Should a low blood pressure and pulse rate be concerning at an odd time? I was at this enormous concert recently over 10000 people in one room 5 big screens lord knows how many speakers etc. It was the first concert I've ever been to because I don't really like loud noise but there were a couple speakers there I wanted to see it was more of a conference with several hours of music. Previously unbeknownst to me the music was incredibly loud and there were continuous lights flashing all different colors and directions. I'm a pretty introverted quiet guy so this wasn't my idea of a good time but that's not confusing.What confuses me is that my pulse dropped. It was a day long event but I'm in good shape so I doubt that was an issue. I noticed because I started getting dizzy got a headache and was tired enough to sit and close my eyes amidst all the hype. To my chagrin and embarrassment several people asked me if I was okay which I appreciated but felt deeply uncomfortable with. My resting heart rate is about 64 and I'd thought it'd be elevated with the very overwhelming to me at least stimulus for an extended period of time. Instead I measured it and it was right at 42. Wtf was going on? I didn't leave because I didn't want to ruin everyone's time but seriously is something wrong with me? No one else had this. It made me feel alienated and uncomfortable when I should have been having a great time. I've never had a panic attack or any prolonged health issues so idk what happened. Was this just an anxiety thing or is that an actual health issue. I'm not going to ask anyone because frankly it was embarrassing. To clarify I'm not asking you to diagnose anything I just want to if anyone has felt something similar. Thanks in advance for any help.Edit Grammar and spelling,Anxiety

33971,Advice Hey everybody you may have seen me post on here a lot recently and I do apologise for that I don't want to waste anyone's time. However since November when I'm stupidly ingested cannabis one night and ended up in hospital because my heart went to fast my anxiety has got so much worse. That night in hospital I was convinced I was gonna have a heart attack and die I was in so much pain and agony and in the ambulance the paramedics said my heart was going to fast but this was down to anxiety and nothing wrong with my heart. Same in the hospital they tried to treat my heart with medication but they couldn't slow it down they said this was because it was not an irregular heart it was normal just a bit fast once again due to anxiety so I was left over night and discharged the next day. December 4th I dislocated my knee for the 2nd time and while waiting to be seen in hospital my heart went to fast so they put me in a ward over night and did all the tests bloody tests for my heart and ecgs nothing once again and anxiety once again. Then after that is when my intrusive thoughts started and that went on for a few weeks I still get it on and off now however. But the last 23 days my heart has been going fast I'm losing my breath easily and I can feel my heart palpitating I've had countless doctors and tests look at me and nothing to do with my heart? I've even rang a hotline about this and they said anxiety does all this it seems to go in a cycle my thoughts then everything is okay for a while then my heart and thoughts again can anyone help?,Anxiety

Im getting down to single digits on days and I feel terrible at nights. Ill experience acid reflux or muscularskeletal pains etc. Right now I have a pain under my right rib cage and I feel like its my pancreas or something .

And now Im in a worse mood because I wont get the results then Ill still need to wait a week or two on top of that . ,Anxiety

33976,Worried something is wrong with my heart I have been having occasional chest pains on and off for a week and a half now and I've been struggling to sleep. Well I was taking a bath after exercising and I didn't really do anything but turn to the side to reach for some bath gel and I felt something similar to a pop in my chest. It was right in the area that my heart would be. I thought it was odd and when I stood slowly I felt a little light headed to get out of the bath. I had two short quick pains in that same spot and now I haven't had any pain since that. There is no heaviness in my chest. My stomach is fine. But my heart has been feeling like it's been pounding not long after that. I've been feeling like I should just give in and head to the ER.. It's taking everything I have to not ask to go because I don't want to go and end up getting a big bill over nothing because I don't think my insurance will cover it. I'm inwardly freaking out now.,Anxiety

I did it and after about two weeks now I feel less frequent headaches but when I feel it it feels more intense I don't know if it was because of the exercises but I'm scared thinking this supposed aneurysm is getting larger and it's going to rupture Thanks.Everytime I go to the doctor my blood pressure is high because of tenseness I always think that these high blood pressure moments created an aneurysm ,Anxiety

33984,Going to Battle HA? Hi AllFirst time posting here. So grateful to have found this community. I have struggled with HA for the last 10 years with each year worse than the one before. For the last 6 months my HA has been with leukemia. Usually my anxiety with any illness is from a few days to a few weeks but never on the order of months. Enough is enough! I no longer want to live in fear of any random bruise I am thin and bruise like a peach or to have my husband constantly reassure me that I dont have cancer and engage in my safety behaviors. A relative of mine is actually a clinical psychologist who deals with anxiety disorders. She referred me to a wellrespected clinic that is able to work with my insurance and they want to schedule me for the intake. The problem? Im scared to actually take the next step and start therapy. Ive avoided dealing with my triggers and upbringing that promoted me becoming this way. The clinic specializes in exposure therapy for anxiety disorders and I am so scared thinking about putting myself in even controlled situations that will manufacture my anxiety. Has anyone successfully done therapy and conquered the HA monster? I just need to pickup the phone and make the call. Would love to make progress on this in 2018. Help?,Anxiety

Im currently living in France and I have a doctors appointment on Wednesday but I keep convincing myself I have it and Im going to die.

33989,question regarding fingers slightly moving. Is it normal?Not sure if I can classify it as 'tremors'Basically from what I've seen with different kinds of videos regarding tremors it doesn't look like it.Let's say I put my hands in the air facing my palm or just in the bed resting it doesn't shake or what.But sometimes if I look at them long enough I notice it they slightly move.Not sure if I'm doing it voluntarily I'm being anxious thus making it move or maybe because I'm not used to holding that kind of position it kinda moves because of it?If anything I type a lot in a computer. Upon searching I've seen that they might just been twitching due to fatigue so maybe that's what it is?As much as possible I don't want to go to a doctor just because of this.Thanks,Anxiety
33990,I finally saw the cardiologist today I had multiple ECGs bloodwork done I wore a twoweek loop and I had an echocardiogram over a month ago and today I did a stress test. I've been having HORRIBLE anxiety about my heart for over a month and a half. My heart is completely healthy. No blockages and no damage to it whatsoever. This is one of my happier days!!! They told me the chest pain which I can reproduce by touching it is likely caused by either anxiety or costochondritis and the heavy tightness is likely anemia which I can deal with much better than heart disease. The left arm pain is probably from inflammation because I lay on it so awkwardly and for too long at night. I'm OK ' Anxiety is a bitch guys. It can make you truly believe and FEEL the most frustrating and uncomfortable symptoms. I'm not saying to dismiss everything as anxiety it will always be better to see a doctor but what I am saying is none of you are alone. Thanks to everyone here who supported me through this. I can move on and focus on fixing my inflammation and anemia!! ,Anxiety

33994,Health Anxiety after panic attack Almost a year ago I had a panic attack that I thought was a heart attack. I've never had either and at the time I didn't know that panic attack symptoms can mimic heart attacks. I had a friend take me to the ER and I was freaking out in the ER while waiting to be seen. I remember thinking man this is it this is how I'm going to die and I'm away from family wife and kids and everyone I love and I'm stuck in a place I hate and it scared me so badly. Anyway since then I've almost had myself convinced that I was going to die and it was going to be from a heart attack. I've been prescribed Buspirone and it keeps me from having panic attacks and I've come a long way from the panic attacks every day to almost having none. There's been a few times in the past few months where if I wasn't taking medication I could've had a pretty bad attack. One of them was last week where my mind just kind of ran away while I was driving home from work and for some reason my mind was looping you're gonna die and probably run into oncoming traffic look now you're barely breathing and I had to calm myself down. It sometimes takes me a really long to get calm and sometimes I can calm myself almost immediately. The thing about this though that I really hate is that the anxiety is always there always either in the back of my mind or I'm actively thinking about it. I've set an appointment with a psychologist for a few weeks from now and I really want to get off the meds. They have some side effects that I really don't like and they are considered mild. Are there any of you who suffer from the same kind of health anxiety that I do? I don't know anyone personally who does at least not in the way it is with me. Some coworkers had anxiety issues in the recent past but it looks like I'm the only one who suffers 247 and it looks like it's a permanent thing in my life. ,Anxiety

33997,Dog died on New Years scared of rabies Okay so I posted this on the anxiety subreddit and that should of been enough but my anxiety still is being awful so uh posting this here too since health anxiety is a big one for be in general anyway...? Sorry Basically I had an old dog like 14 years old. He started sleeping a lot more around Christmas and all and when I cold front blew in that week he started having a harder time walking around he'd been wobbly already and then Thursday he collapsed on his front legs and couldn't eat back up. His front legs couldn't move but back legs were fine and he ate and drank what we gave him fine. During that Thursday I absent minded lot scratched the inside of my nose after doing something and he licked which is what started the paranoia.My poor dog couldn't move but his back legs still could and his jaw never got paralyzed and he never got the excess salivating deal.We have him pain meds at a vets advice which seemed to of gotten his front legs working again still back legs working too he just couldn't get up yet. But he was moving more his head too. He even ate that day. Unfortunately he started bloating fell into a coma and died that day which was New Years.I've brought my paranoia up with the vet and he did say with everything I told him and showed him that rabies shouldn't even be a concern. Another commenter seemed to agree too.And yeah I know better he wasn't even paralyzed in that way it was the pain in his bones the pain meds helped him in those final moments. And he never had a hanging mouth he could move it and eat fine and didn't foam or excessively salivate or anything. But even still I've been absolutely paranoid every since despite knowing better. Despite knowing that wouldn't of been rabies since if it was his limbs wouldn't of gotten better but my mind keeps telling me what if it is what if it is what if it's too late and you'll have it and your mom will have it and you'll dieUgh. I know I'm going to get a full doctor checkup tomorrow and take steps to get help with my anxiety but as it is right now it still feels so awful and constraining. I can't even focus on my usually drawing or other creative ideas because this anxiety has gotten in the way so much. I can't even properly grieve my dogs death because of this. I'm scared despite being told that it shouldn't even be a consideration. I hate it.,Anxiety

34000,Toxic shock syndrome fear Okay this is kind of uh detailed beware. Im afraid of getting TSS because i read this horrifying ass thing about people getting it even without leaving in tampons too long or anything. And all this stuff about how horrible tampons are for you. And people were commenting under it about how someone they know even got it from pads and every other period product and it basically just strikes randomly. And people having to get their legs amputated of they didnt die already. And like if you have any open wounds or anything you can get it from that too. And basically just making it seem like youre gonna get it just by existing and having periods. Like what if i have some kind of injury from shaving or something i dont even know about?? Am i gonna get this illness just from having a period? Im an athlete and all too its really hard to use just pads apparently you can get it still anyways. I dont want to not shave or anything anytime around my period. I got it today and I dont know what to do i feel like im randomly just gonna get this disease. ,Anxiety

34003,Uneven pupils on Friday I was looking in the mirror and noticed that my left pupil is much larger than my right. The vision in that eye is also blurry. I visited an optometrist today who dilated my eyes and confirmed that the left is more dilated than my right but he didn't know why. He assumed that its something I've always had but only noticed now but that's impossible because for the past year I have been obsessively checking my pupils in the mirror to make sure i haven't had a stroke hello health anxiety. a few days before the uneven pupils I woke up with a painful pulled muscle on the left side of my neck could that be related? I also have occasional tinnitus in the left ear usually pulsatile rushing noise. I'm afraid its either a carotid dissectionstroke or some sort of tumor. Maybe I had a seizure in my sleep that cause the pulled neck muscle and the eye issue? Anyway I just wanted to vent and see if anyone else has had weird eye issues or fears. Its tough to have all these thoughts in my head without anyone listening or taking them seriously. ,Anxiety

34005,I feel really silly posting this but... I think Ill feel better if I get this off my chest. I definitely have some health anxiety although its not as bad as it could be. I recognize that many of the symptoms I feel from time to time are a result of internalizing stress and are made worse by worrying about them and I think Ive gotten a better handle on it as the years have gone by.But I dont think anxiety can cause lumps or make them grow and Im trying to stay away from Google and redirect my focus but Im still feeling that worry and wanting to check on the lump every five minutes. I think Ive done a fairly good job keeping myself in check and only examining the lump once a day. But Im going to write this out and see if it helps. Maybe someone else has had a similar story and everything turned out fine? I want to hear it if so.Close to a year ago now I noticed this lump under my arm. I thought it was an ingrown hair. Mentioned it at a checkup the doctor felt it and thought it was a lymph node. She offered to do an ultrasound but I was getting ready to move out of state and didnt have time. The lump grew and became really painful and red. For reasons I didnt see a doctor until about eight months later when they diagnosed the lump as an abscess next to a swollen lymph node. Abscess was drained tested positive for Staph I got a gross course of antibiotics and that was that. The lymph node shrank a little after that and I could still feel a lump where the abscess was. Primary care doctor said it was a cyst that had formed form the abscess being left alone for so long and sent me to a surgeon to have it removed. The surgeon was not very nice told me he couldnt feel anything and sent me home. Eventually the cyst shrank and I couldnt feel it anymore. Fast forward to two months later and now...the original lymph node has shrunk but its still around. And now above it theres a new...mass. Its next to where the abscess was before but off to the outside top corner of my armpit sorry for the bad explanation. Its a hard lump and fixed in place which freaks me out a bit because google says thats a sign of cancer. Buuuuuut maybe its just my muscle Im feeling. The other armpit has a bit of that bump thing going on at the top but its way less pronounced and feels less like a defined lump if that makes sense. And it feels like its growing. Thanks to the abscess I have a scar and it feels like the lump is noticeably getting closer to the scar. I feel like such a drama queen. Im so embarrassed bringing stuff like this up at the doctor because Im so used to being dismissed and them thinking Im a huge baby. I just feel ashamed of being like this. Being stuck between worry or embarrassment isnt much of a choice. But this nagging voice in my head keeps saying anxiety cant cause a lump like it could cause a headache or nausea or heartburn or whatever. I just cant cope with the humiliation if it turns out being nothing and they think Im an idiot. I have an appointment with my doctor for something unrelated and not to do with something being wrong with me and Im debating on if I should bring it up. My doctor now seems really good and nonjudgy these feelings are internalized. If someone else has had a mysterious bump that vanished one day and ended up being nothing please let me know. Thanks ,Anxiety

The aching seems to pop up in different spotsleft right under the jaw mid neck collarbone area at random times. Today I was feeling around my neck and noticed my right lymph node was very swollen and the left side I couldn't even feel.

34007,Im 19 yo and my hair is thinning and more worrying symptoms I first noticed my hair thinning two months ago. I've always had thick hair that would grow pretty quickly. Now my hair's gotten thin and quite dry. The thinning is more extreme on the sides of my head with visible patches at the top there arent any such patches but still thinning and dryness. I impulsebought biotin tablets to help with the thinning but im hesistant to take them at the moment since nothing's been diagosed yet.But it's not just the hair. I have also been getting although not frequent a tingling sensation in my right fingers and sometimes on a whole hand at times. More recently say the last week or so my vision's gotten blurry. I don't know if the blurred vision is permanent and i've just gotten use to it or not but ive definitely had these phases. Ive looked up my 'symptoms' and what's come up are thyroid conditions B12 deficiencies and a whole load more. With B12 deficiency in particular its symptoms seem to align with mine pretty closely. Other than my symptoms ive mentioned already B12 deficiency symptoms include 'tiredness' and 'memory loss' i feel like i have these or atleast they're more pronounced recently ive always been fairly forgetful.Im genuinely worried if i have some serious conditon. Ive booked an appointment with my doctor and hopefully i can get however many of these symptoms i actually have sorted. Sorry for this being so long winded. Stay healthy friends.,Anxiety

I brushed it off and was able to ignore it however normally if it is nothing or I am having motion sickness it dies down after a while. It did not. I began feeling REALLY nauseous and just plain weird. I was also having a lot of small burps and...gas down there. So then I thought must be gas as this has happened before. 3 hours go by and I literally cannot move or I feel like I am going to throw up. We go to his moms house and I try to lay down and sleep. And then I got that feeling maybe 30 minutes later went to the bathroom and puked up all of my food. I have never puked so much in my life. It hurt really bad and to make it worse every 30mins1hr after that I threw up 8 more times as you can imagine I got ZERO sleep. It has now been about 5 hours since I threw up and I feel absolutely fine. My stomach does feel a little raw as expected. But I am able to sip gatorade and suck on ice chips right now with zero desire to eat. This is where things get nastier about 20 minutes ago I was laying here kind of sitting up and I felt gas down there so I obviously decided to let it out. Worst mistake because I SUDDENLY FELT IT WAS WET DOWN THERE. And boy was it.I ran full speed to the restroom and it turns out to be what appeared as a mixture of super watery diarrhea and vomit. Absolutely disgusting I showered and here I am now. hours ago before the last few times I puked I did have to poop it was weird it came out of nowhere and I went and it was big and soft. And then this!What makes my boyfriends mom suspect it is the stomach flu is because my boyfriends sisters boyfriend threw up the other night too however she didnt get sick I was nowhere near him and he had a concussion. I dont have a fever either atleast I dont think I do?I feel like food poisoning is the culprit because I have had it before and this same thing happened besides the bathroom situation from what I remember. Just constant throwing up over and over again. I did eat a lot of lettuce and spinach so I hope it isnt ecoli.Any advice would be appreciated. ,Anxiety

34011,the HA just won't quit... So long time lurker and first time poster. Just have to say how helpful this subreddit is for calming me down during a heath anxiety meltdown!Background My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer about 7 years ago went into remission was rediagnosed with stage four bc a year and a half ago and passed away about six months ago it had spread to her brain. I'm 23 female and she did not carry any of the BRCA genes.Around 5 years ago I felt a small bump in my armpit while doing a selfexam and went into a full blown panic. After about a month of constantly poking and prodding and googling symptoms I forgot about it and the next time I checked it had disappeared. I noticed it again a year later and had a physical around that time and asked my doctor. She said that it was fine and nothing to worry about can't remember if she said lymph node or cyst...I was just so excited I was not dyingFast forward to six months ago when my mother passed away and I became hyperaware of anything breastrelated. The small lump is currently present. It's come and gone a number of times since I first noticed it years ago it's always in the exact same spot lasts for various amounts of time it's 'biggest' size has never changed and when it's 'gone' I can kind of feel a little remnant. It's under the skin not hard but not exactly soft either can move around but tends to move with the skin it's directly under. Sometimes when I get poking at it for days on end it hurts a little bit and the skin gets irritated. My aunt has suffered from cysts most of her life and has gotten a lot in her armpits and my stepmother who is a nurse has told me that I'm fine.Basically I know it's not cancer most of the signs point to the fact it's not but Google of course tells me that I'm dying of a million different cancers mostly lymphoma or metastatic breast cancer. I have an annual exam in around a month and I'm going to ask about it for the peace of mind but I just can't stop worrying about it. Any tips? It's just so frustrating to know I'm being completely ridiculous but it's like I have no control over it.,Anxiety
34012,Finally letting go of my HIV anxiety Today I took an hiv test a year from exposure. After a year of stress anxiety worries etc I am finally letting go. My result was negative. After a year of testing I can truly say I am negative. I just want to thank everyone for your help and reassuaring words. Jbee a special thank you to you as well. During this year I lost who I was. I am usually a vivacious person but turned into an anxious scrooge. Some of my interests and hobbies seemed no longer interesting. Now I am going to live full out! 2018 I'm ready for you!!! ,Anxiety
34013,Convinced myself I have Celiac disease? I've been lactose intolerant since I was 20 and got diagosed with GERD as a child. However I just recently did a dumb thing and looked up symptoms of celiac disease and am rationalizing going to the doctor and getting tested.No one else in my family even extended has had lactose or acid problems. Eating gluten with celiacs long term can cause those problems. I've always been underweight 5'11 130 lbs. Im also always tired though I think my iron levels are fine and I cleared a thyroid test a few years ago. When I have more than 3 drinks in a night I have severe vomiting the next day to the point I've gone to the ER because it had been every hour for 8ish hours.For someone this anxious about it you'd think I'd track these things better. But now I'm locked into a very shitty vegetarian diet at work chockfull of products with gluten for the next 5 months. Would I be justified in going to the doctor just to lay all this out there and see if its related maybe to celiac? Or am I just being paranoid?,Anxiety
34014,Afraid i've been exposed to hantavirus really panicking So I'm on Vacation in a friends cabin a couple miles north of Lake Tahoe CA. It was freezing last night so I went to the closet to grab an old comforter to add to my bed. What I had forgotten is that there is a mouse problem in this house. I woke up this morning and found a couple mouse droppings in my bed. I googled if that could be dangerous and panic ensued. I've googled the cases hantavirus reported in California and many of them focus around the area I'm in. There was also a case near Reno really close to here just last fall. There's mouse droppings littered in the carpet of this house one here one there and now I've slept with a blanket that had them in it. We're only here for 2 nights total so we didn't clean the place. I'm so scared for myself and my family. I hate being anxious like this because it feels like I KNOW i have it like I'm already in the hospital dying. What do you think the likelihood I've been exposed is?,Anxiety

34016,Do I have Anxiety or Schizophrenia? 18 Male 5'8 Caucasian no previous diagnosed medical conditions or medications but I think I have Social Anxiety and mild GAD. No relatives that I know of with schizophrenia however my dad is adopted so I can't know for sureI KNOW only a psychiatristgp can diagnose me properly. I am asking here to see if it's worth to do so.For maybe half a year now I've had constant anxiety of having schizophrenia. It started with me being in school walking through the corridor and hearing my name being called even though I know I probably just misheard someone else talking. I went home and googled schiz symptoms and since then have been constantly worrying about it..Other symptoms Music playing in my head. Can be hard to make it stop. Sometimes when Ive smoked weed it feels literally impossible to make it stop.Constantly repeating conversations in my head or preparing for future ones. Also it feels like most of my thoughts are thought of as if im in a conversation if you understand what I mean by that.Auditory hallucinations ? Heard my name being called a couple of separate times when walking around town amp in school. However one time at a night club it happened like 58 times in one night was quite drunk amp anxious the dayevening before. It's NOT in a distinct voice its just someone else next to me who's talking about something completely different and my brain just misfires and I hear my name instead.. Also Idk if it counts as hypnagogic hallucinations but when I meditate I a random word or sentance can pop up in my head but it can be in a different voice than my own inner monologue often someone i know. However it really doesn NOT feel like a voice talking to me more like intrusive thoughts that are in the voice of someone else but im the one thinking? its not loud or anythingQuite often several times a day when seeing some random person on the street I recognize someone I know for a split second then I realize it wasn't them. Saw some interview with a dude with schiz who said this was one of his first symptoms but with carsPoor control of my inner monologue. I tend to overanalyze every single thought that I have. Because of this I have somehow caught the habit of thinking Would someone with schizophrenia do this or does this mean I have schizophrenia?Seeing things out of the corner of my eye.Slight sensation that people in school might be talking shit about me however like 2 seconds after that happens I realize how ridiculous it isI have smoked quite a lot of weed the last 2.5 years but lately have not been smoking much at all. It tends to make my anxiety worse and hyperactive the last time I smoked when i was walking home i was paranoid about anyone looking at me through windows and when I walked past 2 guys I was convinced they were talking about me.No delusions paranoia when sober depersonalization social life is good etc. I feel ''sane'' but can not stop having thoughts of schizophrenia.What do you guys think? I posted a similar post in raskdocs and rschizophrenia and most of them said I'm fine but I'm still extremely scared.,Anxiety

Tried to convince myself it was fine made the whole avocado toast and when it came time to eat it...I was too scared of being poisonedgetting sick or something I mean can that even happen?? that I scrapped off all the avocado and now I'm sitting here with my plate full of damn avocado that I know was most likely perfectly fine to eat lolThought we could all use a laugh or something ,Anxiety
34019,HA for two weeks just discovered what its like Hi allSo the last two weeks have been a ride for me. I've always had a buildup of wax in my left ear runs in the family. A few weeks ago I noticed a ringing noise in my left ear. I went to the doctor and they said it was an ear infection. So I started taking antibios ... didnt go away. So today I went to an ENT who suctioned out my ears and gave me stronger antibiotics and reaffirmed me that this is most definitely a temporary phenomenon and will go away in time 1 week 1 hour 1 month ... he said ears take awhile to heal. I had this confirmed by many of my friends that experienced ear infections as well. The ringing will go away just in time.The problem is... throughout the past several days I spent the majority of my time convincing myself that I had some sort of major illness. The first concern was cancer then that turned into a meningiti then that turned into inner ear concerns then that turned into HIV concerns ...I don't know how I arrived at any of these conclusions. I had no symptoms of any of these illnesses yet I immediately assumed that I had them. No way do I have meningitis I would know by now ... no way do I have cancer it doesnt really run in my family nor do I display any other symptoms. No way do I have aids ... I have not exposed myself in any way that would put me into a situation where it was possible. My friends and peers are all convinced I have anxiety issues and need to see a counselor. I went to one last week and she pretty much confirmed that I have anxiety issues that are beginning to manifest themselves in a moderate form of hypochondria. I literally started checking myself every day for things .... lumps rashes bruises .... I write because I'm curious to know other people's stories. How do you cope with this? This constant anxietydriven fear of having a major disease. I've spent so much time over my break from school researching illnesses conditions symptoms ... trying to connect the dots from anything I could have possibly been exposed to in the past. The slightest itch would terrify me. An ingrown hair on my beltline convinced me I had an STD. In effect I didn't actually live the past week. My worrying sapped away from my actual living. Sorry for the long drawn out rant. ,Anxiety
34020,Having a horrible HA week. This week my HA has just went flying back off the rails. It started with the usual heart palpitations thinking im on the verge of cardiac arrest. Then i had a day of thinking i was gonna die of sepsis for literally no reason at all. Like i didnt even have an injury. I keep washing my hands too much. Cleaning the absolute shit out of my house. And as of yesterday my head has settled back on the good ole fear of getting Rhabdomyolysis from powerlifting. Because i think i overdid training yesterday. I had a back injury that kept me from doing specifically squats for like almost a year. So i have been afraid to do them. Deadlift and bench are fine and i go heavy. But i have really only been doing squats on the high volume speed work day. I was doing pause squats with only 1 plate per side on the bar. Its way too light and i have been afraid to go heavier. So yesterday i decided to do box squats 10 sets of 2 with 30 sec rest. With 1 plate and one chain per side. For resistance. It felt easy and i completed it and went on to do the rest of the exercises per usual. But then it sudden hit me that i did more weight with high volume than im used to on that particular exercise. I do more than double that weight on deadlift but still thats not the same. And ill probably get rhabdo. Later on in the evening i felt nauseous and i think i have some pain in my quads. No other symptoms. But i read you could have it and have NO SYMPTOMS WTF. Idk if the nausea and migraine i got was from the major anxiety from the rest of the week leading up to this or from rhabdo. Im really trying to not do the whole panic and go to the ER thing that i always do when i get like this. Im ruining my sleep schedule that i worked really hard to fix i have insomnia from ptsd and i didnt want to sleep until i knew i didnt have it. Im still panicking over it today. And as soon as i get anxiety the nausea comes back and i think about the minor soreness in my quads and how its going to kill me or make me very sick for a long time and ruin everything. Its fucking awful. ,Anxiety
34021,Fucking amoeba again I'm in Egypt and while taking a shower I managed to inhale a small droplet of water up my nose. I didn't feel it but I'm sure it went up there because I sniffed very hard and the ends of my hair beaded with water droplets were dangling right in front of my nostrils. I looked it up why did I do that and apparently the tap water here is full of that fucking amoeba that eats your brains. Now I've got the 15 day incubation period to endure knowing that every twinge in my head could signal my doom. Fuck my life.Worst of it is one of the first symptoms of the amoeba is alterations to taste or smell... I have a cold... which also causes that. And can cause headaches too. And sometimes even fever.

34024,Crippling fear Hey guys Im posting this because I want to see if Im the only one. My grandma passed on her hypochondria to me and ever since I suffered a spinal injury my sophomore year of highschool Ive been terrified of doctors visits and every little pain ache tingle and spasm I get in my body. I went to a sports specialist for my back and he diagnosed me with a C5 fracture and scoliosis. I can live with that. But after I became aware that my body is injured and no longer the same Ive been obsessed with the idea that I have cancer a brain tumor or MS. Usually its cancer that takes over my thoughts.My thing is I avoid the doctors office in every way possible. I HATE the idea of going to the doctor being diagnosed because to me my life is over at that point. I can usually talk myself through my panic episodes but I usually seek the reassurance of others. I have a mole on my back and Im convinced its changing so every other week I ask my girlfriend if its changed and she says of course not. I cant remember what it looked like as a kid but I couldve sworn it didnt look like it does now. My anxiety is so bad I went to the doctor when I had a flu that wouldnt go away got chest xrays to rule out pneumonia and before my doctor told me the results I told him look if I have cancer I dont want to know just dont tell me and he looked at me like I was crazy because the Xray came back perfectly fine just a common flu.Ive avoided the doctors office for so long now that I feel like there HAS to be something wrong. Terminal. I know I should go but even thinking about the idea makes me shutter with fear. A lot of the posts I read on here are about people that go to the doctor too much but I wanted to see if there were people out there that are like me.,Anxiety

34026,IBSpsoriasis My story and never would have thought what was causing it!! I want to share my story because I believe theres a lot people out there in my situation. When I was younger in high school I would get diarrhea going to class mostly happened in the morning. This was around the year 1999. I had psoriasis on my head for most of my life. It would get bad from time to time but never went away. The doctor would prescribe an ointment that stunk like gasoline. I would put this on head and it felt like it was burning the skin off my skull. So I never really used it just suffered as is. Now back to the diarrhea issue. I went to the doctors and they did everything you could imagine. Blood tests stool tests upper and lower GIs and the good old colonoscopy! In the end the doctor said that I was a healthy young man. So he diagnosed me with IBS.Once I graduated from high school it seem to simmer down to where I never really had any more symptoms. So I figured that is was over. Years passed by and once in a blue moon the IBS would come back. But the psoriasis never went away. I moved forward in my career and in my personal life. I thought that the nightmare I had when I was younger would never comeback. Boy I was wrong! One day at work after having something for lunch my captain and I had just taken off we were in the air for all of ten minutes. I looked at him and said we have to go back and land! He asked what was wrong I replied that Im going to crap my pants. So we turned the plane around and landed without incident. The next day my manager called and asked what had happened and I replied that I must have ate something I shouldnt have. Months rolled by with no farther problems other then the psoriasis. I upgraded to captain and loved what I was doing. Then one day it came back only this time it didnt go away!! Much worse I started taking Imodium gel caps one before the flight and as prescribed as many as I need during the flight.this was a bad idea for me but we will come back to thisSo off to the doctor I went and of course started to do familiar tests. Only this time after all the testing the doctor didnt just say it was IBS but it also must be in my head. Now its time to send me to a shrink. There I am off work by this point sitting on a couch playing head games at the same time trying not to mess myself. After the third session I said its not in my head no way!!!My wife is going crazy by this point with me not working so off I went with the same problems back to work. The first day I tried to do one flight. Had diarrhea threes times and kept taking Imodium trying to fight it. I didnt even get the engine started. I went back off work. Then my wife said your going to do whatever I tell you to do now! I was game because I just wanted this to be over. She sent me to a naturalpath doctor I thought that this was going to be a joke but played along as Im willing to do whatever by this point. This ended up being a game changer for me. I told her what was happening and she said tell me what you eat I the run of a day. I told her and she replied that it sounds like a FOOD INTOLERANCE and that its a simple blood test. I said that I already been tested she replied thats for allergies. I agreed to the test. About three weeks later she calls me say the results are in. I went to see her she said I had three different intolerances one was potatoes another was cane sugar with fruit and the last most important....soy. That day I eliminated all three and within a week all my symptoms were gone including my psoriasis even the little bumps on the back of my arms went away!!I was so happy the only problem now is that I have to prepare all my meals and read every label of anything I want to eat. So living on the road as an airline pilot makes it tough but Ive got it down now.Soy is what was causing all my problems and if I have it today it comes back at full fold. Now remember how I said I was taking Imodium GEL caps well one of the ingredients is SOY. Just like a car jamming on the brakes while hitting the gas!!So I had medical problems that regular doctors couldnt find went to a naturalpathic doctor and found out that I have a food intolerance to Soy.,Anxiety
34027,HIV Anxiety About 3 weeks ago I was the insertive partner in unprotected anal sex with another guy. He claimed to be HIV and sent me test results from November proving so. However I'm still nervous. About 3 days after the encounter I developed something akin to strep throat this went away after 10 days possibly thanks to amoxicillin. Today I took an inhome HIV test that came back negative but apparently these are not guaranteed to be accurate until 3 months after the event. I'm incredibly worried that I have HIV after one mistake. Please help ,Anxiety
34028,Bump on the forehead I have noticed that there is a bump its bone though not actual bump as when you bump your head against something on one side of my forehead. I can definitely see it looking from the profile. I havent ever really spent ages investigating my forehead shape but Im pretty sure it wasnt there always however I couldnt tell how long its been present either. Years ago I had a pretty bad head injury in an accident but I was overall ok and havent really had any problems since so Im guessing its probably not directly related if there is anything... As of recent I have developed strange little symptoms eg. I feel like Im clumsierless well coordinated than before and my muscles on one side feel a bit strangeachy sometimes but these things arent very consistent and arent really getting worse theyre probably in my head and they do get better with vitamin B.I know I tend to be a bit hypochondriac and after that accident years ago I was understandably pretty paranoid about anything headrelated thats why Im hesitant to actually speak to a doctor in case they think Im crazy and I waste their time on nonsense. If theres anyone on here who knows a bit about the subject any doctors or med students maybe do you reckon it is worth checking out? ,Anxiety

The only bump is a small vertical line raised that isn't much longer than 34.

34034,Did the elliptical really mess me up like this? Hey everyone would love some input I've been getting odd chest sensations for a while now along with shoulder back and neck pains. I spoke to my doctor and he believes it's posture related. But lately this week the chest discomfort has become more pronounced. I went to the gym two days ago and while I was on the elliptical I started feeling this almost burning sensation in my chest. It subsided somewhat once I stopped. That same sensation has come and gone since and now I have a spot that's sore to the touch right over my sternum. I'm thinking it's reflux related especially since I'm on meds for that and I've been burping a lot but does anyone else have any insight?

34035,Second opinion for cancer? Hey there.I'm a 24 yo female and in early October 2017 I noticed a lump on the left side of my neck about the size of a pea. Assuming it was from a cold as I had been coughing quite a bit. I let it go until I noticed again in early November it had grown in size. I noticed another under my right jaw and my doctor ordered an ultrasound and the left one measured 1.88 cm x 0.92 cm x 0.98 cm and the right one measured 1.27cm x .76cm x 1.06cm. I had other swollen lymph nodes as well but this was the one I could feel from the outside.The ultrasound tech ordered another test through my GP although my GP was hesitant to sign the form for my follow up for early January so I went on the 2nd. The left lymph node is now 1.74cm x 1.03cm X1.0cm and the right lymph node is now 1.79cm x 0.91cm x 1.22cm.I've also found that my cough has gotten worse despite not having any other cold symptoms runny nose sneezing etc as well as I am finding myself very short of breath with a chronic pinchingsqueezing sensation below where my bra band sits. My doctor ordered a pulmonary function test and we are waiting for results. I find myself waking up in the middle of night really hot and sweaty and I have been getting an itchy rash on my stomach that comes and goes. When I mentioned this to my doctor she didn't think anything of it I thought I might be getting fevers at night from a bad flu or something.I'm a little worried because the lymph nodes mentioned as well as the other 8 or 9 notes in my ultrasound have seem to have grown in some way or another and I'm hoping my doctor doesn't dismiss it like she did the last time. Would you reccomend a second opinion? Seeing if the lymph nodes grow more? I would love some peace of mind on this.,Anxiety

34037,Irrationally terrified of seizures I have spent today being irrationally terrified of having a seizure. I've never had a seizure before. I've seen my sister having a diabetic seizure but that's as close as I've gotten to experiencing one.My anxiety stems from the fact that people with retinal migraine are at a higher risk of experiencing seizures and strokes.Then there is this I was prescribed Wellbutrin last week to help with getting out of bed in the mornings coupled with venlaflaxine. My psych informed me that drinking alcohol can result in a seizure while on Wellbutrin. In addition so can combining Wellbutrin and aspirinAdvil. He said Tylenol is OK and I checked online for any drug interactions too which confirmed that it should be OK. I have a cold today and an upset stomach so I took some Tylenol Cold amp Flu pills to relieve it.And then I spent the rest of my evening preoccupied by the idea of having a seizure because I took Tylenol. I even contemplated seriously telling my boss that I could have a seizure along with wanting to tell my coworker that if I am on the ground shaking uncontrollably that it is a seizure and to call an ambulance.Completely irrational I know. Some days are just worse than others I suppose.,Anxiety

I am going to be requesting a blood test on Monday due to some GI problems I have had since November which started when I started taking a daily multivitamin although have not been serious enough to warrant consulting a medical professional but not mild enough to be ignored completely. I am absolutely terrified they are going to turn around and say that I have a serious form of cancer or IBD there has not been any bleeding fatigue or fever though. I know it's an irrational fear because I frequently exercise 75 of my diet is healthy and I don't smoke drink or do drugs. However I still feel as though they are going to call me up and ask me to be at the hospital immediately. Reassurance would be appreciated! ,Anxiety
34042,Im a gay male hypochondriac so anxious about getting HIV. Its affecting my life and relationships. Why do I feel like this? I have always had some form of hypochondria and more recently it has overrun my life and relationships. I am deeply anxious all the time. Im not intimate because of fear even though Im in a monogamous relationship and Im very conscious of my surroundings. For example if Im walking and someone coughs near me I have to look the other way or turn around directions. If someone sneezes same thing. I have to get as far away from them. Also if I go out to eat i have to see food being prepared like sushi or salads in front of me if I notice something off like worker using no gloves or touched something differently I buy the salad and struggle to eat it after inspecting it for blood or bodily fluid many times. I feel like my body is contaminated or some disease is brewing inside me all the time even though my latest blood work last August was all negative. Im a habitual hand washer and sanitizer and I use alcohol to sanitize my razors toothbrushes before every use. I know HIV is very hard to get but over the past couple years i have been tested over 100 times including majority over the counter HIV test for 40 each. This is crippling me and I want to resolve this fear. ,Anxiety
34043,I fear I was bitten by a bat or something HelloI just need to get this off my chest. It am always worried about something with my health.About a week I was walking in my backyard. It was really cold in PA like below freezing. I had a coat and jeans on. When I was walking back I felt something near my knee. I didn't think anything of it. but I get random feelings all the time but nothing is ever there. But then a day later I found this and I am concerned. It doesn't itch or painful and its gone now. But for some reason I think it is a bite from something. My parents think I am crazy.It has since healed. httpsimgur.comaEMPVa ,Anxiety
34044,Blood??? in Stool Alright so this is an issue Ive had on and off for years and I dont know what to do. So basically sometimes I have red spots in my stool. I say spots because it doesnt fill the whole bowl the whole stool isnt red just red spots. It also appears on my toilet paper time to time. Im 21 now and the first time anything happened was probably 5 years ago. Doctor did an occult test found nothing but a hemroid sent me on my way with a cream and I was fine for a while. Its happened on and off since then and usually I either know its hemroids or I can trace it back to something red I ate. Recently however its gotten worse. About a month ago as my semester was ending there was about a week where I had stomach pains and twice in that week my stool had these red spots. I went to a local walk in clinic and had another occult test done and it also came back nevative. The doctor said it was probably something I ate. Ive been fine this past month but I just flew back from Europe and twice in the past 3 days Ive noticed the same red spots. Now each time it happened I had a red fruity drink the day before so I still dont really think its blood but if thats the case wouldnt it appear as a liquid in the bowl and not a spot as Ive described. Part of me wants to go to the doctor but I was just verified a month ago that it wasnt blood and I feel going again will just lead to the same result. Im just wondering is it normal to have any redness in your stool once in a while from food and Im just overly vigilante as health anxiety definitely has made me or is there more to it.

34045,Scary throat problems I had 2 respiratory infections in about a span of a month and when it finally began to clear up I had an persistent globule feeling in the opening of my throat. After about a week later that two passed and I began to have pain in the right side of my chest usually after eating. Most recently I've been having this electric shock feeling in the opening of my throat when I yawn or sometimes just stretch my neck. I feel like it maybe happened occasionally over the last couple weeks but I feel like the frequency and intensity is increasing with time. Someone please help.,Anxiety

Moved out of a house filled with mold.Been prescribed two diff antibiotics before tests showed nothing.Started feeling slightly better but was around a ton of cigarette smoke.It's like every other night I feel awful.

34047,Cant tell if panic attack or allergic reaction. Please help. So I have what I think is the common cold and decided to take Mucinex DM. After I took it I noticed there werent any effects listed on the package at all so I looked it up online. Well it says the most severe side effect is chest tightnessdifficulty breathing. I was kinda already having chest tightness before I looked that up. Reading that made it even worse. The reason I cant tell if its panic or not is because I started getting bad anxiety after reading about the flu epidemic and how it caused death and stuff. This was all after taking it. This is also my first time ever taking Mucinex DM. Everything is just making my feelings worse and I dont know what to do. My main anxietypanic symptoms are chest tightness short breaths and nausea. It said on the website to go to the ER but Im too scared to and cant afford it at all. Im also worried its just my anxiety and that Ill end up going for no reason. ,Anxiety

34049,I feel like Im going crazy. This all started after the death of a loved one. It was sudden but not health related. Ever since then I analyze every single thing I do and how it could impact me. Im always worried about my liver failing or something like that because I drink. Im not an alcoholic by any means at most Ill have 4 drinks maybe twice a week. Im 21 so thats kind of the norm in college but I still worry. A lot of my health anxiety is about other people as well. I constantly worry that my boyfriend is going to die for example. I know its so stupid and that Im fine but the worrying overtakes me. I know this started after the sudden death of a loved one. But at this point I cant control it and worrying is taking over my life. Thanks for reading this ,Anxiety
34050,Health Anxiety is ruining my life. So it all started getting worse when about three weeks ago I accidentally got hit in the forehead with a soft car seat... I wasn't knocked out or anything A amp E said I had no serious injuries no bruise etc. My Health Anxiety's like Well how do you know you're fine you should see a doctor again so that nothing new has come up.I go to the doctor I phone two different doctors and they tell me I don't have any signs of a serious head injury... I end up freaking out a few days later because of persistent headaches and feeling spaced out so I go to the A amp E again a different doctor gives me a neurological examination and tells me I don't have any serious injuries and should be more concerned about my anxiety. Then out of nowhere one of my relatives has a heart attack and is in hospital he's fine and well now and I start to worry. A few days after visiting him I'm at my boyfriend's house and lying in bed... I'm getting these headaches that have lasted about a week now as well as a sudden pain in my arm and chest and become totally convinced that I'm having a heart attack or a stroke. It doesn't help that I was starving myself because I was so stressed out I had lost half a stone in the space of a week. I thought that I was dying because I hadn't eaten and was having heart problems because of this.So now my HA brain thinks I've had a stroke twice without noticing or being diagnosed and that I have a damaged brain and that I also might have a brain tumour.I've not been able to smell or taste things as well since I got a minor bump on the forehead but it's quite possibly the case that my anxiety is convincing me I have these symptoms... so I've remained in this constant heightened state of numbness because of my anxiety believing that I have some sort of serious condition... I was even at an audiologist because I believed that a visit to the cinema had permanently damaged my hearing everything was fine and he said I had no hearing damage...I go to the doctor again because of my severe anxiety she tells me that all of my symptoms headaches ringing in ears loss of sense of smell are being caused by my anxiety. She prescribes me with propranolol... naturally I look up the side effects and become terrified to take the medication.Just today I started getting a headache and was convinced I was taking a stroke again. I've became kind of emotionally numb now because I'm constantly ruminating about what could be wrong with me healthwise. I can't even enjoy things anymore because my HA goes Well maybe you can't enjoy that or feel much emotions or think about that the same way as you did before because you have brain damage caused by an undiagnosed TBI or a stroke. I can't pay attention to things.It doesn't matter what the doctors say after a few hours I'm always convinced that they're wrong and that there's a serious problem with my brain and they haven't been able to find it yet.I'm so sick of this. Can anyone else relate?How do you convince yourself that there's nothing seriously wrong with you? ,Anxiety
34051,2 years of relentless HIV anxiety please read and KEEP CALM For the last couple of years I have been utterly petrified of HIV. I'd say it has crossed my mind at least once an hour for the last 2 years and 4 months. Statistically the chances of me having it were alwaysridiculously small and none of the science would support the hypothesis that I had contracted HIV.But some brains work in funny ways. And mine is an example of a brain that immediately believes the worst possible outcome. And I'm sure there are many many many more out there who have wrapped themselves in a similar web of selfloathing and utter panic. The advent of Dr Google is good but it can also do some terrible things for our mental health.The solution the whole time was simple test. Test and set yourself free. It's hugely important on so many levels to know your HIV status. For your own health for your sexual partner's health. For the sake of the NHS. I am so glad I got tested. I can literally feel a part of my brain resuming activity. It feels strange not carrying around the fear I had been carrying before it has literally given me a headache as my brain tries to decide how to reallocate this space.I had ALL the symptoms. Absolutely text book seroconversion illness. Fever sore throat swollen glands night sweats stomach discomfort everything. Doctor's presumed it was glandular fever but tests never confirmed the presence of the EBV which it should for glandular fever. Classic ARS. Of course after a couple of weeks I was back on my feet again and the doctor was quite content.Then about a year after this I came out in a weird rash that wouldn't go away for like 2 weeks. Seemed like some sort of bacterial infection to me. And it always got worse in the sun. OBVIOUSLY my immune system was compromised.From the moment of my glandular fever my brain had convinced myself I was carrying HIV. But I wasn't brave enough to test. I was being cowardly. However over the last few months I've been having some stomach issues which are pretty nonspecific and the internet didn't really help me link it to HIV. The doctor did suggest a CBC test for me though I think just to get an idea if anything was going on bloodwise obviously lol. I was told by the nurse who carried out the blood test that it was very much a case of no news is good news.Of course having had the blood test on Monday first thing on Tuesday I got a call from the doctor. My white blood cell count was low and she wanted me to come in so she could feel my lymph nodes. AHHHHH! My brain went in to overdrive. I couldn't cope. This was it. My worst fears realised. Why me? Why me?!! That's exactly what HIV does it attacks white blood cells. Nooooo!I went in for the doctor's appointment and she said all my lymph nodes were normally and no cause for concern.She did then say I would like to test you for HIV. My world was crumbling inwards. I couldn't believe that this was happening to me a very conservative early twentys heterosexual male. I looked at the statistics to such a deep level that I knew that in my country of residence there was only 32 males aged 1524 who were HIV positive. That's essentially like 0 of the population. I was about to become a medical phenomenon.The doctor eventually decided just to take the CBC again in 6 weeks time and that we wouldn't test for HIV just yet as I kind of freaked out when she suggested the HIV test. But the time was now I needed to know. I would have no quality of life with this intense level of anxiety coursing through every fibre of my being every second of the day. I had a second job interview for a pretty plush job that day and I totally flunked it due to the unbearable mental tension I felt.I did manage to summon the courage to order a HIV home test kit which I had delivered to my family home where I would have the test in the presence of my family so that I could receive immediate support from those closest to me when the test returned a positive result and in my head it was very much of WHEN not IF. I spoke to them on the day the doctor said about my low WBC and they were all wonderfully supportive did have to speak to my Mum about my sexlife though not ideal.So I went home yesterday and I had the test. And of course it was a big fat NEGATIVE. Which it always has been. It was a crucifying 15 minutes waiting for the test to work but during those 15 minutes on a deep level I felt a sense of peace. The band aid had been ripped off and life was going to move on.HIV is the worst for health anxiety as almost everything can be linked back to it. The anxiety can make your brain question everything I was even questioning my ability to swallow at one point. But the chances are going off the plethora of statistics out there you don't have it whoever you are who is out there searching for every piece of HIV research ever which has been me for the last two years. But still if the anxiety is as stressful and overbearing as what I was experiencing you need to get tested. Now. Somehow. Make it happen.I took the time to write this in the hope that someone who is currently going through a similar thing to what I went through can find solace in it. You will be alright regardless. You are a good person. But you need to put your mind to rest. You need to have the test. 'Thinking Fast and Slow' by Daniel Kahneman teaches a brilliant lesson in terms of this. Our brains are desperate to come up with a story that will justify our irrational way of thinkingcatastrophising. But numbers matter. Statistics speak volumes. You are not special. You are overwhelmingly likely to be normal. You aren't the 1 in 100000 shot. You are the 99999 out of 100000 shot. Our brains struggle to compute the true values of these numbers but we must try. Peace!,Anxiety
34052,Convinced I'm dying. First post in here very nervous so it'll be long winded.On Monday I had pain under my armpit and across my chest on the left side. I convinced myself I had everything from breast cancer to heart failure. Went to the doctor on Thursday and she diagnosed me with shingles. My rash is more like a cluster of spots and it's not itchy or have any of the other symptoms.Since then I've convinced myself my organs are failing and that I have a blood clot.The latest is breast cancer. Was in the shower and noticed a small about an inch long patch of skin that's red. No itch no rash spot or lumps. It's not hot to touch. It's just red skin. The thing that's throwing me is that it's on my right side whereas the shingles is on the left.I've alway suffered with anxiety but never health anxiety. I've just bought a house and I'm moving in on Friday I'm starting to think that because I'm not stressed about that I'm stressing about every single twinge in my body. For example I'm now extremely dizzy. It's a side effect of the anti vitals but I'm here writing a will.Somebody please tell me I'm not going crazy. ,Anxiety
34053,I'm scared It started with me checking randomly my neck and noticing a lymph node which if I recall correctly I have had for at least a year and another behind my ear which was there for years I went to two doctors and at different times and got told there was nothing to worry but I keep checking my neck basically everyday and keep finding others which I don't know if they were there before or not and my anxiety is getting worse and worse.My throat doesn't feel ok even though I got checked by three doctors. I feel like I have a bit of nausea and the other day I had a bit of fever which only lasted one night. Also my left ear from times to times feel obstructed which I've been told is due to my nasal septum deviation.And I could list a lot of other stuff that's wrong with me but that would get too long.A little over a month ago I had blood tests which didn't show anything wrong beside some vitamin but everyday I find a new symptom and I'm getting really scared right now. I keep thinking what if I took the tests too early what if...I don't know what to do anymore everyday something new pops up. I try to think about other stuff but eventually... I get back there.,Anxiety
34054,Eating less for 12 weeks and metabolism. I'm 18yo male. I lost my appetite couple weeks ago due to stress and mental problems I think I was forcing myself to eat enough calories per day which is around 2500 but now I can't do this anymore an apple can fill me up for many hours and sometimes I can't even think about eating more. I'm visiting my doctor in 12 days but before I will feel better I probably won't eat enough food and I'm afraid of my metabolism. Will this situation destroy it?,Anxiety
34055,I think School gave me social anxiety story is since I was born until I was 12 I was bullied no big deal because I am not traumatized and I am actually in good terms with my old classmates now but being bullied made me what people call a NEET I don't mind talking to people or going outside.... well I guess I do set some limits to myself when it comes to socializing to the point I am almost always quietI blame the school system at least on my country because it's made in a way that even when I moved to the US it just isn't easy to socialize with others because you have to be quiet or talk low this also gave me troubles with talking low usually it's hard for me not to well I scream a lot when I watch videos I am kind of crazy xd but in my comfort zone only and well I spent most of my days on a pc watching videos and having funMy parents also just don't know how to take care of a child you see I got depression and maybe something else thanks to my dad he isn't abusive he does things for a good purpose but the way he does it made me hard to tolerate him the slightest thing even just saying a bad joke if it comes from him it would make me mad over the line and I don't want to feel like that but I can't avoid it I dunno why it's just how he made me. I also don't find anything to do outside my house and that's why I don't even ask to get out of there adding how overprotective my parents are and when I actually do want to they just don't let me I almost never go to my friends houses I had a friend who didn't care when I went but hey after 2 visits I couldn't anymore because of their paranoia and being overprotective I don't hate them for that not even mad I just dislike how few chances I have of doing stuff like thatI think I am forgetting something.... I don't know.... I am not diagnosed with social anxiety nor seen anyone to tell me I have that but I dunno my man I am trying to explain my story but it's so badly structured that I just want to get to the point I am a NEET and I am used to live on the internet just chatting with people through text messagesbut today I tried VRChat and I just.... couldn't talk I wanted to but I couldn't most of the times I just think my voice isn't right for my words and a lot of times I just don't know I can't maybe I feel insecure? I just wonder if there's a way to fix this.... I don't think it's deepI don't feel pretty good now I was getting too bored in the game and I got tired of not doing a thing in VRChat my plan was to be a silent person and interact with people but it's hard without VR and it still gave me the chills to interact with them. I am frustrated because my voice... it isn't bad but I can't think of a avatar who would fit it my own appearance doesn't fit with my voice and even though I know many people have appearances that don't fit their voices my words my words are just what can't get out by just thinking how it will sound or saying it to listen to itThis is annoying I don't really hate my life I had fun when I was 10 and didn't have any friends just spent the whole time watching videos and playing game and I still had fun when I got friends on the internet or people to talk to ironically people ruined that fun a little bit xd at the price of making it more fun I am having fun now but now well I just handled depression I guess but talking to people is still something hard to do for me at least I got friends in my school but I am still just too quiet and I am annoyed by that I also find it almost impossible to start conversations or just impossible but without speaking.... meh it feels like there's no risk I dunno when I type I don't think I could mess up not because of my voice but it's still pretty hard but I think that's how it is usually hardI wanna add that my family aren't something I can call friends or people to talk to they have a lot of issues that are responsible for who I am now I also almost never talk to them specially when I just think there's nothing to talk about with most people actually but there's a fewer amount of topics with themAnd well that's my thing I just want to know if there's something I can do sorry for wasting your time this is a mess I don't normally make such a mess when I type stuff but this is one of the things I found the hardest to talk about not emotionally I usually make a mess when I find things hard to explain or to type but this one is just the worst xd oh wellat least I am not always like this there are times where I just have energy,Anxiety

It's maybe stupid but I'm now thinking that maybe I missed something and didn't understand that it wasn't to take at the same time the same week but one one week and the other the other week. Which wouldn't make any sense imo but I'm still wondering nonetheless.What do you guys think ? and btw english isn't my first language but I hope you understood everything,Anxiety

34059,Stain on neck I noticed something on my neck about a month ago. It looks like a pimple what seemed to be a yellow bruise down below it. I then forgot about it because I then started worrying if I had colon cancer because my stomach would make noises non stop. After my stomach issues cleared up by themselves I noticed my neck and the stain got darker and a bit bigger. For the past week or so Ive been constantly looking up melanoma and now I feel like I have it. Ive been obsessing taking 50 pictures a day of my neck crying it able to eat properly feeling like Im going to faint shaking and not being able to be happy with my wife and daughter. I spoke to a virtual doctor and said I should get tested to see if it is melanoma and Ive been crying and worrying all day. I feel like Im going insane and the thoughts of suicide have crossed my mind at least once because the thought of leaving my wife and daughter behind and the fact that Im only 26 scares me so much. I want to grow old with my wife and thinking that I might die so scares me so much. Im going to an actual doctor tomorrow and I cant handle it. I dont know how Im going to be like at work. I constantly keep googling and once I start I cant stop. I feel like I have melanoma and its already to late because it might be advanced. Im scared and all I want to do is cry and not move. I just want to be in bed and hold my wife and have her tell me that Im going to be okay over and over again. I just needed to vent. ,Anxiety

The sensations I get aren't necessarily painful but they give me anxiety as I feel like something is wrong with my heart.

But obviously still have been anxious and checking in the mirror nonstop. I got a horrible stiff neck back in June and have had a kink in my neck since Im also a long distance walker 10miles 4X a week and have been told this can be because of hip stuff. I have had blood work and everything is fine.

34067,I'm really struggling I've suffered with Anxiety for about 56 years now however in the last year my health anxiety has gotten extremely bad. Everywhere hurts at different times or different days and I constantly think I'm going to die. Whether it be a pain in my chest or a rash on my arm or even if I find a bump one somewhere.About a year and a half ago I started saying 'touch wood' if I or anyone else said something worrying that might happen. Eg if I said 'I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack' followed by me saying 'touch wood' and then touching something wooden. It made me feel secure like it made it not true and it wouldn't happen once I said and touched it.However it then got extremely out of control to the point where any time I even thought about something happening to me I'd tap the side of my head twice for some reason this was my new 'touch wood instead of trying to find something actually wooden I still say it sometimes but if I only think of something terrible happening I won't say anything out loud but rather say it in my head and touch my temple twice. I know this sounds crazy weird but I literally can't go a day without doing it now. My health anxiety is so bad. I've been reading other posts and I relate to most of them which really stresses me out. I will always go to the worse case scenario and I can't stop. I'm constantly getting pains in my arm or numbness shortness of breath chest pains headaches shaking etc. I knowhope deep down its my anxiety but I can never calm myself down.To make it worse my boyfriend gets annoyed at me for 'constantly being sick' ie when I have headaches or even when I get a numb pain or something he usually tells me I'm over reacting which makes me more stressed and upset. Idk if this is even the right place to post and even posting it is making me super anxious. I just can't get a moment to relax. My whole life is revolving around my anxiety. Every single day I think of death and how this might be my last day etc.How do I stop this? I'm really losing my mind. ,Anxiety
34068,Where I'm now with depersonlizationderealization So its been 7 hard crushing months but im glad to say it's mainly over. However it wasent easy. If u haven't read about my subreddit about how to deal with depersonlization I highly recommend u check it out. If u r still dealing with derealization plz message me YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Trust me I'm the most paranoid kid I've been through hell and back with this. So near about OctoberNovember I thought about DP depersonlization less and less honeslty it's gotten so much better for me and i thank God for that. However I've not felt the same. Sometimes I feel like time is moving fast or that I'm in a simulation but that's just me being meeven my friend who has never taken weed or had DP is also thinking about these things. The good news is it does get better bad news is it takes time and motivation. I personally had to go to a psychiatrist about my problem however yall be fine without one. My thoughts took over me and i felt more depressed than depersonalised Don't get me wrong some days I thought I was dead like literally. For a solid 56 months or so I woke up everyday and it was the first thought on my mind it was shit I couldn't talk to my bro without thinking he and myself weren't real i honeslty felt suicidal. Then some day I just woke up and i didn't think about it don't know why just didnt. I learned to control my thoughts but not to block them out. It's like me saying QUICK DONT THINK ABOUT A DOG ON ICE boom bet u thought that fuckin magician I am. Anyway it's all about acknowledging your thoughts don't block them out or try to get rid of them however don't let them take over you. Say to yourself 'I know you're there I'm just not in the mood to talk right now' it's like a fly in the room the more you try get rid of it the worse you will exhaust yourself however if u see it u wait don't put your full attention on it and let it see it'self out. Overall time is a healer and depersonlization taught me a lot about life and i hope whatever stage you are at now it gets better. Stay cool and collective peace my dudes ,Anxiety
34069,Visual migraines? A few months ago I starving dehydrated anxious overworked uni student was sitting in my school before a class when suddenly this weird curvy shape appeared in my vision specifically in my left eye. Kinda like if you stare at a light too long and youre left with a retinal image for a bit except this was kinda flashing and obscured my vision. This weird episode lasted for about 30 mins and occurred again three weeks after that and again a week after that. Thanks to the internet and my mom who says she has a history of these in her past I self diagnosed myself with visual migraines which can present themselves with no pain as my episodes did. At the time I took this as a call from higher powers aka my brain? that I needed to get more sleep drink more water eat better etc. and I hadnt had an episode for two months.Well I just had another one of these episodes and although today happened to be a very bad eating day and I was super dehydrated Im starting to worry about these. What if I have a brain tumor? What if Im going blind? What if Im about to die? These are the questions pounding through my head right now. Any advice? Anyone have similar symptoms ever?,Anxiety
34070,Chest Hey guys i hope everyone is well! This weekend i had slight chest pain and difficulty breathing aswell as a stuffy blocked nose. It was after hours so my local GP doctors surgery was closed meaning the next best thing was the ER..i heard about this deadly flu going around and got my ass straight to the ER as soon as i started feeling this. They did heart monitoring and blood sample as well as a chest x ray and said everything was clear and that it must just be an infection. I was prescribed amoxicillin 500mg 4 a day spread out evenly. I feel better in the sense that my chest isnt as breathless and my nose isnt as stuffy and im generally perkier but the chest pain is still there and im worried about it. What if its fluid in my lung or pneumonia? Its just bizarre that my flulike symptoms have essentially gone in the past 40 hours after 2 days on antibiotics yet i still feel this uncomfortable worrying chest! Any advice? ,Anxiety

34072,Arm aches symptoms on one side of body Hey guys. I posted here before in mid December about having numbness and weakness on the right side of my body. I went home after finals week and my stress level dramatically decreased as I realized how well I did in my classes and I was able to decompress while at home. I went on a ski trip with my family in the middle of the break right after Christmas and I felt no symptoms at any time during that trip. I felt fantastic. As I came home and started to prepare to go back to school I started feeling anxious that I would fall down into the same anxiety rabbit hole again in the second semester and gradually the weakness and numbness started to come back. Now that Ive been back at school for 8 days and the anxiety has persisted albeit less severe Im still feeling tightness in the right side of my neck and in my right leg as well as weakness and numbness in my right limbs. The symptom that is scaring me though is that my right arm feels dead and I have aches in my shoulder and upper arm that really change in severity depending on the time and on what my arm is doing or where it is.I just feel so stupid about this. Its following the same trends as it did last semester and that all went away when I stopped stressing. Now Im stressing again but for some reason my mind doesnt want to attribute this to the stress and I keep worrying that its a horrible disease coming to claim my life. Anyone have any input on a situation like this?,Anxiety

Everyone here is sick with the flu and everyone here is wearing masks including me. I have no choice but to wait here with my mom but Im terrified with the thought of myself coming down with the flu.

34074,Abdominal discomfort and headaches. Crazy Anxious Im 30 male and overweight. I don't know how much of this is anxiety but I've had all sorts of weirdness in my abdomen for like a month. Cramping all over but mostly a spot of pressure below my left rib. Its like always there though its really minor painpressure. But just today I got some pain in my lower right abdomen. I've had GERD a while but its never been like this. Also what feels like a lump in my throat but I went for the CT and laryngoscopy and nothing there. on that For like 2 weeks I've had intermittent tension headaches and lightheadedness. Im scheduled to see the gastroenterologist in a week but I know how anxious I've been and have been considering going to the ER. Just would love some reassurance.Thanks,Anxiety
34075,Horrid smelling dollar bill smells like a dead animalrabies anxiety A little background of myself. I have a severe phobia of rabies ever since I was bitten by a dog two years ago. Now every little thing triggers my fear. Anyways today in the grocery store I received some money that smelled absolutely disgusting. The type of smell you smell from a rancid dead animal. Now I've convinced myself that someone came into contact with a dead rabid animal didn't wash their hands and smeared whatever gunk they picked up from the hypothetical animal onto the dollar bill that I touched. This is my most farfetched scenario yet but I've persuaded myself that this is what happened. I'm sick of living this way. This shit is debilitating and ruins every waking moment of my life. How the fuck do I stop thinking like this?,Anxiety
34076,Lymph node anxiety Hi guys long time lurker here. For about the past 6 months Ive had my health anxiety under control or at least I accepted the anxiety as it was. I just got back from a vacation and for some reason my lymph nodes under my jaw are swollen. Im rather thin and theyre not terribly noticeable but if I feel around its maybe a little smaller than the size of my thumb. Ive just been freaking out a bit even though I know that I got tons of mosquito bites which can make lymph nodes noticeable on my trip and I was on a plane with a bunch of sick people. I just wanted to post so that I didnt keep this in my head. I guess Ill just roll with it and if they dont go down in a few weeks Ill get them checked out. Thanks for letting me vent.,Anxiety
34077,My Health Anxiety Story and How I am Recovering Hello rHealthAnxiety!Allow me to tell you my health anxiety story and how I am beginning to recover from this psychological illness!The first precursor to my health anxiety was probably almost a year ago to the date when I felt a bump on my shoulder which I thought was a tumor. Of course it ended up being a deeply embedded pimple or cyst and resolved on its own after I went to the doctor who said the same thing. When I went into fullblown panic mode was back in April when I woke up with two puncture marks on my ankle after staying the night at a sister's house. Knowing that they once had an issue with a bat in the attic I assumed that a magical bat had made its way all the way downstairs embedded itself in the bowels of my sister's house and bit me on the ankle. Of course this magical bat must have had rabies too. Spoiler warning but I did not die of rabies and am not writing this as a ghost.My health anxiety probably climbed into a hysteria that consumed me last June. I was going to a university field station when I fell ill. Really ill. Not being able to keep down food or water for three days ill. Thus I flew home as I had missed much of the class and assumed that I was going to die and wanted to so around family. Yet again I did not die but the ordeal had traumatized me enough to sink into fulltime paranoia that I would not escape until October.Except for the occasional stomach ache things were fine for a month from a physical perspective but from a mental perspective if thinking I had terminal skin cancer from a 2mm mole was any indication I was in rough shape. In midJuly I developed the first sign of a rare birth defect that I did indeed end up having. Now before you go into a google symptom allow me to explain what happened my belly button burst open. It was not painful as I didn't know this had occurred for an hour. It wasn't until I looked down and saw that my outie had turned into a popped inside outie. I walked to the hospital and was diagnosed with cellulitis and told to go to a followup with the university doctors. Ultrasound showed nothing. It was only after a CT scan two months later that they saw a 1x2x3 sinus and cyst located behind and below my belly button. The operation was a success and it was removed two months ago. I even got an innie out of the ordeal. In between July and October I had been tested for just about anything and the only thing that came up were elevated liver enzymes and a weirdass belly button.In the meantime I had begun CBT and doubled my dosage of Celexa which is now down which helped a lot. Besides teaching me mindful thinking my therapist became a good outlet to just talk about life and my general grievances that I had been experiencing as a graduating senior from a top state university.To err on the side of caution my PCP sent me to a liver specialist to get my liver checked out. They tested me for any liver ailment you can think of and the only weird thing was my beta globulins ever so slightly out of range think 0.1 out of range when usually 1 or 2 out of range indicates an actual problem. Wanting to be as thorough as possible the pathologist recommended a BenceJones Test for leukemias myelomas and preleukemia. The test came back negative. Specialist ruled that it was just an off result due to my immune system still recovering from surgery about two and a half weeks before and I had had no other symptoms consistently. This final test was taken after Christmas break and ordered before it so despite being told I did not have a deadly illness I stewed over it.And then something happened. Something clicked in my head. I was sick of being prodded at and tested. I looked at my medical information logs for every time I visited the doctor and whenever I was with anyone but my PCP my blood pressure jumped thirty points and pulse went up to 90bpm over 70. Living in America I realized that doctors will NEVER stop running medical tests unless they are sure they have ruled out a condition. They don't want to get sued and if you have the insurance or money WILL run a test if you are insistent enough. This all hit me in about 24 hours. I decided that should that final test come back negative that I would only go to the doctor if anything were seriously and obviously wrong or for my psychiatric checkups. I only google things five minutes a day and I do not talk to my doctors over the patient portal only at appointments.My status has improved tremendously these past two and a half weeks. I wanted to tell you guys that there is hope and what you likely suffer from is a psychological issue. It really is. In seven months the only weird things they could find wasElevated liver enzymes likely prescription or slight fatty liver after a huge barrage of testsMaybe some gallbladder sludgestoneWeirdass belly button thing where if you had it would be very obvious or already addressed in your childhood having it through adulthood so unlikely that they like to write case studies on itAnd guess what? These were and are all very treatable. I came back here to post to tell you guys that it can get better. I felt a twinge in my upper right abdomen and got a little panicked tonight but this was the first time I felt even remotely worried about something in the last two weeks. I don't know if it'll take therapy different meds getting sick of tests or all three but you can get there. Don't give up.,Anxiety
34078,Possible Ear Infection? So my left ear is a bit red and itchy it also feels like its burning and its tender to touch in certain places especially just before the inside of the ear and behind the ear like the rounded bit on the outside.I think it might be my earphones that have caused the problem so Ive stopped using them for a couple days.Im not sure if this is something I should go to the doctor about or not. I know ear infections and stuff dont really need treated but I wasnt sure if I should just wait it out or go see a doctor about it. ,Anxiety
34079,Melanoma on Upper Back? I've been anxious my whole life about my health. However it seems that I kill myself over nothing because in the end I had nothing. But now something concerning appeared a weird patch that is slightly darker than the rest and it isn't symmetrical. I just noticed this and I'm REALLY freaking out. I'm a minor and I don't know when I can schedule another doctors appointment. I've read that it can be extremely dangerous. I don't know what to do or how to handle my emotions right now.,Anxiety
34080,Random itchiness? Just looking for possibilities I guess here's what happenedI'm preparing to move by putting stuff into boxes today I focused on decorations such as figurines around the house military memorabilia books and small miscellaneous items. The only thing out of the ordinary was an old roommate's uniform that moved out like 6 months ago that was sitting under where I put my motorcycle helmet I picked it up and unfurled it saw it was his put it in my roommates pile of stuff. About 45 minutes later give or take my arms became itchy incredibly itchy.When I looked at it it looked like a rash all on one side of my forearm basically exactly where the uniform touched and then a couple of welt like spots a bit away. I washed my arms but a little bit after I was itchy on the middle of my back shoulder upper thighs calves ankles chest and stomach. I hopped immediately in the shower and changed clothes.There is a chance it was old fuel on the uniform I have a stuffed nose and can't smell a thing. My friend hasn't had a rash of any sort. Any thoughts?FYI I'm going to medical in the morning I just want thoughts now is all,Anxiety

My throat feels like it has something stuck in it on the right side. It doesnt hurt to talk or anything but there is a very small pain when I swallow. I still have my tonsils and Ive never had issues with them beforehand. I got convinced that I have throat cancer as I smoke. I dont smoke that much in a day and Ive been smoking for about 4 years. I am getting very anxious and I dont know what I should do. Im starting to believe that its my cold and I need to drink more water. What do you guys think?,Anxiety

34084,Struggling with hantavirus fear... I can't rationalize out of it Hi all.. Never posted here but I've been struggling with health anxiety for about a year.I'm just really scared and anxious right now. I woke up yesterday with a cough which progressed to lung pain. I've never had lung pain so I think that is where a lot of this fear is coming from. Last night I got a fever and today I'm pretty sick. Fever mild sore throat productive cough and pretty bad body aches.See I'm freaking out about hantavirus because two weeks ago I dismantled a crappy structure in my sunroom where my dogs hang out. It was really really dusty. So much dust. I didn't wear a mask or anything. I didn't see any mice or droppings or anything but there was so much dust. To make matters worse I live in New Mexico where hantavirus is most common. I also live in a county where there was a case in 2016.This just doesn't feel like my normal kind of sick. It started in my lungs where usually when I get sick my first symptoms is a sore throat and stuffy nose. Now my nose is barely stuffy but I have a really bad cough. It's been a long time since I've had a fever and I can't recall getting muscle aches before this.All the factors combined are freaking me out really bad. I live in the state it is most common I cleaned out an enclosed space where there was lots of dust and now two weeks later within the incubation period I came down with a sickness that I feel is unusual for me.Someone please talk to me. I don't know what to do or how to get rid of this crazy fear I feel. I can't stop googling about hantavirus. I've been at it for hours since I woke up today.,Anxiety
34085,Hair fall So I've posted here before regarding my hair loss issue. I mentioned in my previous post that I have a very oily scalp and a lot of dandruff on my hair and as a result I have bald patches. Some people recommend me to see the doctor for second opinion so I visited another dermatologist today. She was able to diagnose my problem. She said I have a very severe hair loss at a very early age I'm only 17. The problem she mentioned was androgenic alopecia. She said normally this problem is caused because of genetics but since none of my family members are bald it's probably due to an harmonal imbalance. So I'm wondering is there anyone who suffered from a similar problem and how did they manage to recover their hair?,Anxiety
34086,Always think I have cancer So I remember it started in high school where I started having a bump grow on a specific spot on my head and I never had any real fear before this time. I remember sitting in my class googling bump in that location and it said swollen lymph node which could be a sign of cancer. At first I was like ok no its probably just a pimple but then two weeks after that I got another one on my head where another lymph node was supposed to be located. I was terrified and I thought this was it. I went to the doctors made them send me to specialists the whole 9 yards and they kept telling me thats not a lymph node but I was convinced they had no idea what they were talking about because I read so many articles on google. Turns out they were just cysts. Since then that has sparked my fear of always thinking I had cancer. That was 3 years ago and since then I have been convinced I had bone cancer brain cancer and now stomach cancer. I have been a heavy weed smoker for a while and I started to get a tightness and cramping pains in my stomach I associated with the weed. So I quit and 2 days after quitting I got really bad runs I was nauseas and I threw up a couple times. I lost 15 pounds during this period which was a feeder into yep its cancer. The strange thing is when I stared getting better my symptoms only appeared in the morning. After this period I thought maybe it was just a sickness and not the weed so I smoked all day everyday again for another week but then started waking up nauseas so I quit again and again a couple days after quitting I got the runs. Its been brutal and I have since gotten a lot better. Although my stomach still hasnt gone back to normal Im now terrified every morning because thats usually when I go the bathroom and I freak out I have stomach cancer. I wouldnt leave my doctor alone at the time and made her run so many tests and everything always came back fine. I just want to know how some people got over this irrational fear. Im only 19 and on the cancer statistics website shows less than 1 of people who get this cancer are under 20 and most of them have a family history of it so my chances are very unlikely which I can understand but a part of me is still terrified. Thanks in advance! ,Anxiety
34087,How do you know when it's real or just anxiety? I have a problem where I want to get checked by doctors a lot even when they say I'm fine I try to insist they run more tests. I've heard of people who will often have stories like My cancer wasn't discovered at first by the doctors but I had a gut feeling and insisted more tests and then my cancer was found! So I'm not sure when to give up and accept it's my healthy anxiety or if I should trust my gut and ask for more tests and exams. My doctors said I am too young for breast cancer 22 but it's still possible right? I don't know when to give up or if I should look into it more. What do you guys do? How can you tell if it's real or not?,Anxiety
34088,Need Support ASAP for rabies fear!! So on January 4th almost 2 weeks ago I pet and gently moved a friendly cat out of the road by a local restaurant. He let me pick him up under one arm in my fluffy winter coat without too much resistance or fighting back but darted off a little peturbed once I moved him. He may have lightly dug his claws in for balance and surprise at being moved but as a germaphobe who is very afraid of cat scratch fever I feel I would've noticed excessive claws making it through my winter layers.I went about my night my birthday night without much else of a thought for the cat. The next morning I did discover a fair amount of dried bleeding and cutscraped area on my elbow that I'm still not sure how it came to be. But again I patched it up and went about my days. Its since healed fine. I wasn't intoxicated but I had been out dancing late and thought maybe I bumped it at some point.Fast forward to today January 17th and the talk of rabies comes up. Suddenly I remember the cat and mysterious scratch. Surely I would've known if the cat did It? He was friendly docile and clean. I figured he belonged to some one living in the city located nearby to the place we were eating at since he was chubby and had a soft clean coat. But now I'm freaked out! Should I talk to my Dr about getting a rabies shot now?! Its been 2 weeks on Saturday.I fully intend to call my Dr in the morning and have spoken to the nurse hotline. I just know they also kind of have to give me the just in case response and would like some more candid input.,Anxiety
34089,I'd been told it was just anxiety for two years and now I've been diagnosed with a tumor I developed Panic Disorder when I was in college shortly after the Virginia Tech Massacre. I was a freshman at Virginia Tech when it happened and my sophomore year I started to have deepseeded health anxiety fear of death mostly. I'd suffered through many family deaths before and psychologists had told me I had PTSD with fear of dying. I DO have health anxiety and I border on hypochondria. HOWEVER!When you already have a PD diagnosis or a hypochondria diagnosis I find that doctors don't take you seriously. I completely understand why they wouldn't it's tiresome for them when you come in and tell them you're having a heart attack when you're really suffering from GERD. When I first saw a doctor and told her that it felt like I'd broken my rib three times in one year she sent me to a psychiatrist. The next doctor told me I needed to up my Prozac. Finally a CT scan showed I have a severe Fibrous Dysplasia tumor in my 10th rib which is growing into my liver kidney and diaphragm. I'm scheduled for surgery on March 5th. It's hard to know when it's your health anxiety and when it's your health and GOOD LORD it's tiring for us anxious people to convince doctors that we're having a real problem. I honestly still don't know how to tell the difference but I'm here to say SOMETIMES your gut is right.Anyone else have trouble with doctors writing them off because of their Anxiety or Hypochondria?,Anxiety
34090,Flu Fear! Oh boy. It's DEFINITELY that time of the year. The time of year to search all over the internet for articles on flu statistics and reading through the sad cases of people who were killed by it and subsequently sending yourself into a spiral of anxiety when you remember the fact that you did not get your flu shot this year.I've never gotten the flu. I haven't gotten the shot in a few years too I believe. My doctor asked me if I wanted it a few months ago but I foolishly said no at the time because I was in a rush to leave. Boy do I regret it now.I go back to college in about 2 weeks and I am stressed. I suppose it's not too late to go get it but that doesn't quell my anxiety over the fact it's only 10 effective anyway. Jeez.TLDR I'm afraid I'm going to be one of those rare cases of someone dying of the flu. I need to stop reading. I'm hoping for some solidarity here. Does anyone else have this fear especially considering this season is supposedly very bad?,Anxiety
34091,Hip still swollen 4 months after fall anxiety about it hangs over me. About months ago I fell and landed on my hip. I stayed down for a minute or two only because I didn't think it would be a good idea to get up immediately but then I got up and was fine. It was sore that night but that was about it. The swelling started that night too. Maybe a week and a half later I went to the doctor about it. He didn't do any xrays but he felt around and tested my range of motion. My range of motion was fine and I didn't have any pain and he said everything felt like normal swelling. He said it looked like the normal response to a fall and that swelling can take 5 weeks to heal I think. So here I am 17 weeks later and my hip is still swollen. There was a moment where it hurt for a bit about 2 months ago but that was only for a week or two. The anxiety about it hangs over me. It's always there as something that actually shouldn't be happening something that to me is not easily explainable.,Anxiety
34092,Health anxiety due to unexplainable scars on face skin In late 2016 I went throught a very bad episode of depression and health anxiety which lasted a couple of months. Managed to tell myself that everything is alright and ignored all kind of twitchespains that were temporary that use to bring anxious people like me a lot of bad thoughts.Since around summer 2017 I started noticing small scars and little holes appearing on my face skin for no apparent reason. I have no acnee or other skin condition I always had clear and clean skin. I went to a specialist and he couldnt put a diagnose tested me for some antiimmune stuff which came out fine.I'm trying to ignore it but every few days a new hole appears and its destroying my face a bit at a time. I think I will soon succumb to the thoughts and lose it again in front of health anxiety.How do you people put up with apparently minor issues that bug you for long periods without knowing why it happens?

It started back in June 2017 random pain that comes and goes and only last for like a few seconds or so. It happens sometimes near center of my chest to the left or upper left near shoulder. It also disappeared and stopped after a few months then came back again in October and disappeared again and came back again. I've been to the doctor and he said my heart beat was fine blood pressure was fine blood test turned out normal mostly just need a bit of exercise to lower fat.

34095,Just looking for some advice. First a little backstory sorry if a bit long. Up until last year I was an extremely sedentary 28yo weighing around 265 lbs. I started a new job that is fairly physical and since then I have dropped down to 230ish. Well last week I was laying down and felt something I never felt before in my chest. I went to the doctor and he said it was almost certainly my xiphoid process. I also mentioned I had a general cough I us an ecigarette as well as a periodical tingle under my right shoulderblade. Other than those three things I felt completely normal.My doctor said everything felt normal my blood pressure was normal as was my pulse and he checked me out with a stethoscope. In the end he ordered an xray to be certain. From that appointment up until I got my results I started stressing out tight chest sweating vomiting trouble sleeping just overall freaking out about what that xray might show. Low and behold I got my result and everything came back looking completely normal. Although that is great news I haven't been able to ditch the tight chest trouble sleeping with bad thoughts and general feeling of just being uncomfortable. I also wear a fitbit to work and constantly find myself checking my heart rate between 59 when I sleep and 120ish when i'm up working. Sorry for the wall of text I am just hoping someone here could give me some tips on managing this stress. I have a yearly physical next month that can't get here soon enough.Thank you.,Anxiety

34104,Health anxiety vent My massive fear is getting pregnant. Every twinge I have no matter what is pregnancy. This all started from an increase in anxiety levels after ironically staring the birth control pill.Its been going on for months. No amount of doctors visits home tests visits to a sexual health nurse not even having penetrative sex or even a blood test has managed to completely calm me down. If it does it only lasts for a few hours. All I think is of women I read about on the internet who have been 8 months pregnant without any tests and still getting periods or if Im ectopic my Mum nearly died from one of those.Ive had nexplanon put in my arm but the stories online of women getting pregnant somehow overrule the data that says its 99.9 effectivemy nurse saying she wouldnt even do a test on me if I came in with nexplanon claiming to be pregnant. Ive just started CBT and Im on antidepressants citalopram which I dont think is working after 5 weeks on 10mg. Im just terrified that Ill never get better and Ill have to leave my university and my boyfriend and friends in London and move home to my parents again who I adore but I never wanted to stay at home for uni. That would be a massive defeat for me.Just needed to vent because Im fkin terrified right now and all I can thing about is the pain Im getting in my stomach and if its a baby kicking me.,Anxiety
34105,Stomach just WON'T stop acting up on fire etc. Would an MRI detect anything serious? I was sent to the hospital because my stomach was giving me immense trouble. They performed a colored MRI on me but I'm still worried because I don't fully understand what it's supposed to detect. If they were looking for like some sort of bowel thing would they have missed something like colon cancer or something serious? Does an MRI even detect stuff like that? They sent it to an outsourced radiology firm because they didn't have a radiologist onsite at night. The problem is my stomach still will NOT stop. It's acting up immensely. I've gotten over a lot of my health anxiety to the point where I've been off meds but I had to take a pill today to relax. My family does think something's wrong as I'm always fatigued pale nauseous etc. I'm getting a full blood work panel done soon because my iron was extremely low some time ago so they wanna check again also because diabetes runs in my family like crazy.Couple with an MRI and a full blood work panel this Wednesday what are the chances of them missing something?Thanks!lt3,Anxiety
34106,Paranoia and Anxiety about that Brain Eating Amoeba Hi everyone. I'm pretty new to this sub but I really need to vent. I was diagnosed with Illness Anxiety Disorder two years ago and I generally have a pretty good hold of it. Yesterday I was showering and a drop or two or water got into one nostril in my nose. I could feel it chilling in my nose hair and I immediately used my towel to wipe it out and then I blew my nose when I got out of the shower. However I live in Florida and I'm really paranoid that the brain eating amoeba is lurking in the water. This was water from the shower head in my dorm and it has been colder lately but I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I'm terrified I'm even tearing up with fear writing this. My birthday is next week and I want to be okay for that and for everything. My mom said I'm worrying needlessly and she's probably right but I can't shake the anxiety.Edit to add It doesn't help that symptoms apparently don't develop for 19 days after infection so I'm going to be sitting in my anxiety for days.,Anxiety
34107,Deep scratch from unvaccinated cat Hey so last night I got a deep scratch from a cat on my thumb. It was bleeding quite a bit until I cleaned it up and bandaged it.The cat was born to a stray mother at my friend's parents store and was adopted by my friend as a kitten. It hasn't been vaccinated and is about 6 months1 year old. My friend and his family have been scratched quite a bit by the cat as well but not as of late. It's a house cat and rarely ever leaves the house.I keep looking up various diseases I could be exposed too cat scratch disease rabies etc. The wound itself looks fine thankfully been over 12hrs. Should I be worried about anything? Any symptoms I should look out for? I want to ease my mind and stop worrying but I can't seem to..,Anxiety
34108,Can anyone describe what the symptom of back pain from cancer feels like? I read a lot that back pain is a symptom of cancer However I can't find a description of what that back pain feels like. I can't even find a description that says there is no commonality to back pain from cancer. So it leaves me in the dark.Is there anything that describes what the pain feels like? Does it not stop even if you lie still? Does it stay in one location or does it move around? Can it be light pain or is it always a severe pain? I would love to know if there's anything common to this pain or if any back pain ie. small large constant only when moving reproducible nonreproducible etc are all symptoms of cancer?,Anxiety
34109,Panic over Collapsed lung Pneumothrax So I had some chest and back pain on the left side when breathing in deeply for a couple of minutes. Of course cue the googling must be a collapsed lung.Apparently it can happen for no real reason and its most common in tallskinny people in early 20's.

Over the course of 5 years I have had 3 EKG done 3 blood checks 1 xray of my chest and lungs 1 echo of my heart a stress test and a 24h monitor of my heart. Everything is fine. I'm fit. Why can't I convince myself of these things when I feel sensations? Why do I keep suspecting my chest pains and palpitations to be a more serious heart problem?

34112,Help I was doing so well with my fears of colon cancer over the Christmas period. My symptoms were minimal and I finally truly believed I didnt have it. But now im scared I wont see another Christmas again. Ive been having slight feelings of being sick thin stools stomach ache and a sore anus on and off. I dont think Ive had blood but sometimes stools are darker than others. And I feel a pain slightly in my left side when I put pressure on it and Im convinced I have a lump there when no one else can feel anything. Im only 15 so Im told chances arent very likely. But my grandma had it at around 60 so thats what worries me. Around 23 weeks before I started worrying I had blood and urine tests due to another worry and I was completely clear of anything. But maybe that was too early to detect anything. Ive been in this state for like 6 months now. And its tearing my life apart not knowing whether or not Im gonna be here in a few months,Anxiety

I started having flu symptoms on Thursday and they cleared up yesterday for the most part. All I have left is a cough and some dizziness. I'm so afraid something will happen to me where I'll die or something because of how deadly this flu is supposed to be. am I being silly and am I going to be ok since my fever is gone and I feel mostly better or is there still a chance something weird could happen??

34115,I definitely need this group! It's almost debilitating... I find bulging veins and I think they are blood clots I feel a lump and automatically think it's cancer I have chest pain and think it's a heart attack I have diarrhea and think it's bowl cancer headache and it's a tumor... The list goes on! And on top of that it creates insane panic attacks that make it all so much worse. My legs shake my stomach hurts I always feel pain wherever I assume there's something wrong my vision gets blurry I hyperventilate and feel faint... I don't know what to do! Even when I hear of something like water intoxication I immediately start getting nervous that I drank too much water. When I hear sitting can cause blood clots I immediately get extremely worried that I have been sitting too much... Even hearing about broken bones or something like that I get anxious about doing anything! I'm glad I came across this. I was about to post in the Health forum about what to do about some of my issues. Haha. ,Anxiety
34116,Constantly checking for signs of brain problem Hey guys. So this is a little difficult to explain so hopefully I can describe it as cohesively as possible. So a couple months ago I developed a little obsession with misreading things. I misread a couple of words and immediately began to think there is something wrong with my brain. Well now its manifested itself in just about everything. In a bizarre way to prove I dodont have a problem Ive begun subconsciously checking every thing I read and hear to see if I made a mistake. For instance Ill skim a headline really fast online then get frustrated when I misread it even though I didnt carefully read it. Because Im now checking every single word I read and hear Im constantly misreading mishearing and misunderstanding things because Im focusing on each individual word and not the sentence as a whole. Its mentally exhausting and is effecting my reasoning skills and memory which of course is fueling my health anxiety as it further proves I have something wrong with me. Of course occupying my mind with this causes me to make many many mistakes which you guessed it fuels it more. Has anyone else struggled with health anxiety pertaining to a brain problem? This really sucks. ,Anxiety
34117,Oral cancer fears It's been at least weeks since I've noticed it but who knows how long it's actually been there. I'm not even sure how to describe the location. It's not on the hard palate but kind of in between that and the hard part of the gums on the inner side of teeth.If you take your tongue and reach it as far back as you can even past the final molar on top that's where it is.Anyways I felt with my tongue recently that there was a small lump. If I look in my mouth there is no sore or anything. But I can feel it with my tongue and finger. I just touched it with my hand again and I believe it is movable as well but I'm not 100 percent on that. It doesn't currently hurt to the touch but weeks ago it was tender when I would use my finger.I can't get it looked at until February 5th and my health anxiety was doing so well for about a year now but now I'm freaking out and it's affecting my sleep amongst other things.,Anxiety
34118,Kind of freaking out now 'heavy' arm sweating. nausea I'm 26 years old male overweight 5' 10 250lb nonsmoker infrequent drinker non drug user sedentary lifestyler and my doctor has been monitoring my triglycerides for several years I'm a carb addict. For the last several days I've been feeling kind of off. I've had what I think feel like low blood sugar episodes lightheadedness feeling faint slight nauseaabdominal discomfort that got better after I had some candy. I've also had feelings of 'fuzziness' in my hands and feet that come and go throughout the last several days. Not pins and needles or even a 'static' feeling just 'fuzzy'.Today my left arm feels 'heavy'. That's the best way I can describe it. I seem to have normal strength in it and it's not numb anywhere just 'heavy'. It's worth noting that I sleep on my sides I switch sides several times throughout the night and due to the way I position my arms it's not uncommon for me to wake up with an arm asleep. Is it possible for a slepton arm to retain an odd feeling for several hours after waking up?Today I had my favorite meal mom's spaghetti. Once I got myself a serving though I found that I was lacking appetite. I began to feel kind of nauseous and began sweating. Nausea and sweating combined with the heavy arm freaked me out badly for a while. I took some peptobismol and don't really feel nauseous anymore I'm not sweating anymore but my arm still feels weird. I was pretty close to deciding to go to the ER for a little bit there but I don't know. I think I'm going to make an appointment with my doctor for Monday. This sucks. I'm on Citalopram for anxiety that was discovered after I went to the ER with heart palptations chest discomfort and trouble breathing when I was 19. I'm kind of a hypochondriac. Why does it have to be my left arm that feels weird? I could probably ignore the right arm but since all the heart attack literature focuses on the left arm I'm freaking out. ,Anxiety
34119,Heart fluttering So my doctor knows I have hypochondria and he's a bit old fashioned so he rarely goes out of his way to look for something that might be wrong with me. However I've been having among other things severe heart palpitations a couple times a minute most of the time and he simply dismissed it as probably nothing. Should I be worried? This happens even when I'm not anxious in the slightest and very regularly and I figure heart conditions should be looked into,Anxiety

I'm nearing my 30's so I don't know if this is just a normal part of me getting older or if I'm going blind. My dad lost his eyesight due to diabetes I am not diabetic so it makes me worry a little.

34124,Lyme Disease MS? Like many of us I am scared to have Lyme disease or MS. I've had a facial paralysis for about a month. For a period I convinced myself that I'm healthy and that it was only a bell's palsy but lately I've been thinking it's Lyme because I'm always superexhausted when waking up and I'm tired after walking stairs and have neurological symptoms like weakness on one side on left side of the body also lyme can cause facial paralysis so I keep thinking about it. I've had a blood test and EMG that were fine except something to do with allergies in my blood. Should I be worried? ,Anxiety
34125,Nervous about pain in throat after eating garlic amp venting Hi everybodySo Ive been suffering from health anxiety for about 4 years now. It all started with a donkey biting my arm while on vacation. Since then Ive had the rabies shots twice. I go to my doctor many times a year. Ive developed a chronic pain on my shoulder. And I pretty much freak out over every little symptom.Last night my mom called me to tell me she was coming down with a cold. I remembered that yesterday I borrowed her scarf and used it all day. Wanting to prevent a cold I crushed a raw garlic clove and ate it. Ive done this before many times and normally it just gives me a little acid reflux. Ive noticed that raw garlic keeps me pretty healthy overall. However this time I developed a burning sensation in my throat about fives minutes after I ate it. It has now been burning me for about 6 hours. I woke up in the middle of the night and have not been able to go back to sleep. I had some milk and a banana and took ibuprofen to see if it would help the painburning sensation. Even my chest started hurting which never usually happens to me. Im embarrassed to go to the hospital for just a stupid raw garlic but my mind is going there and Im already catastrophizing everything ie Ive burned a hole through my throat this will somehow lead to death etc. Im hoping the symptoms go down within the next couple of hours otherwise the pain will get the better of me and I might actually go to the emergency room.In times like these I hate myself and how miserable I make life for myself. Why cant I just get over these dumb fears? If I wasnt so afraid all the time I wouldnt have eaten the garlic. My anxiety and negative thinking is probably making my pain and symptoms worse Im an expert at that.Im just really tired of constantly being in pain for some reason or another. This sucks. ,Anxiety
34126,I'm convinced I have HIV. I've had a bit of HIVphobia for a while now and I realize now it was mostly unfounded. But this summer it got worse. I have no job right now and I wasn't going to school so I spent most of the summer inside to an unhealthy extent. When I did go out for long enough I developed a rash that I think is PMLE which is a mild allergy to sunlight not fun but harmless. Then I saw that it can be a symptom of HIV infection. Granted I've never had this reaction before. The page said it can develop around my age and nearnonexistent sun exposure mixed with periods of high exposure can probably cause reactions like that especially since it was a pretty brutal summer but I'm still terrified.Around this time I also started to develop these purplish veinlike patterns on my legs and that just made me panic even more because I couldn't just explain that away. I am overweight and I think I gained some weight during the summer so I thought of stretch marks but aren't those usually white? They seem to be going away now but that's only a little comforting.I've never done drugs or even had sex. But I remember finding an unexplained cut on my finger a few years ago that I'm afraid might have been from a needle in the trash where I worked at the time. I don't remember exactly when that happened. I haven't been getting sick often or having issues with infections but would I really notice those things if my immune system wasn't working properly? Isn't the immune system where most of the symptoms come from?I still haven't been going out as much as I probably should and I realize that I probably have a severe vitamin D deficiency so that might be causing some of this but I don't know if it can explain everything. I keep checking my skin for any changes fearing the worst. I'm really scared.,Anxiety
34127,Really bad health anxiety at night Some background... I was diagnosed with OCD in the third grade but was suspected of having it long before that. I have bad intrusive thoughts. I've been in and out of therapy for many years. Within the past few years my health anxiety has gotten bad again like it was when I was a child. In late 2016 when I was 19 I went through a phase where I thought I was dying Every. Single. Night. I ended up having so many panic attacks and losing a lot of friends. I lost over 60 pounds in like 23 months. I got into a relationship on the tail end of this breakdown and am still with my partner. It helped a lot and continues to help.Now like a year and a half later it's not as bad as it was in that period but the symptoms linger still. I haven't had a checkup since a little before the breakdown in 2016. I'll go to the doctor if I catch a cold or whatever but not for a checkup.Now....this is because I'm like terrified that I'll find out that I have a terminal illness. Cancer of any type kidney failure some kind of disease... whatever it doesn't matter. Whenever I think about it I freak out and get nauseous and scared. When I'm laying in bed at night I will feel my boobs for lumps and always convince myself something is there when it isn't in different parts of my boobs. I've gotten to a point where I dont even like touching them. I know it would be better to just find out and get to fix it asap but it scares me so bad I'm afraid it would just ruin my will to live. I'm not currently in therapy but I know i need to be.It's the worst at night when my boyfriend is asleep but it's seeping over into my daily life. If my biology prof starts talking about cancer my thoughts just spiral out of control making me think I have it. It's gotten so bad that I actually have anxiety about the anxiety itself. I just need to know that I'm not alone. I would also appreciate any advices or exercises that help...,Anxiety

Im trying to not think of the worst thing as nothing else is wrong with me. I got these in the past its just been a while. I REALLY want to google but i shouldnt right? If it was deadly well Id probably already be dropped dead not typing this coherently etc etc. Trying to calm myself as to not go into a wave of anxiety.,Anxiety
34129,thankful to have found this sub I just stumbled upon this sub and I came here to say I am so thankful that it exists. I have been suffering from health anxiety and death centered panic disorder since I was 7 years old. I was so young that I had absolutely no idea what panic attacks were and concluded that there was something medically wrong with me causing my symptoms. This is where my health anxiety began. I wasn't able to fully be a child as i spent 8 years fearing for my life in silence thinking i was dying of this ailment or that ailment i was too afraid to tell my parents. Since then I am a 23 year old going to therapy and taking medications and working out my issues.

34134,paranoid about testicles and now I'm freaking out So I'm totally serious here and I know it sounds like I'm trying to be funny but I'm not! A week ago I was lazy and didn't do laundry so I went commando for pretty much a week. Because of how loose it was down there I became more aware of my testicles and would reach down there more often. Anyways because I was constantly reaching down there I became paranoid about my testicles. I should also note that I was a frequent fapper like 34 times a day and decided to stop that. So I would go nofap for 2 days and then have a go at it once the next day. Then again 2 days not and then on the 3rd day have a go at it. I started this 2 weeks ago and last week I felt a little pinch on my left testicle. It didn't hurt or anything it was just... uncomfortable but went away fairly quickly but that feeling only heightened my paranoia!!I haven't felt that feeling since but I keep thinking about it and now I keep imagining I do have that feeling again. I always constantly reach down there feeling them and thinking omg one is bigger than the other! omg one feels softer than the other! I'm dying!I want to go to the doctor but I also have a fear of doctors! I can't sleep. I'm undereating. I sometimes cry at night. I was never like this and I hate it. Last year I was paranoid about my neck which took me a while to get over and now it's below the belt. I just want to live my life normally again. ,Anxiety
34135,Just venting a bit... Hello guys. For the past month or so Ive been dealing with daily stress from thinking I have something. It started out with weakness and fatigue and stomach and stool issues which I attributed to colorectal cancer. After multiple blood tests and ct scans that found nothing I made the mistake of looking up my symptoms on doctor google and found als. Ever since this was early Jan Ive been over analyzing every symptom I have and havent had real peace of mind. Its taken a huge toll on me mentally and I plan to get help. Im the last 3 weeks Ive gone from having twitches all over to burning in my arms to twitching in my hand and now what looks like atrophy in my thenar muscles. I am scared and I just wanted to get it off my chest since my neuro referral wont come for like another month. Things I have going for me I am a 23 year old Hispanic male and statistically less probable to get the disease. my twitches are widespread which is uncommon in als. Only recently have they been in my right hand more focused. the lack of strength I originally felt isnt there anymore nor am I dropping things or have any strength loss that I can see. I have gotten back into the gym and can lift things comfortably and well. no family history of neuro diseases. this has been going on for a month without affecting my life other than mentally Things I worry about My right hand palm has some visible dents and lines that I feel have gotten more pronounced. This has not resulted in weakness but they seem to have gotten worse. Ive googled a lot of pictures and compared to friends and family and I havent found any that look like mine. All Ive found are clearly atrophied which at that point is completely obvious and dont look like mine. Mine look as though Im missing muscle strips and crevices. on the same right hand the thenar muscles have begun twitching as of 5 days ago. My index finger especially will twitch and jump on its own. Also my right thumbhand is less flexible than my left. Thanks for reading ,Anxiety

But somehow Ive managed to convince myself that somethings wrong with it. The only thing thats convincing me is that its not perfectly round and that its dark brown which doesnt mean much really.

So I've been seeing chiropractors and getting massages. Turns out my spine is fucked up and I'm constantly getting muscle spasms because.... My boobs are too big Way better than a faulty heart but not exactly the cheapest problem to fix. Hoping to get reduction surgery within the next 2 years ,Anxiety

I have been pretty good about health anxiety the past year but now I'm starting to get nervous because the pain will not go away. I can't see anything different physically but it really hurts a lot. I made the mistake of googling aaand now I'm paranoid I have mouth cancer or something. It doesnt help that I have a bad habit of chewing the skin inside my mouth. ,Anxiety
34146,ExSmoker Fear and Excessive Research Hi everyone.As a health anxiety sufferer I have an interesting story to share.A few years ago I picked up a habit of smoking hookah. I smoked cigars for a bit as well throughout the same period.I smoked hookah probably between 100 and 200 times in all.Once I left my masters program a few years later I felt a pain in my back. This was my first bout with health anxiety. I couldn't figure out what was causing it so Googling symptoms led me to lung cancer.I thought I smoked so it could be true. Then I saw this awful number online Hookah 100 Cigarettes according to various news organizations citing the WHO.This terrified me. I smoked the equivalent of FIVE PACKS every time I smoked?!Of course eventually I found out that lung cancer was not the case. It was a messed up nerve. Physical therapy and some posture fixes and that particular back pain is more under control. I also have chronic back pain I believe as a result of anxiety and a lack of movement.Fast forward a few years.At the beginning of this year I started having a high level of health anxiety after visiting the dermatologist and having some moles removed. They were dysplastic nevuses he removed them but honestly probably didn't even need to.I started freaking out about melanoma but when I realized I could relatively well see and manage that if it were to happen as long as I stay vigilant about skin checks and doc checkups melanoma is not a big threat.But then the lung cancer scare came back.I frantically tried to understand how much damage had I done. Pack years how many do I have? 1? 5? 10?I've read probably 100 different studies done a thousand google searches to understand the connection between hookah smoking and lung cancer.Long story short this led me down a path of compulsively studying. I also went back and reconstructed my year of smoking down to the daybyday level. I've requested transaction logs from my bank to see when I was in a particular place when COULD I have smoked?Some of this was actually helpful. I narrowed down my smoking to a possible 215 days many of which I likely didn't smoke anyway. So I shrunk that fear a bit by looking at the reality.Some of the other research I did was helpful too looking into the claim of 100cigarette equivalence revealed that the number stated is referring to the volume of smoke not necessarily the equivalence of hazard. I can't take a solid guess as to a better number but the research I've read looks like much less than 100 for an average session.Lastly a lot of this research was NOT helpful as my interpretation of the research caused me to catastrophize it.My setup is a perfect example of what would drive a health anxiety sufferer insane Reason to believe that something bad could happen my shortlived smoking habit ambiguity on the risk very little research on hookah and its impact on your health lots of scary media surrounding smoking and finally my dodgy memory of how often and how much I smoked during that year.This is a perfect recipe for fear for a health anxiety sufferer.My wife and I had our first son last year. All of this fear has grown into a tragic story where my son loses his father at a young age because his father smoked hookah for a year. This all sounds silly from the outside but completely plausible from the inside.I want to encourage health anxiety sufferers who have analytical brains like me focus on what is in front of you today. There is nothing you can do to change what happened yesterday. Be aware but don't ruminate. Look for actions you can take today to be healthy not reasons why you aren't healthy.I'm learning that no matter what risk levels I have there is nothing I can do to nail that down perfectly and trying to nail it down keeps rumination and negative thoughts constantly in my head. The whatif questions stay present. The hyperfocusing on what my shortened life would look like that pervades my mental state.Now today is the day where I look at what I have and say thank you for it. Look at my past and accept it. Look at my risk and accept it. Look at the future with belief and hope for the best rather than constantly fearing the worst.,Anxiety

It went from that to 120! then I waited a five minutes standing and it only went down to 108.So I tried again this time I sat down for 5 minutes my heart rate was 78. Stood up and it went to 102 waited 10 minutes this time and it was about the same maybe a little higher to 108.And none of this is walking around or anything didn't check that but no doubt it would be higher.Is this a cause for concern?

34151,Question about bone cracks So I've been going to the gym weekly now and I've noticed this for the first time but my right shoulder seems to crack alot and I mean if I do those shoulder rolls it cracks when I bench press my shoulders would crack really loud and sometimes there's pain inside my shoulder? I'm guessing where my shoulder bones connect to my arm it doesn't really hurt on a regular basis in my life only when I do heavy lifting using my shoulder. The cracks are loud and my friends usually get surprised about how loud my shoulder can crack I've been debating to try to reach out to a chiropractor friend of mine but just curious to see if anyone else has experienced this! Im also pretty skinny below average weight if that could be a factor. Thanksny help,Anxiety

34153,The worry of a pulomnary embolism is ruining my life!! Edit Darn...I should have spellchecked my title. I'm a 21 year old college student with GAD. In october I stood up after class and had a weird pain in my right calf. It went on everyday for over a month in total and I became convinced I had a blood clot. I went to the ER twice and got negative results on the blood clot tests. Still I couldn't reconcicle this. I kept having random chest pains shoulder pains palpitations etc. It might have just been anxiety idk. But the daily pain went away around late october. Just this past week the exact pain started up again in the exact same spot. I am getting anxious and having the same chest symptoms. I really hope this is all just my anxiety but I don't know. It feels so real. My october doctors appts and ER visits cost SO much money. I want to go to the ER again but they thought I was crazy last time and I can't put my family in more debt. So I don't know what to do. But I truly feel like I am having a pulmonary embolism and dying. Anyone else have similar issues? I can't focus and I am terrified. ,Anxiety
34154,What symptom did you have that you thought was a sign of something terrible but just ended up going away? I have more than I can count.A headache albeit mild that lasted for a month. A MONTH. I mean what else could that have been other than a brain tumor? Well that was ten years ago. Headache went away and there's no brain tumor!A persistent twitching in my eyelid and facial cheek that I thought was a sign of some terrible neurological disease. It went away. Occasionally it comes back and then goes away again. Tingling in my hands and thighs for several months that I thought for sure was a sign of MS. It just kind of went away over time. About 8 years ago. Noticing countless little red dots all over my body after reading that they were a sign of a type of Leukemia. Was convinced for 6 months that I had leukemia. I even started cataloging all instances of my red dots in a spreadsheet so I could keep track of which ones were new. There's a ton more but what were your symptoms of imminent death that just kind of fizzled out?,Anxiety

34156,Kind of freaking out because of mild night sweats Im a healthy 18 yo male that probably has anxiety issues including health anxiety. Ive never seen a doctor specifically for it because it has never really gotten in the way of my life just occasionally my head. Anyway Ive been experiencing some mild night sweats the past couple days. I wake up an hour or two after going to sleep and my shirt is generally damp. Its not enough sweating to change sheets or anything but sometimes I have to remove my shirt. Ive had on and off night sweats in the past that freaked me out such as last winter when I almost convinced myself I had some type of cancer because well a quick search on google led me to Mayo Clinic and... I think you can get the rest this might have been a good time to see a doctor about anxiety.... Also I had some mild night sweats for a while last month but after I returned home from college they miraculously stopped. Last night was particularly bad in that my shirt was definitely soaked when I woke up in the middle of the night but I just took it off and after stressing over it for a couple minutes got myself to go back to sleep and woke up with no more sweat. I should emphasize that when I really wake up like in the morning I do not wake up sweating. Should I be concerned about this given that Ive had them occasionally before probably when I was really stressed out with school and that theyre pretty mild? I dont want to ignore it if it could be a sign of something bad but I want to stop freaking out about it too. Again these are not beddrenching like google says is a problem. Oh and to make things even more annoying I feel like Im coming down with a cold or something... everyone in my school it seems is getting sick. So throw those symptoms together and you have an overly anxious kid. Thanks for any advice.,Anxiety

34160,I feel like my psychologist might be ready to refer me elsewhere I have OCD with a health anxiety emphasis. My worries have run the gamut but I mostly focus on the idea of skin cancer. I have been seeing a psychologist for CBT and while in the sessions everything he says sounds logical and makes perfect sense. However the second I encounter a mole I feel looks suspicious I don't apply what I've learned in therapy and I do everything wrong. I start by googling my symptoms and then when that doesn't work I go to my doctor to seek reassurance. This assuages my fears temporarily but sometimes its not enough until the doctor will agree to a biopsy. Then inevitably the cycle continues.My psychologist has been doing this therapy with me for months and I was doing so well until I tried testing myself and found a new mole. I was definitely not ready for it and this started a downward spiral where I feel like all the progress I made went by the wayside and I was back to how I was in the beginning.Today I had a session after my most recent urgent care amp doctor visit. The tone was a lot different this time and I can tell he's frustrated with me because I am not using his advice. He kept saying I am sorry that I haven't been able to get through to you to help you. and has pointed out that I am not doing the work of not giving into my compulsions. He said that he didn't want to make me go through therapy if I wasn't motivated to do the work to get better. He's totally right. The positive that came out of this is that I am reflecting on my lack of motivation to do what I know I need to do to get better. I feel like I can prove myself to him from this point forward but I don't know that he's willing to continue treating me. Hopefully this next appointment isn't him telling me its the last one. Anyway thank you for reading!,Anxiety
34161,My HIV hypochondria is acting up again Hey guysSo I had been sleeping with this guy Rob on and off since 2016 and around August last year I started to get anxious about his status after stalking his exes facebook. I noticed she had cold sores on her lips and the last time I saw her in 2015 I saw her with cold sores. At first I thought it was normal because lots of people have and get cold sores but when I saw a recent picture of her on Facebook with the same if not worse cold sores. This concerned me because to my knowledge only people who are immuno compromised get recurring cold sores that often. I had spoken to Rob about his status earlier and he assured me he was healthy and I chose to believe him but after speaking to one of my girl friends she was surprised at how quick I was to believe him. She said verbatim guys can lie and I don't trust these uni boys keep in mind I live in Kenya where HIV is prevalent. This comment really freaked me out and I was sure he lied to me. I started freaking out and going crazy because of the picture of his ex coupled with my friend's comments I was sure I had contracted the virus. At this time I started sending him cryptic messages alluding to him infecting me but he didn't get which then forced me to plainly ask Are you HIV positive? He quickly replied No I'm not. I checked you also checked and I went and got tested and my results returned negative this wasn't a rapid test it was the one you wait two days for. I felt so bad about accusing him and we stopped speaking. Skip forward 3 months and we start fucking again. We met up and fucked 2 more times before I officially ended it for good. Now my mind is going back to thoughts that I'm HIV positive again. I keep thinking that maybe the first 6 times we met up and fucked the virus missed me and on the last 7th and 8th time the virus may have stuck. Is that possible? TLDR Had been hooking up with a guy since Dec 2016 and started getting anxious about his HIV status. Got tested in August 2017 and results came back negative. Started fucking him again in October 2017 and stopped in November. Is it possible that he is positive and the virus missed me the first 6 times we fucked and got me the last two times we did it? ,Anxiety
34162,Finger painthrobbing My forefinger keeps throbbing for about 34 seconds then stopping for 34 seconds then throbbing again for 34 seconds this happens like 6 times for about 5 minutes then stops and starts again after a random amount of time I can't really liken any of my activities to triggering it. It is moderately painful doesn't feel like external pain like a scratch or impact of some sort and feels more like a shooting pain in the sense that it feels as though it is rushing up the first segment of my forefinger as it pains me.I am a little worried I have some sort of repetitive strain since I do spend a lot of time on the computer and playing on a Nintendo DS.

34165,Is it normal to get screened for psychosis even though I dont have any symptoms of it??? Ok let me explain what is going on. Hope some of you can relate to this. My anxiety is through the roof.Couple of years back I had stressinduced panic anxiety with all the classic symptoms rapid heartbeat crazy tensions panic attacks fatique etc.. My doctor had a hard time telling me what was going on and I kept coming to the worst conclusions gt this gave me some crazy health anxiety and the fear of dying. I came over this in a year and haven't had any of this for 2 years straight.Now 4 months ago I start to feel a little depressed nothing major I assumed it was due to the winter coming messed up sleeping pattern and life just being a bit boring. This threw me right back into the health anxiety. Thoughts racing constantly about why I got depressed what is happening to me am I going crazy etc. I went to the doctor saying that I felt off a bit emotionally numb and racing thoughts 247. I took a depression test there but kinda showed nothing so the doctor kept asking me questions about hallucinations and delusions which I have had nothing of never. I went back a couple of more times assuming something physical was wrong with me or atleast something crazy that messed with my cognitive abilities. Got the same questions again and again.So I slowly started thinking about the questions what if I am gonna hallucinate see stuff that isnt there etc. Now I am stuck here with some 247 dpdr constant hyperawareness and crazy anxiety about hallucinating or going psychotic or something. It's like my brain is in super defence mode recognizing everything that changes in my surroundings telling me to reality check everything so I am sure that I am not going crazy. I feel so off.I went to my doctor again and told her about the fear of going crazy or developing schizophrenia. And she sent me to a psyciatrist with the reference of me being psychotic. When I read the reference I had a fullblown panic attack I just froze. This made my anxiety 100x worse than before thinking that I must be super crazy.Recently I went to the psyciatrist who asked me the same questions about delusions and halluciations and I described again the same things. That I've never had them never had any delusions. But I am starting to think whenever I see something delusional thoughts pop up in my head because of my obsession about the fear what if I thought someone were actually following me etc.. all kinds of intruisive thoughts that I know for a fact that is no were near real but just scary that that they pop up in my head all the damn time. I used some metaphors there at the interview and I think she might have gotten the totally wrong idea of what I told her. Because now I am being sent off to an interview about schizophrenia and psychosis because she thinks I am that apparently even though I don't have any symptoms at all. She even gave me a temporary diagnosis as a schizophrenic wtf.This is throwing me off what the f is happening. Am I losing control I can't believe this is happening. Is this normal to get screened for??? I feel so detatched right now stuck in full blown overanalyzing mode of my surroundings I can't relax. What if I am going schizophrenic or psycotic????Sorry for my grammar my anxiety has never been worse.,Anxiety
34166,Can 247 anxiety cause brainTumor like symptoms? 19Yo male here I eat really healthy and exercise regularly everyday just to preface. I've always suffered from severe anxiety particularly health anxiety and depressionto less of an extent I remember at 12 the fear of testicular cancer just plaguing my every thought for months because of a dull ache in my testes.Anyway just before i started university for the first time a friend died of brain cancer and all of my close friends' moms died of breast cancer when I was young so I have a warped perception of how common it is I guess. Aside from this my life has been filled with death my father is terminally Ill my mum was suicidal and almost died of blood poisoning my grandma had vascular dementia and we cared for her at home until her death more beyond this grandparents friends' parents uncles and aunts.My anxiety since starting uni has worsened I suffer an elevated heart rate and sweats 247 extreme worrying thoughts all the time trembling hands especially bad at night. I've not had any memory issues or coordination issues it's literally just headaches for the past few weeks I've been getting pain in very singular spots never a full over generalised headache it lasts for a few seconds to a minute and then disappears and this happens a few times through the day. The kicker is if I CAN remove myself from my anxiety it doesn't really happen I was shopping all of yesterday with my girlfriend and didnt have any issues at all until we got into a quiet taxi at which point my thoughts went rampant.I just feel like my anxiety is killing me and it's really spearheaded into this fear of a tumor. I sleep awfully too because of my anxiety and grind my teeth severely as well as holding my shoulders up and tight all the time. EVERY rational part of me says it's all a mental thing but I cannot get that rational part of my brain to win over I'm in constant states of terror and get these huge adrenaline rushes physically crashing over me daily.Should I see a doctor? Should I be hugely worried from the point of view of a Tumour? I've finally after years managed to bring myself to see a therapist I start next week I've just always felt myself as being a drama queen but my life isn't even enjoyable anymore I'm so sickly worried all the time.

34169,Sharp headache everytime I move or cough Figured I could come here for enlightenment since I'm currently kind of on holiday. I'm 23 female and about a month ago I contracted one of the worst flus I'd ever experienced in my life in fact I'm pretty sure I've never gotten any kind of flu before this one I'm almost never sick. I only fully recovered about a week or two ago and I've noticed for the past few days a sharp pain on the top of my head everytime I cough or movechange elevation. I figured it may be because I've been sleeping a lot and not drinking enough water perhaps but I don't know. I took a pain killer a few days ago for the same kind of headache but it didn't help. Naps make it go away but not fully I can still feel some kind of pressurelight pain when coughing and moving. I'm also currently on my period which started a few days ago. Not sure if there's any correlation. Is this normal after a flu and a somewhat consistent cough? I haven't really gotten out of the house much the last couple of days either. Maybe I should?One notable thing in my medical history that I still have I believe is iron deficiency. Not sure if that could also be a testament to whatever this is.,Anxiety
34170,Wheezing constricted airways after exercising in the cold I've been doing the Couchto5K running program for about a month. It's been in the 40s and 50s a lot lately when I go running. I'm able to complete my runs fine but I notice after getting home that the deepest parts of my lungs feel tight or constricted. I can force a deep breath but when I do I hear this wheezing like the airways are stretching back open. Usually after about 30 60 min or so it's back to normal.I tried wearing a neck gaiter after the first time and it got a lot better but was still there. I went to the doctor and described all this and he listened to my lungs. He said my lungs sounded perfect. And that it's normal to have that wheezing after exercising in the cold since your airways constrict and forcing them open creates a spasm that makes that wheezing sound. He also said as long as it's only that and not actual shortness of breath then it's nothing to worry about and to continue running preferably when it stops being cold.Anyway just wondering if anyone else can relate to this or can offer any other support. It is an irrational thing at this point since I've been to the doctor and described exactly what was going on to him. Knowing the way my anxiety works I suspect the reasons I haven't dropped it are that he didn't hear it actually doing it and to me it sounds strange and that I secretly worry it's a small start to a bigger lung issue I've had a couple relatives pass away after getting pulmonary fibrosis which definitely is in my head when anything lungrelated is going on. Any tips or other support would be fantastic!PS I refuse to google it or anything else for that matter but if anyone has support for pulmonary fibrosis worries that would help too. I believe for my relatives that started with gradually dropping oxygen levels and some strange sounds the doctors could hear in their breathing. So nothing like what I'm describing here .. if only health anxiety used the rational side of the brain!,Anxiety

I noticed rodent droppings on the floor. I didn't mess with them at all but I did definitely breathe while I was in there. Does anyone have any understand of hantavirus on a deeper level? I know it is extremely rare and caused by kicking up dust that has been contaminated. But what are the odds that I get hantavirus assuming the mouse excrement in that closet was even infectious?

About every month something feels wrong with me and I freak out.

34177,Scared about temporal arteritis Adding to all the cancers and heart conditions I've been worried about I just read about temporal arteritis and I'm worried about it too. I'm a 23 year old white male. For the past couple days I've had tenderness near my right temple only. There's no constant pain but it hurts when I put mild to moderate pressure on a certain part of the bone behindunder the temple. I can feel a slight bump there but there's an essentially symmetrical one on the other side with no tenderness with the same amount of pressure. I do have many other symptoms of temporal arteritis including frequent headaches although generally mild tiredness in limbs and general tiredness but I've had all that for a long time and often can be traced to specific causes like poor sleeping habits and dehydration. I don't have any of the jaw pain or tiredness any more so than I would normally get after chewing for a long time anyway although sometimes my mouth does feel slightly stiff if I haven't opened it for a while. I do have a bad habit of clenchinggrinding my teeth that I've had for most of my life and I've had TMJassociated pain before. I don't think I've had any vision loss but sometimes I do find it harder to focus or I feel like I'm not seeing quite as well when I' tired so I can't say for sure. I don't have any other tender points on my scalp just the right temple.,Anxiety

34184,Anxiety or genuine heart condition? For the past year or so I have had crippling health anxiety with it all being related to my heart. The anxiety comes in waves and is usually when I am on my own and not keeping myself busy. The symptoms are so raw and debilitating that I sometimes genuinely think I have a undiagnosed heart condition. Common symptoms include the following Floatingsinking chest feeling Sudden twinges and sharp pierces that go after 12 seconds Increase in heart rate Cold shivers Restlessness have to get up and walk around Panic attacks Strange tingling an aching that is always on the left side of chest and resonates to left arm and shoulder blade Dizzinesslightheadednesss I have recently taken up running as a form of exercise three times a week to aid in the alleviation of these symptoms. More often than not this gives miraculous results and I feel fantastic after every run. Occasionally however the anxiety kicks in half way through the run and it is a real struggle to continue. Afterwards I have to sit down and try not to panic and think that my heart is going to give out on me. Is there anything I can do to combat this anxiety? I am planning to get a blood test and ECG done just to rule out any conditions. I am a 22 yo male with no family history of heart conditions. I have lightly smoked on and off between the ages of 1821 but quit around 4 months ago. Any help would be appreciated ,Anxiety

I could see it for ten minutes or so. And its pretty much gone but it feels like Ive lost some center focus. Can this repair itself or have I permanent vision damage now ?Ill go see a doctor tomorrow. Just wonder if anyone has tried something like that.

34192,DAE get anxiety from medication side effects like drowsiness? So latest health crisis was a fear that i had a kidney infection. my only symptom started last Wednesday with severe lower back pain and my whole back started to feel tense because well i don't know why. Its like i was being very careful not to strain the parts that hurt and as a result tensed up everything else. lower back was even spasming and i thought for sure kidney. after that thought won i started getting chills and teeth chattered this happens when i am terrified during panic attacks too. so last thursday headed straight to my dr. they did not find an infection but saw a little bit of WBC in my urine so they loaded me with antibiotics muscle relaxers and a shot of toradol. and prednisone for inflammation. NO fever nothing just intense anxiety and lower back pain. I lift weights and mostly do glute work and increased weights last week plus i wear super high heels. anyway the pain has lessened but 1 i didn't take the prednisone but today i felt my back tight and painful again so I took HALF a muscle relaxer bc i don't like the out of control drowsiness that it causes. This is the first time ive ever taken one. but i looked up side effects. anyway i took the half at 2 and i feel so sleepy but like scared to sleep. my anxiety has been at a 7 every since i took it. I don't know why? maybe the lack of control or the fear that ill have a bad reaction??,Anxiety

34198,Skin on back and arms feels like it's burning? Hello all. I'm new to the subreddit but I wanted to see if anyone could help put my mind at ease. For the last couple of months my mom's health has not been the best.To make things worse I've been smoking weed and it's pretty much been giving me panic attacks everyday. I stopped smoking weed a couple days ago to see if it would help. Anyways In the beginning of last week she was admitted to the hospital and among other things it really stressed me out. That Monday I woke up in the middle of the night sweating hungry and cold. I was pacing back and forth and I started googling my symptoms I know bad idea and I came across peripheral neuropathy. I googled the causes of that MS was one of the results and I started to freak out. I googled relentlessly for the next week because the burning on my back and arms has not stopped since and it's put all my senses on high alert. I also feel like cold electricity going up the back of my head I I'ven really anxious ever since and it's started to affect me. I went to the hospital and got a CT scan on my neck and they found nothing. I read online that one of the ways to diagnose MS was to do an MRI of the brain and spine to look for lesions so I'm not surprised that the CT scan came back clear. I haven't been back to the hospital but the symptoms just haven't stopped. Now I'm also getting twitches all over and my muscles feel weak but I think that's just the anxiety playing tricks on me. I went to the doctor this morning and explained to her all my symptoms. She did some basic strength tests and she told me that the burning skin can be a symptom of anxiety. I've also googled burning skin and anxiety can cause that but it still hasn't really made me feel better. I had some blood work done and she prescribed me muscle relaxers and an antidepressant and told me to come back in 3 weeks. Could all my symptoms really just be from anxiety? The burning also at times can feel like my skin is cold but when I touch it it's not. I have noticed that my symptoms do go down a bit if I calm down a bit. Anyone else experience something similar? ,Anxiety

It doesnt change from one side to the other like typical congestion. Ive used some oxymethoziline and zicam but the top part of my nostril is still clogged. It feels like somethings stuck in there. Ive used my neti pot 34 times since then but nothing comes out. No mucus no pressure just a nagging swelling.Is this just a common cold coming on? Nasal Polyps? I really dont wanna go see an ENT because I just saw one 34 months ago for allergies and they said my sinuses were healthy.If I lift up my nose and look inside it seems like the top of my nostril is more swollen on one side then the other.,Anxiety
34201,Struggling with fear of breast cancer after seeing multiple doctors. Feeling lost. Hello everyone! This sub has been a great source of comfort for me for quite some time now. I have never felt the need to post until today as the last month has been very hard on me and I'm hoping someone will have some ideas on how I can combat my extreme health anxiety.As a preface Im a 24 year old woman.About a month ago I felt a giant white welt under my left breast. The next day it was no longer raised completely but there was a slight bump like a pimple or a bug bite but there was no 'peak'. It was red in the area about the size of a quarter. No pain no itching. I don't think I would have noticed it if I hadn't felt it. I have always struggled with health anxiety but for the past 6 months it has been pretty dormant. Then I googled 'bug bite on breast' and everything spiraled from there.I stumbled upon Inflammatory Breast Cancer and am now convinced that I have it. I read multiple stories about how it is commonly misdiagnosed as a bugbite my doctor said it was a bug bite when I went in. This made my anxiety worse. So I saw another doctor at the family practice I go to. She wasn't sure what it was it could be a pimpleskin irritation and told me if it was still there in 2 weeks she would send me to a breast specialist.I made an appointment with a breast specialist on my own because I could not bear the wait. He looked at it and told me it is most likely just a skin irritation from my bra or a clogged pore that is taking a while to heal. Said if it didn't go away in another 23 weeks that he would send me for an ultrasound but he really didnt think it was anything to worry about.Again this was not enough for me. I made an appointment with my OBGYN and he looked at it and echoed the same sentiment the other doctors did. It is nothing whatever it was is on its way to healing. But he would send me for an ultrasound to set my mind at ease.I got the ultrasound yesterday and they didnt find anything. They said there is a chance it was a tiny cyst that is now almost gone that it is undetectable on the machine. This should have made me feel better but I read online that IBC is very hard to detect on ultrasounds. If it didnt go away in two weeks the radiologist told me I should see a dermatologist because it seems to be more of a skin issue. That day I called to make an appointment with a derm because I know it takes time to get in to see them. Funnily enough they had a cancellation that day and asked if I wanted to come in that afternoon. Of course I said yes. When I was there I explained my issues. The derm looked at it and again said the same thing everyone else did. Its most likely just a skin irritation and she gave me the option of waiting to see if it goes away on its own within 23 months or she could do a shave biopsy. I of course opted for the biopsy.Then I got home and did more research and found out IBC is usually only diagnosed through a punch biopsy. The biopsy I got at the derm will not be deep enough to diagnose that even if it is there.I cannot catch my breath and am struggling to function like a normal human being. Its much more likely that the spot under my breast is just what everyone says it is an irritation!!! IBC is SO rare especially for someone my age but its the deadliness of the disease that is haunting my every move. I am so terrified of death and of dying young and leaving behind everyone I love.I am on 10mg Buspar and have been for only a month now. The side effects are crippling me. I am only sleeping 34 hours a night Im having horrible nightmares dizziness headaches. I am not eating and have lost 15 pounds this month because of it. I cry hysterically almost every night. I obsessively check my boobs whether that is starting at them in the mirror or prodding them or comparing them the left one is bigger than the right always has been but my health anxiety makes me wonder if it really has always been this way.Every new spot I discover or mark or freckle sends me into extreme panic. Im struggling to meet deadlines at work. Im letting my house go to shit. I just started therapy last week so I am hoping that eventually starts to kick in and help as well.I guess what Im looking for is advice on how to calm my nerves. How to function like a normal human being. Im so depressed. Im missing out on so much. Any words of advice would be so appreciated.,Anxiety

Ive always been able to keep it under control but after having a near death experience in my teens my anxious nature has been directed towards my health. For the past 9 months Ive been experience various symptoms consisting of brain fog muscle twitches all over my body. sharp nerve pain that seems to come and go affecting everything from my legs to my wrist and fingers. muscle buzzing primarily in the feet feels like a cell phone going off under my foot. This worry of ether a neurological disease or a serious infection such as Lyme seems to dominate most of my days. I constantly make the mistake of self diagnosing using discussion posts of users on various sites with similar issues and I realize its a recipe for unhappiness. This type of worry feels at times like an addiction that I simply cannot stop coming back to.I live an incredibly charmed life with an amazing family and incredible fianc. And I realize Im not hard done by in the traditional sense. But this anxiety surrounding my health is something Im desperate to manage but more importantly be done with. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated and THANK YOU so much for taking the time out of your day to read this. ,Anxiety
34216,Think Before You Post why reassurance seeking might be feeding your health anxiety. Hey rhealthanxiety Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive. So you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains heart palpitations stomach problems poop problems any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about. You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out but doubt their opinion.All of these have happened to me and happen to many many other HA sufferers which is completely okay. However the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.Usually what I would do is post here explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.All of this felt like what I had to do a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine. In the short term yes it made me feel better but this was only short lived.This might also account for medical tests I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT colonoscopy or endoscopy or whatever it might be would make all their worries go away. Which after the short term relief the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety I speak from experience.One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.So if you don't seek that reassurance what's going to happen? For me at first it was unbareable anxiety and just an extreme desire to check I was okay whether that was through posting to the subreddit the discord asking family checking my body for lumps checking my lymph nodes etc. You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance do something mindful something genuinely healthy for the mind. As when in a very high anxiety situation sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future. You can do many things for me it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else not an easy task by any means but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance. You could possibly try meditation though if you don't regularly practice it it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels. You could try relaxing music your favourite food anything else that enhances your mood whatever works for you. During this time you will experience anxiety potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance but I promise you in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.When you seek reassurance you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately because usually it feels like the right thing and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me try not seeking it.It'll be very similar to this graphhttpsthegirlwiththecurlyhair.co.ukwpcontentuploads201512anxietyrepeatedexposuregraph.png the more you do it the easier it'll be. And it might get to the point where the anxiety almost completely goes after a while of practicing this. Seriously it is worth definitely giving a go and thinking about this if you're currently having a lot of anxiety I've been there hundreds of times and applying this mentality was one of the key turning points into recovering from health anxiety. ,Anxiety
34217,Health anxiety is a vicious circle. Not sure if anyone has this but my health anxiety can fixate around my vision. Thus becoming a vicious circle of worrying about my vision which makes it worse which in turn I then worry about...so on and so forth.Been to the opticians on numerous occasions yet it always seems to come back on random occasions...Fucking sucks.,Anxiety
34218,180 on Health Concerns For a few months I had headaches several times a day and thought nothing of it. I mentioned it in passing to my husband who insisted I go to a doctor. Long story short I was diagnosed with a pituitary tumor. Very easy treatment and no major concerns with it. The twist is the medicine I take for it has a side effect of increasing anxiety. For me this has manifested into Health Anxieties and 99.9 of the time at night when Im trying to sleep. Ill feel a pain in my leg or think I have an elevated heart rate or or or etc. I hate that Ive gone 180 from being so passive to now fearful or obsessive. Has anyone else had a diagnosis trigger their anxiety? ,Anxiety
34219,Loss of appetite for over a month I believe I got the flu right on Christmas Day most likely caused by eating extremely spicy popcorn which I have been eating somewhat frequently prior. Went to the ER about 4 days after and got nothing but laughs from the doctor saying there's nothing wrong. Been eating nothing but rice porridge and shredded pork for over a week. I could hold food down but have completely lost the urge to eat since would occasionally eat out to try and care for my hunger pangs that I think I was having. At first it was difficult to eat or even will myself to eat got better then got worse again. At this point I could hardly eat and have to seriously think about whether or not I am hungry since it's seemingly impossible to tell when it was as easy as a stomach growl before then. 56 days ago I think I got food poisoning now I absolutely can't eat anything. Got the flu shot maybe 2 days prior and things only seemed to get worse then. Would often puke but wouldn't see food come back out mostly what looked like saliva had nothing but rice porridge after all. Went to the doctor's office and was prescribed Ranitidine the medication may have cause this sense of looming nervousness but it's most likely just me since I've been fine with it every other time after about the second day of taking it or so. Decided that it was now necessary to force feed myself to jumpstart my appetite along with light walking 12 miles after each meal or so I wasn't physically active at all prior worse since I was bedridden during the flu. I fear that I'm overeating when I've been told to eat 56 small meals each day I've also grown terribly impatient with my recovery seeing as how this has been going on for over a month. I would often feel incredibly miserable and every day I was plagued with anxiety until I decided to force feed myself I don't care about getting fat anymore I just want my appetite back but now I'm starting to fear that I'm going about this the wrong way. The feelings of hopelessness and anxiety have hardly gotten better and while I don't suspect my loss of appetite is due to my anxiety I can never be too sure. The whole reason why I even had anxiety in the first place was because of how sudden my loss of appetite was and how I was unable to self diagnose myself since I felt no abdominal pain whatsoever I'm at a loss as to what's going on with my body. ,Anxiety
34220,Terrified of heart disease Ever since I learned that heart attacks are preceded by jaw and arm pain I've been walking around in a state of constant paranoia. Because I have asthma chest pain tightness is something I like with daily so throw these things together and you have a recipe for an anxious mess. Eating is a nightmare. Every time I eat something even mildly unhealthy handful of salted peanuts for example I can feel the sodium and cholesterol in my chest coursing through my veins around my heart. I know that I'm just being anxious but damn if it doesn't wig me the hell out.I got an EKG last summer and multiple CT scans including one in December none of which have indicated heart problems. My blood pressure's a little high but other than that I'm technically fine. I know that everyone else on this sub deals with this but damn does it suck.,Anxiety
34221,Psychiatrist wants me to get a blood test She says it could show the levels of medication in my blood and if it's effective etc. And if I have a thyroid disorder or diabetes or vitamin deficiency or some other physical reason for my depression and anxiety. Yeah it makes perfect sense to get the blood test.But I swear to God I just don't think I can do it. I am so sure something serious will be wrong with me and I just don't think I can handle it. Last time I had a blood test I fainted when I heard the results which weren't actually bad in any way. Just thinking about it has had me depressed and anxious and crying for days now. I'm not afraid of needles but I can't imagine going to the doctor for the blood test let alone waiting for days for the results. I just don't think I can do it. I don't want to do it even though I know it's objectively a good idea.I'm seriously considering just... not seeing this psychiatrist anymore. I guess I could eventually find one who doesn't demand blood tests.I don't know what I'm asking for here. Advice if you have it but if not can anyone relate?,Anxiety
34222,Woken by leg cramp DVT? I'm a really anxious person and once something goes wrong I instantly think of all the worst things it could be and start to freak out.Not too long ago I was suddenly awoken by a severe cramp in my right calf. I've got it stuck in my head that it could be DVT. My legs arent swollen red or discolored. The pain was pretty intense but only lasted a few moments or so less than a minuteDoes the pain usually last longer and not go away? It's still sore and hard to walk on but not nearly as bad as when I woke.Also I have severe panic attacks at doctors lol. Which is a good combo with the worries of always dying. ,Anxiety
34223,I have very annoying intrusiveobsessive thoughts I didnt know where to turn so here I am. For starters Im not diagnosed with any anxiety disorder or other mental health illness. Its not always as bad as it has been for the past few days but its already annoying me so much. Its like I cant relax my mind and the biggest issue for me is watching my current TV show. I know it sounds dumb but its what i love doing the most and what makes it easier to get through the day. Its like these annoying thoughts keep getting in the way and I cant enjoy watching my stuff. For instance Im up next to solve an exercise in math class on tuesday in front of the class and its not for a grade or anything but my brain keeps telling me that I wont be able to relax until i complete that and I wish my turn was on friday so i could enjoy the weekend. I dont know how to clear my mind so i can get into whats happening in my TV show and truly enjoy it like I normally do. I would appreciate any suggestions if you understandcan relate to what Im going through atm.,Anxiety
34224,So my fears have been confirmed. Wednesday I went camping and ended up sleeping in 30 degree weather was ill prepared to say the least. Ended up getting 2 hours of sleep while shivering the entire time. So Thursday night I suddenly came down with the chills and a brutal headache. Yesterday I went to urgent care and there they confirmed I have the flu type A virus and a 102 feveras a hypochondriac this immediately kicked in my catastrophic thinking and always fearing the worst. They gave me Tamiflu which cost a pretty penny. Today I feel like dogshitaches pains coughing but my fever has seemed to drop. But Ive been sleeping like shit no more than 5 a night dont ya need to sleep to get rid of this?Im an extremely healthy person so being out of commission like this is literal hell lol. Is anyone else dealing with the flu? Any tips? Also Im going to be couch ridden while the misses is working so casual convo is welcomed. ,Anxiety
34225,What's causing my confusiondelerium 22MI've been feeling very confuseddelirious since Sunday night. Let me give a little backstory about the events that lead up to thisI've been in terrible pain from a root canal for about a week before this happened every day I took about 4000mg of extra strength Tylenol and 20002400 mg of Advil liquigels until Sunday night I don't smoke weed often. Maybe once a week or so since last September but I did on Sunday night. Not anything more than I usually do or even a different strain but the night I smoked is the night I stopped taking my pain meds but it's Friday night now and I feel confused and just overall off like I'm watching myself through a glass pane. Does anyone have any advice that could help me. This feeling is causing me to have daily panic attacks,Anxiety
34226,Someone please help First of all I urge anyone who reads this to please give an opinion on what they think it may be I'm worried sick. Thanks in advance.Ok i've made posts about things I've felt before but somehow everything I had 2 weeks ago is now gone and has been replaced by new fears.I'll get straight to it here are symptoms with context Odd feeling on left side of body mainly legs only when laying or sitting. Feels like weakness but I can still walk just fine and feel no difference in balance. Sort of like fatigue without any actual excercise to cause it really odd and it scares me. Tinnitus already diagnosed 2 years ago with bilateral tinnitus and it's got easier to deal with. But in times like these it makes me feel awful. I'm aware of the recent progresses in Tinnitus treatment so it doesn't worry me too much as it's benign and only sounds when i'm in silence. Constipation probably caused by the stress or anxiety. Either way it might be causing me problems. Intermittent sharp stomach pains on the left side of my abdomen under ribs I called the doctor about it and he said it was nothing lethal or worrying but to get it checked out anyway. That my current worst fear that I had a digestive infection caused by the constipation. A feeling that for some reason I'm going to die tomorrow from some lethal random attack of sorts like my intestines will rupture from a tiny stomach pain or that I'll have a heart attack because I can sometimes hear pounding in my head. That's the worst of all of this the never being able to relax I feel on edge 247. Researching everything that I can in order to reassure myself only to find an even worse disease that vaguely correlates to my symptoms.I always feel the urge to check my speech to see if it's slurred or check my heartrate to check for palpitations or check my typing to check for strokeALS. I seriously can't keep living like this why do I keep getting these physical symptoms?!Many thanks Max,Anxiety
34227,HIV worry Hi thereAbout a month ago I had unprotected sex with my ex girlfriend we have still maintained a close friendship. She told me she had been tested for STDs since the last time she had sex I had had blood work and urine work done since the last time I had had sex also. About a week later she told me she had missed her period and we were worried about pregnancy. She was sick for a few days nauseous and fatigued. After a while she got better but during that time I asked if she had blood work done to which she replied no just urine. She thought the same negative thoughts as me she also has health anxiety. When she got better she assured me that she had just been stressed not eating right and I had nothing to worry about. She even called me to reassure me.Now I am studying abroad in the Middle East and I started feeling sick last week. I had a stomach ache normal for new bacteria in food and then a sore throat and congestion. Instantly I thought this was the worst and that I had HIV. Again I told her I was freaking out but she reassured me that I was fine and so was she. I found out that my friend in the program has had the same symptoms as me and we guessed it was allergies.Now Ive been taking antihistamines and feel better but the thought wont leave my mind. I understand that its very hard to get anything through vaginal intercourse plus I am circumcised 0.08 that she has it 0.04 chance that I could get it from her if she was . Its hard to get tested in the country Im in because thats simply how it is. Ive asked her to get tested but she said shes been very busy and she told me I need to get help for my anxiety. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist because I have a history of panicking and anxiety. Should I be worried about this?Thanks and sorry for long read.,Anxiety
34228,Superbowl parties and the flu I was going to go to a superbowl party today but then I remembered the flu season is at its peak. I'm also having surgery the day after on Monday and while I know that symptoms don't usually appear until a couple days after being infected it would really suck if I got the flu while I was recovering from surgery. I don't care about football tbh but I love going to superbowl parties to stuff my face with food. I got the vaccince but apparently it's really ineffective this year so I'm still worried about catching it even if I'm super careful.

34231,Up and down So my health anxiety focuses on getting pregnant Im terrified of it dont ever want to be Im 20 and no doctor will tie my tubes. I thought either my contraceptive implant was broken i would do pregnancy tests and not trust the result or go digging through the bin for them I didnt trust a blood test I thought every twinge in my body was a symptom. I thought I saw signs everywhere telling me I was pregnant.Then last week after 3 CBT sessions upping my anti depressants and travelling home to see my parents for the first time in 4 weeks I had the first good week since September. No tests no doctor visits plenty of exercise could snap myself out of any dangerous thought patterns. No googling! I was so happy and proud. I even had sex for the first time in 4 months with my boyfriend. Then on Saturday morning my boyfriend accidentally grabbed my arm implant. Since then I feel like Ive spiralled back of control after just one week of happiness. Ive resisted doing a test so far but I swear my implant is broken even after seeing a nurse Im symptom spotting googling crying etc. My techniques to cope arent working. I go from feeling scared and upset to angry with myself and the world.I was just wondering how do people cope with these type of set backs? How do you pull yourself up again? At the minute I just feel sad and depressed and angry. Fuck you health anxiety.,Anxiety

34234,Fear of getting schizophrenia or any mental illness So my psychologist told me I have gad with obsessive thoughts that are health related. Im very scared of getting schizophrenia yesterday I had a very vivid dream of two people at my school dying. And it felt so real in the dream I passed by a house in a car and two bodies were there and I was crying hard in the dream. I woke up all scared . And I heard a symptom of getting schizophrenia is believing your dreams or something . I havent looked up my symptoms in 2 months and I never will . I know all of this is irrational but Im scared . My psychologist told me that its just anxiety and that I dont have schizophrenia and that Im not developing it. He said hes seen many patients with that illness and Im not like them. Sometimes I have paranoid thoughts when Im in my mind but I know theyre irrational.,Anxiety

34236,I'm afraid I have breast cancer in my 20s But I don't know if it's just paranoia anxiety or my period. My period's never caused this before. A few days before my period started one of my nips was hurting really bad and it kinda kept me awake for a bit then my breast in general was hurting. It went away after a day but now a week later it's happening again. Could it be breast cancer even though I'm 22? How do they even test for breast cancer? I don't know if I'd even qualify for getting a mammogram. I'm not sure if I still even have insurance. Also relevant I've always had a lump in one of my breasts ever since I was like 18. But it never worried me because I was so young and google said it was probably nothing. And it's been four years since I discovered it and it never killed me. What if though??? I'm definitely not pregnant so it isn't that.,Anxiety
34237,How do you stop fuzzing? My friend is as healthy as can be but eversince I started really knowing him there's been something wrong. He'd go to the doctor clear up whatever condition he thought he had and then he'll go home and start googling every single aspect of his bodily functions. For example Smelling burning wood then he thinks obviously something is wrong with his nose now?? Until eventually he discovers some other condition he may have. Then he stresses it until a doctor clears it up again and then repeat. He would sit for hours up at night reading symptoms and unfortunately that is not exaggeration.He's never fine never normal never healthy in his mind. And as much as it annoys me its worrisome. Because there's no helping a person that always thinks that he knows better.I'm looking for someone who can advise him on how you coped or even escaped this state of mind. But any advice would be appreciated.Thanks.,Anxiety

34239,Heart anxiety pvc vt and cpvt Hi there. I want to begin to tell you that I have suffer from health anxiety for few years. I was actually good for 3 years until 10 weeks ago. Last two years I've had skipped beats. Doctor told me it was probably pvc and did no test. I believed him and continued with my life. These skipped beats would happened when in rest so I wasn't worried. Last year I had a hernia surgery and I couldn't run for 4 month's. Then last summer I noticed when I started running that my heart would skip beats or flutter more frequently during excersice. Sometimes just 12 times but sometimes 10 times. I saw a cardiologist and he did ECG echo stress test. My heart is structurally normal and everything looks fine except 1 pvc during stress test. I didn't have any anxiety and continue working out. Than 10 weeks ago I was running. I'm not in good shape because I'm scared of exercising. Everything went fine until I had pvc. I continued running and got few in a row! my heart started pumping and I felt numbness and my heart was getting pvc A LOT. I thought I was going to faint but I didn't. My friend called the ambulance. I freaked out When they came my pvc had stop and I just had 150 bpm. ECG showed nothing. Had a blood test as we'll and 2 more ECG which showed nothing. Docs told me nothing to worry about. I was fine until week ago when I was watching tv and relaxing. I noticed chest tingling. I took my pulse and it was fast. I had a panic attack and skipped beats few in a row. I called a ambulance and they did ECG 2x and there we're no sign of anything. My skipped beats were not happening when they came. I had a holter and I'm waiting for the results but it only captured skip bear while at rest. I'm trying to get on with my life but I can't take this anymore. I'm so anxious. Deep down in my heart I worry so much that I have Venticular tachardia because of those skipped beats while excsersising or panic attacks. They came more than 3 in a row and that is suppose to be a bad sign. I want to believe my doctors but I can't get it out of my head that they have never capatured my heart fast and inregular at the same time. Only pvc or fast sinus rate. I'm can't sleep I can't enjoy anything and I'm have been a mess last week's because of this Venticular tachardia anxiety. summary. I've experience at least two times fast rate and skipped beats. It also happened one time when I had adrenaline rush because of a bad family fight. My heart started skipping beats alot and sometimes even during dramatic sport events my heart races with skipped beats. It happens if I have adrenaline if I'm excsersising and panic attacks and stress.Also sometimes when drinking alcohol I'm 24 year old 90 kg 185 cm never smoked have panic attacks and health anxiety. Should I worry that they have never capture my heart going fast and skipping beats? Any advice? be honest.I had few good weeks with my anxiety but then googled some shit and found CPVT and it's giving me one helluva anxiety.Im just playing everything in my head. I get more skipped beats when my heart is racing curing excersice or panic.I have had ECG when it happened but my pvc had stopped already and it only showed sinus tachardia.I just want to stop think about this. Deep down I know I'm 99 all right but my brain keeps getting what if especially with cpvt fear. ,Anxiety
34240,Should I see a neurologist? I am 19F and have GAD btw Went to a specialist diagnosed me with occipital neuralgia. i ate the medicine and i no longer get these constant headaches. He did a physical check on me to check my vision balance and muscle strength and it was fine. He told me to just fix my posture. However my muscle twitching and numbness ive always had this my entire life and my short term memory loss problems got worse. Besides i now have speech and focusing problems. Is it just anxiety and it's all just psycho symptomatic pain? Is my recently diagnosed anxiety a symptom of something bigger?,Anxiety
34241,Pretty bad anxiety towards taking meds with a possibility to prolong QT. Help. Warning this post got much MUCH longe r than I anticipated. Sorry to however actually reads this entire essay.So I have a psychiatrist who recently prescribed me sertraline for chronic depressionptsd and trazodone for sleep but I actually haven't taken either. This specific phobia started like 11 12 yrs ago I think. I had walking pneumonia a few weeks ago and absolutely had to take antibiotics and Holy shit my anxiety was thru the roof every time I was time to take it. I was absolutely convinced my QT interval was significantly prolonged and I was going to die in my sleep! I feel like I narrowly escaped death after I finished the course. Which is ridiculous.I have had ekgs countless times probably like over 10 times ftr I'm only 18 and only started getting them in the last two years and for the most part were completely 100 normal shocker.... excluding this one time during my purging like 3x a day and keeping literally nothing down phase where my hearts repolarization phase fucked beyond belief.Actually I'm just going to talk about that a little because the anxiety still plagues me. my heart was physically rattling shaking in my chest with every beat like it was unsure of how to beat normally. it was incredibly scary I think I experienced what I believe was possibly a very brief arrhythmia. at first I thought it may have been a minor seizure which wouldn't be that unrealistic as purging electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia. sleep deprivation I had stayed up all night physical activity while literally running on empty we were inside playing basketball when it all started and of course hypoglycemia essentially noteating will do that to ya all lower the seizure threshold and also how i might have had a seizure once back when I was abusing dxm constantly which of course predisposes you to future seizures because of how disoriented I got and how everything became slow motion almost similar to the time distortion one would get on a psychedelic.......but that didn't explain how my heart rate was reaching 140 for the record throughout the last 2ish years that I have been measuring it it has always always sat at a comfy 5560 while not using HRraising drugs such as dxm or speed when I got it taken in the nurses office in the psychiatric facility and how I felt like I was about to die. When I went and got that ekg I believe actually traumatized me in a way. Coming fairly close to death which has actually happened to me a numerous times with my purging phase over exercising phase I actually kept a fucking exercise bike in my tiny ass room and legit would use it non stop for 35 hours to burn off literally everything I ate and then some feeling proud when my net calories for the day ended up in the negative. it was bad real bad restriction phase I have eaten less than 500 calories day for months at a time several times in fact I can feel a restriction phase coming on as I am pushing myself to not eat God I hate being eating disordered but st this point it's a safety blanket after I've been dealing with this shit day n day out since 13 yrs old me first decided to eat like 100 calories a day for 2 or 3 months can't rmmbr cos I was obese. Cant really remember if I started out with disordered thinking and intentions or if it just was a crash dietturned weird obsession and addiction to weight loss. and also this one non eating disorder related time I was riding in a car with my mom maybe 1 12 years ago legit almost got tboned we would have been hit on myher side of the car had we been just 2 seconds slower getting through the intersection that person would have hit us. oddly enough she was panicking yet I f elt absolutely nothing no adrenaline no fear nothing. I attribute that to how I learned to dissociate from everything at. A young age due to my father's husband abusing us constantly lol dissociation as a coping mechanism is cool notI wholeheartedly believe I could have died if I continued with the purging I still get extreme anxiety when I analyze that specific ekg I know I should throw it out but I just can't I am a person who is very much into record keeping. I feel like I am not actually alive that I died months years ago and this is maybe purgatory. I alternate between genuinely feeling like I should truly not be am not actually alive because of all of this shit. Not sure if that's connected to the ptsd or what. I mean I was dxd with major depressive disorder with psychotic features at one point. God my life is a nightmare. I so desperately wish to take the place of a normal person Ie didn't have an abusive biological father isn't a piece of shit drug addict doesn't harm themselves via eating habits and excessive exercise doesn't have all these stupid ridiculous mental things. how did my life end up like this....... I fantasize about it alot. Normal people with normal lives take that shit for granted. It angers me. They just don't understand how goddamn lucky they fucking are Holy fucking shit. Oops sorry for the going off on a total tangent. That happens to me sometimes.Anyway...How do I get over this.... I honestly would not take any med like that on a daily basis unless I had an at home ekg that I could use like 12 times a day. Actually every time I discontinued an Ssri or antipsychotic it as because I could sense that my QT interval was prolonged. Even if the drug was helping me. It's horrible. I have a cardiologist appointment soon because I got minor chest pains during exercise a few weeks ago. Which doesn't sound particularly bad but that coupled with the knowledge of the fact that many people can have silent heart attacks and asymptomatic arrhythmias it's downright terrifying. I am scared about what I might find out if I mayhaps did permanent structural unfixable damage to my heart muscle from a only a several month long bulimic episode and am now much much more vulnerable to cardiac events.... I almost don't want to go. Now what's weird about this phobia is that I currently am using Xanax at night and meth during the day and I'm also a smoker. Its weird how those three things are pretty notgood for you yet I have less anxiety about smoking a cig or a bowl of meth than taking an anti depressant???!???It's so irrational and honestly I believe it's an ocd thing as I also tend to take my blood pressure 420 times a day no fucking joke and weigh my self constantly and also check my pulse to see if my heart rhythm is normal about 10x a day. My blood pressure is so good that even as I am fucking high out of my mind on meth and just smoked a cig the highest it goes is like 13085 which insanely and funnily enough is still probably lower than like 70 of Americas blood pressure lmao which is just slightly hypertensive. It's normally with only the Cigs and no meth like 9060 sometimes even like 8557 no lie. I attribute it to my whole foodplant based diet. I'm not really sure why I still compulsively take my BP. But anyway This anxiety is destroying me. I really do think I need to be on an SSRI or something but I guarantee I could not even take a single benadryl without panicking hardcore.So. Does anyone deal with this fear of an abnormal heart rhythm specifically? I just wonder how common it is. And how people deal with it. end Xanax fueled rant about my mental issues. I would be shocked if anyone actually reads this entire essay,Anxiety
34242,Swallowing air mostly when laying on my back Since the start of this year Ive had really weird symptoms. It started when i suddenly noticed some faint clicking noises at the back of my throat. I got very scared because i was high on weed at that time and since weed does trigger paranoia I was sent into a fullblown panic attack. While being in a panic attack I first started swallowing a lot of air due to an anxiety reflex. After sobering up I was back to normal. But stupid me thought it was okay to smoke weed again so I had my next panic attack shaking and just feeling and hearing all the air move in my stomach and abdomen. At this point i quit smoking. Yet after that incident i noticed that whenever I laid down on my back and swallowedmostly the normal spitswallow reflex i could hear and feel tiny air bubbles travel down my esophagus. this happens absolutely subconsciously I cannot control it. Ive also noticed how sometimes my ears and my throat hurts. Now Ive become extremely aware of how i breathe how I swallow and when I feel or hear something weird in my body and this led to searching the internet for various reasons as to why this may be happening to me. Ive thought about hiatus herniathe conditions where the diaphragm pushes into the stomach or the esophagus GERDbut Ive never noticed any acidic reflux and so on... Its gotten so bad that some nights I cant even sleep because Im having such bad anxiety about my symptoms... Ive gone to three different doctors the first one completely ignored my symptoms and just said the bloating comes from an intestinal infectionor something like that idk the second one sent me to a therapist to whom Ill go to in march and the third one didnt find anything wtong with me just like the first one. Its extremely hard for me to live with this condition because wherever I searched Ive found absolutely nothing that actually led me to an illness or such. Im using simeticon to relieve the bloating because Im not able to burp all of the air out. But I may add that I do burp a lot because of the subconcious air swallowing which sometimes happens eventhough Im not laying down. When I lay down on my back though it happens almost constant. I was wondering if anyone here has or had something similar to this? ,Anxiety
34243,Left Ear Tingling Side of face numb??

Is this just another weird side effect that can happen that nobody told me about before??? It's kinda freaking me out lol ,Anxiety

Ive had all sorts of cancers such as testicular cancer leukemia skin cancer bone cancer and now its brain cancer. Im seeing my doctor on tuesday and I know he'll just check me and say theres nothing wrong but I still need to know... Not knowing is probably the worst part for me. Im seeing a therapist but it doesnt seem to be very helpful... also I dont wanna take antidepressants. I cant keep living like this... something has to change. Please help me,Anxiety
34245,Terrified of a brain CT scan I had Sorry guys long post but I just need to get this off my chest and I feel like I'm going crazy...Firstly I'm a 23 y.o. male in relatively good health training and playing sports 4ish times a week.So recently I was having a weird pain on the right side of my brain and ongoing pressure that didn't go away for about 4 days. Eventually I went to the doctor who said we should do a 'scan' for reassurance to check if it was serious.I stupidly just went along with radiology and did a brain CT scan when I could have asked for an MRI. Now days later I'm absolutely terrified of the affects of that CT radiation on my brainbody and so much regret I didn't speak up and demand an MRI instead. I've been emailing the clinic and they said that on average a brain CT with the machine Siemens 64 slice Perspective they use gives 1 mSv for a brain CT I'm worried that this is just for a brain scan and that the person doing it would have hit my head among other body parts so the dosage might have been higher. I've now been reading about ionizing radiation for the past few days nonstop with occasional glimpses of hope about how overall the radiation impacted me is nominal compared to the background we receive. But then there are so many questions that stress me out is receiving a large dose in one go the same as a 23 a year of exposure to the body? How much radiation can our bodies deal with? Is there now mutated DNA in my body that could cause problems in the future? Am I more sensitive to radiation than a normal person?I can't sleep properly and I spend my days distracted reading about the odds of contracting a fatal cancer because of a stupid CT scan I could have said no to. I just want some proof to say look the radiation you received is minor and there is almost no risk with the CT. I've read every resource there is I think and done every calculator I could and it still stresses me out. This fear of cancer is partially because I lost my mother when I was quite young to lung cancer and I'm just terrified hereditary impact this has on metldr Had a brain CT worried about brain tumourscancer and now worried the scan could have done more harm then good.,Anxiety
34246,What is wrong with me? Ive always been extremely articulate and smart. I operated on a higher consciousness than most people just in the sense that I was more aware of my surroundings and I thought deeply about things. I was also quick witted and being funny was probably my defining personality trait. Until about a week ago I felt like my normal self still a very anxious person regarding my health particularly a brain tumor. Now I just feel like theres been a substantial cognitive decline. I cant think as deeply and Im constantly second guessing myself on if Im using words correctly. I feel Ike my vocabulary is getting worse and I google synonyms for words about 30 times a day. At the same time I also feel more relaxed. It sounds weird but Id rather feel smart and anxious than dumb and relaxed. Im not even particularly happy. I feel like I have no emotions something that has been persisting for a while but now I feel like I have no intelligence something new to me. I am slower to respond in arguments and dont feel as witty as I was two weeks ago. Maybe Im thinking too much about my speech but I just wish I could revert back to normal. Everything just feels so superficial to me. Its weird. I know a symptom of brain tumors is a shift in consciousness. Im messing up when I talk a lot more. I feel like Im forgetting words and not winning in arguments very rare for me. Im only 15 almost 16 and feel like I have Alzheimers or something. On a side site the only other truly concerning symptom I have that could be indicative of something more serious is the smell of smoke occasionally. This isnt a daily occurrence or even a weekly but maybe once or twice a month Ill get a whiff of the faint smell of smoke that is certainly not coming from real life. As of lately I just feel so dumb. I just cant stress the fact that Ive never felt this way before. I hate this feeling. I havent really had emotions for a while this is due to some trauma Ive been through but lack of intelligence is brand new. I may not be completely devoid of my intellect as Im able to express my thoughts coherently in this format but I feel slower than usual. I use to partake in writing creative stories and stuff and I tried to do that yesterday and I struggled and was uncharacteristically out of ideas. Sorry if this sounds repetitive but this has been going on for about a week now and Im not sure whats up. My parents wont let me get an CAT Scan I got an MRI in March 2016 and everything was fine. Is there a possibly a tumor couldve developed in this short of amount of time? Thoughts and opinions please. I just feel like a completely different personAlso sometimes when Id feel really weird or things would get too heavy Id cry and the feelings would subside. Now I cant even cry cause I feel like I dont even have feelings in the first place. I use to be able to explain this perfectly all the time or so it felt like and I took great pride in my ability to articulate things. Now I feel like whenever I do so theres a little voice in my head questioning what I say and if it makes complete sense. I now I sound articulate in my post but I dont feel like I sound like this in real life. Or it at least takes too long for me to express myself. ,Anxiety
34247,Tested a VR headset for phone Bobo Z4 amp before I could adjust settings to get rid of incorrect settings the screen was double I felt my left eye sting and after that weird sensations in my eye areas and in my headbrain... kinda electrical and spasmlike worried Health anxiety sucks it sucks more when its symptoms overlap with the symptoms of physical conditions.But the symptoms described in the title above were a little... odd. Epilepsyconcerns emerge perhaps mild but still leaving me concerned. Could it just be something that had to do with my eyes needing to adjust or the settings not being correct and thus messing me up for a bit or should I be worried about epilepsyphotosensitivity? I figured I'd ask around to see if it is a sound concern... no access to a doctor right now unfortunately gotta wait til tomorrow.,Anxiety

34250,Muscle twitchingSpasms since Christmas I got sick for a week pretty bad in November and then around Christmas time pretty sure it was the flu. Ever since then I get random twitching and spasms in my muscle all over my body not at the same time. Some days I have it some days I dont.

34251,Fear of exercise and movingexerting myself Hi. I have had many issues with fatigue in the past and they were really terrifying. I've come to develop some kind of PTSD with exercise and exertions.. A few weeks ago I just went to grab some groceries and the exertion from carrying the weight had me suffering in the evening with widespread body pains and an intense fatigue that signalled there was something wrong with my body. In any case I came down with a cough after that so my doctor said I could be coming down with a cold or something and if exertions make me tired I shouldn't exercise and I should rest. It's been 2 weeks I still don't know when it's safe to start moving because I'm still coughing slightly and seem to be coming down with sore throat. I'm terrified of exercising because of my past. Yet I'm so sedentary these days that I'm not comfortable with it either. It's mad unhealthy to not move much. I'm anguished. ,Anxiety
34252,Spinning Downhill All Over Again PLEASE HELP! I haven't been to this sub in over a year.

I've let myself have bad thoughts then fueled them with the dreaded Google...PLEASE HELP.I saw where it could be just benign twitching...COULD BE. Last year I went to the gym and may have lifted wrong so the next day I had arm twitching almost all day. But for this case I haven't been to the gym since Monday! Now Wednesday. Can't be that...right?Stress can cause an overload of muscle stuff...even if I sleep? I'm dissecting everything right now. Yes it's been a hard month with you health fears and questions and stress but I'm now like thinking to myself I'm not really that stressed can that truly be the cause?Google sucks it's the worst type of fear enabler yet so accessible. I'm finding so much Lou Gherigs disease??? Ahh!!! I can see the twitch so that's promising but I'm finding it hard to no look up other symptoms...is it possible???Heart issues! I've always been focused on cancer and stuff along those lines but now I'm freak g about heart stuff. My fit bit typically sometimes shows a range of 58119bpm depending on exercise and relaxation etc. I didn't sleep with it last night but as soon as I saw the heart stuff on Google that heart arythmia and skipping beats I ran to put it on. It ran 54 bpm... then at 66 down to 61 bpm granted back In bed in my safe zone but what if my heart is beating too low??? It's slowly shutting off and gave me the leg twitch as a signal?!?! I'm terrified again upset I'm stressing out about this and worried I might not get out of bed today.Please help I could use any words or advice. So scared...,Anxiety
34253,Scared to death of some wierd symptoms. Greetings. I have extreme health anxeity. For some time i have had troubles with floaters that looked like spiderweb. Recently these past weeks i have also noticed stars in my eyes. They seem to appear randomly and they also move with my eyes similar to floaters. They appear for some seconds then they disapear. I wen't to the eye doctor and he told me that i had PVD or occular migraine. He also told me that my right pupil was smaller then the left one so he called some neurologist and he did some tests but there was nothing wrong with them. But right now im starting to belive that he was wrong and that i have some super rare eye disease or maybe a brain tumor. Should i go back to the doctor or should i take his word that it is nothing serious?,Anxiety
34254,Keflex side effects worried about allergic reaction So yesterday I was prescribed Keflex Cipro for a UTI. Felt ok the first couple doses but I noticed on the 3rd dose I felt kind of light headed and fuzzy. Took my 4th dose around 10 and about an hour ago got up from the couch and was really dizzy. It seems like its a bit better now Im not dizzy while sitting anymore. But I googled and started freaking out some sites say dizziness is a common side effect and some say severe dizziness can be a sign of an allergic reaction. So I started freaking out even more and now I feel like my throat is closing up. I can drink water though and breathe so Im hoping that part is just my anxiety making everything worse. Im going to call the doctors office in the morning to see if I can have a different antibiotic but of course its the middle of the night. Any advice or reassurance would be appreciated....,Anxiety

34256,Back pain on and off? Hi people! I'm worried about a pain in my middle back that comes and goes almost every week. It's a weird pain specifically located in the left side of my back. It isn't an horrible pain but it's really annoying sometimes. Sometimes when I lay down the pain gets better but it's noticeable when i'm sitting or standing I don't know if it's something related to my posture spine nerves... But I'm really worried that could be something related to my stomach like an ulcer or my pancreas... I don't have any other symptoms but my anxious mind thinks the worst. Like I said the pain comes and goes and it usually starts at night in the morning the pain doesn't exists at all. Anyone has something to say? I'm not asking for medical advice just some kind words.,Anxiety

34259,Blood Tests Hey yallFirst time poster so be kind I have had health anxiety for a long time. Im currently a 24 year old female with lots of manageable chronic issues. This requires a lot of blood tests.Every time I have to get one I get really freaked out to the point of causing fights with loved ones and raising my blood pressure with constant anxiety attacks. Im afraid I may pass or during blood tests and passing out is one of my biggest fears. Hearing about how its really not harmful and Ill be fine once I wake up is unhelpful. Its a trigger for me.And heres the thing I have never passed out only gotten slightly woozy. Every time its better than I imagine it being. Can someone give me some advice on how to prevent the slow spiral? ,Anxiety

Hi Im already anxious about some things but now Im really anxious because I got a few hickeys last night and one of them is really long and runs for about 23 inches down my neck.

34261,Aneurysm Fear? I was minding my own buisness last night and heading to bed when a sudden pain took over the left side of my forehead. Lasted all of about 10 seconds and was abrupt but it did make me go Ow! internally. The throbbing continued for around 20 or so seconds afterward. The event however left me feeling mentally discombobulated. I felt so spacy and out of it when moments earlier I had clarity. Derealization galore feeling like I wasn't myself or in my own body. I was also very sleepy so I fell asleep moments later. Today I have pain but only behind my left eye. Sure enough Doc Google says that this is an aneurysm and impending death is imminent. I can't tell if I have a dilated eye just by looking at it but one pupil is larger than the other although this isn't much of the case when I take a pic with flash on it. The pain behind my left eye is more of a nusance than anything extreme.I'd think that one'd know when something this serious was about to erupt no? That's the scary thing about things like this. Anyway health anxiety in general has been ruining my life lately.,Anxiety

34264,The news is giving me anxiety can anyone relate? popular journalist dies of a heart attack after some random stomach pain TRIGGER WARNING. Stop reading if you get easily triggered.So this poor journalist lady who's very popular in my country died of a heart attack few days ago and the news went crazy. Of course it triggered me anxiety as always when I hear of someone else dying. She was 50 and from what I heard she was a healthy and active woman this makes me even more anxious knowing that no matter how healthy you try to be you still can get a heart attack . Apparently she was having a heavy stomach ache and went to doc. She stayed hospitalised and suffered a heart attack during endoscopy procedure. They say that maybe there was smth wrong with the anaesthesia Weird bc it's one of the best private clinics there. So is stomach ache a symptom of heart attack or she died because of anesthesia negligence?. It's worth mentioning that her father's a doctor and she knew a lot about medicine and she didn't seem concerned during her stay,Anxiety
34265,Is it just me or does merely learning about the body trigger some anxiety? I've just started taking a general biology class at uni. My professor is a microbiologist so he knows a lot about infectious diseases and virus. He's somewhat informal so he often goes on tangents about various diseases he's familiar with. It always scares the crap out of me! Even learning about the physiology of the human body triggers my anxiety. My thoughts do that sounds extremely important and also delicate.

34266,Terrified about continuing to go to a chiropractor I've had neck pain and stiffness for months and after an MRI and EMG found nothing like herniated discs or tumors I tried PT and only got worse with periodic lightheadness and nausea.I'm so desperate for relief that I started going to a chiropractor which I've always been skeptical of as a profession. The chiropractor said xrays show my spine is very rigid and doesn't bend like it should when I look straight up so he thinks my cervical joints are the problem. My neck feels worse two days later after he used a chiropractic activator on my cervical spine no twisting or cracking it's a kinetic energy thing that looks like a glue gun. I'm terrified of getting a dissection of the arteries in my neck and having a stroke. But the medical literature shows that cervical dissections are rare and my family and friends who have had benefits from chiros are encouraging me to see through a few more sessions.,Anxiety

Anyways I am pretty sure I have the flu because my symptoms started yesterday typical sore throat etc and 36 hours later my temperature started rising. DONT READ THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU ARE EASILY TRIGGEREDAll I can think about is that Im dying from the flu and that my immune system will attack my organs and that I will die within a couple days all of a sudden like all these people from the news articles.SAFE TO READ AGAINSo people of Reddit who had the flu this season and have recovered can you just please tell me that you feel better and that you survived?

34269,I 28F Health anxiety Help. How did you get over it? Health anxiety SUCKS. Like really sucks. I literally have no reason in my current life to be so down sometimes but I am and I hate it. I'm literally crying. My grandmother two of her sons and one of my female cousins have diabetes. My mom does not and neither does my 14 year old sister. I'm 28 eat relatively healthy but was pretty sedentary up until 3 weeks ago. I weigh 151.7 and I've started exercising 6 days per week 1 hour Zumba super high intensity with plyometrics incorporated and have felt pretty great. I have remained at around the same weight despite all of this. I went out last Thursday about a week ago and got drunk which I never really do. I rarely drink but I felt so terrible and I'm not doing that again. I was super dehydrated and felt like crap all weekend but I still went to Zumba that Saturday. Out of nowhere I start thinking about diabetes and now I'm freaked the heck out. I went through all of my medical records from the past couple of years to try to calm me down fasting glucose at 96 at 78 at 87 most recent in December 2017 was 96. On 552016 my a1c with eAG estimation was 5.0 and my a1c today was 4.9. I did eat a small tub of mangoes from HEB and a green juice prior to my glucose test and that came back at 148. This was literally 1015 mins after eating. I've had some random shooting pain all over my body for a while now and for the past couple of days Sunday I have cold feet I cannot warm up at all. Granted my whole legs hurt and they feel cold from my butt down. My muscles are pretty sore as I've been doing squats and jumping all over the place for an hour daily. I took a rest day today. I seem to find charts and charts about normal diabetic ranges but not normal non diabetic ranges for immediately post meal and that 148 is freaking me out despite of the a1c level.Should I be worried? Also I started new birth control Vienva generic for Aviane and I think this may be causing the cold feet? and maybe the anxiety to go to extremes? I asked the Dr. on Nurx about the birth control and she said it's not a normal side effect of the medication although it is my experience that sometimes they aren't aware of all. My health anxiety started about two years ago with a diagnosis of H. Pylori which has been resolved naturally as the Flagyl and antibiotics caused the first ever anxiety bout I've ever had and continues today. I also had my gallbladder removed and then went to a gastro who said I didn't even need it taken out despite pain attacks. I've had EKG's Echo CT of the pelvis and abdomen with contrast ad I was also getting palpitations. Determined those are PVC's but I did not want to take beta blockers if nothing is structurally wrong with my heart. I just want to be the old me. Three year ago me who gave no fucks about anything until that shit. TLDR Is it diabetes or just health anxiety? Help! I want to be the old me ,Anxiety

34278,I feel like im becoming stupid Hi I've suffered from health anxiety for a few years now but it's starting to drive me crazy. I started getting terrible headaches a few months ago it eventually got so bad that I had to go to the hospital and get a CT scan. They said there was nothing wrong with me. I continued to get headaches and I constantly felt like I was going crazy. I went to a chiropractor and was told that all of my pain is coming from my neck and my back and for some reason I still feel like there is something wrong with my brain. I just recently started having trouble reading the best way to describe it is that it's like I'm stuttering when I'm reading I'm constantly reading stuff and not being able to understand what I just read and then reading it again and realizing that I missed a few words or completely replaced a word with another word. I'm trying to avoid reading because its causing be to become extremely paranoid. I feel like I'm becoming less intelligent or becoming brain dead or something. I'm slowly starting to go crazy and I don't know what to do. I'm probably going to get an MRI just to prove to myself that there is nothing going on with my brain.

34280,freaking out about dvt!!! Hi all. i literally just found this reddit 20 minutes and im already. extremely thankful for it I've suffered with bouts of health anxiety on and off for years and its been one of the most soul crushing things to experience in my life. Lately since I got a big job my anxiety has latched back to my health again because it constantly needs to focus on something with me. I'm a massive worrier in general its terrible but Im trying my best all the time. a few months ago it hyper fixated on blood clots on my legs and DVT thus causing like intense leg pains and what not i think after months of just fixating on it and also developing a real actual flu that was debilitating and not from my hell brain I just wore it out of my brain which is cool i guess. except not really because I've recently developed a lump in my neck most likely frm flu. its painless goes from feeling tender to firm but it swims around a little on my neck and goes from unnoticeable to like really noticeable. what has me freaking out though is that its on top of an artery we went to the er after i had one really bad freak out and managed to at least get a nurse to check it we would have stuck around for the doctor but it was like 1am and we would have had to wait til like 5 am. also my mom kind of started giving me flack on all of this bc she's extremely impatient on my hypochondria and really horrible about it who took my blood pressure and kinda felt it she assumes its a lymph node and i know a nurse isnt a doctor but im trying my best to be rational in that ok maybe she is right because nurses do experience a lot of shit with patients and should be pretty well versed on things. but idk its been like 2 weeks and its still there and my brain is just. in literal hell . im just freaking out that every day is my last and i just have clot hanging out there even though its like painless and not red or like super hot to touch and in like like the next 20 minutes i mgonna just endure a stroke or something and my brain is fried enough as is so im not even processing thoughts properly or anything. also w hypochondria since im like still googling shit on what it may be!!! im starting to endure what im assuming is sensations im making up like pains in my neck whatever. but im also like paranoid that im actually right on all of this because this is the most real physical thing ive experienced i guess with my hypochondria. also ive seen some stuff with swollen things in necks with cancer and at this point im just trying to not even look into that because i think i'll literally have another break down im sorry i guess i just needed to vent somewhere where others would get what im experiencing because at home its been very much condescending and dismissive and i feel extremely trapped and upset. I'd love to go back to the doctors again myself but I have really bad agoraphobia as well and due to how condescending my folks have been with me i feel extremely embarrassedashamedupset on any of my emotions on all of this and how much im fixating. its just really scary and im just really sad at this point. anyway thank you for reading this if you do and being patient with me if you respond,Anxiety
34281,HELP! Testicles question... Recently I noticed one of my testicles is hanging higher than my other. They used to hang at the same height. It doesnt hurt but Im soooooo paranoid about whats going on. I think I might have testicular torsion I dont know how maybe my skinny jeans? but I read online that it would hurt like a motherfucker if I did. Im paranoid and I need help! Im going to try and schedule an appointment for next week with a urologist but Im literally bedridden with anxiety right now. Trying to move as little as possible.Any ideas? Should I be worried?,Anxiety
34282,Return of anxiety after periods of well beinghealthy lifestyle. I'm starting to see a pattern in which different HA develops for me and how it always seems to happen after a short period of little to no anxietytypically after resolution of previous anxiety OR after you start making healthy choices. When I start running or working out I feel at my best but that also comes with me being hyperaware of my surroundings. I'm beginning to think that it is this self consciousness and overly attachment that I have developed and reinforced over the years which has led to this becoming a persistent problem. I have a consistent HA of rabies and hence I'm super aware of all the potential causes that could transmit the virus to me. As you all know by now that this attitude is more destructive than defensive. It has gone to the point that I've started reading scientific literature in hopes of finding the best treatment for my anxiety rather than the health issues. Has anybody noticed similar spikes in their anxiety? ,Anxiety
34283,Aches and Pains after a flu Hey all. So I was suffering from a gastro flu for the last 5 weeks. Reduced appetite nausea chills aches and pains diarrhea etc. all the good stuff. Felt like it took forever to get over. I even had a bad relapse last weekend.... Anyway i seem to be coming out the other end and am starting to feel better. However I am still getting aches and pains in my muscles. Seems to be pretty inconsistent sometimes it's my back muscles around my shoulder blades sometimes it's my shoulders arms and forearms. I've had it in my legs too but that seems to have died down.Anyone else have aches and pains last for a long time after the flu? If so how long we talking? a couple of weeks after? or a month?Thanks for reading!,Anxiety

Then it's back again for a couple months.I suppose it doesn't help that MS effects a large portion of my family and I've had some very convincing symptoms.Has anyone here been worried that they had something just to find out that they did indeed have it?,Anxiety
34285,Obsesssion with Hepatitis C from manicures I'm a woman in her late 20s. Now that I am talking with my husband about having a baby I'm starting to worry that I could have hep c and could pass it to my baby. You might think Easy just get tested but that would stress me out more than anything. There are so many false positives not to mention the fact that if the healthcare law changes I could have a preexisting condition on my record.My therapist doesn't think I should worry. I am not a baby boomer IV drug user never had any blood transfusions my only unprotected sex partner is my husband etc...none of the major risk factors. But I can't stop thinking about the few manicures I've gotten in my life. I've only ever gotten about ten manicures at a salon but I've read that this is a possible mode of transmission. Of course the logic side of my brain tells me that most women get FAR more than 10 manis in their life and most women do not have hep c...but I can't stop thinking about it especially because I've bled on a few occasions during manis I've had probably about 20 pedicures in my life but they were at a high end salon that showed off how well they sterilized everythingAlso I got a tooth pulled in 1997...I assume that's late enough in history for them to be sanitizing everything but who knows?About 4 years ago I had a CMP blood test done and my liver enzymes showed up normal. I assume that if I had had hep C for that long something would have been amiss. But I still can't stop worrying.my therapist thinks I'm clinging to this because I'm secretly more worried about being a mother or the changes a baby will bring but I've hyperfocused on this to distract me from the real concerns....Anyway is he right? am I unnecessarily obsessing over this? How often do you hear about young women with no risk factors coming down with hep C?,Anxiety

34288,Obsessive googling of symptoms hiI'm pretty new to posting but I've struggled with health anxiety for about 18 months now. Thought I got on top of it but I think I was spending my time worrying about other stuff...anyway.My first obsession was a brain tumour but now it's liver cancer because on saturday I went out and got drunk and now I'm obsessed I've lost all alcohol tolerance which could be a symptom. As soon as I read that on some shitty health forum my left side started hurting and I'm convinced I'm yellow now.How do I stop the constant cycle of needing reassuranceworrying about symptoms appearing before they have?Desperately trying to rationalise I drank about 8 measures of gin usually that wouldn't affect me as much as it did and I'd eaten...so clearly I'm stressing tf out.,Anxiety
34289,My health anxiety caused me to get a CT scan and now my anxiety is in overdrive over radiation risks I am a hypochondriac but this time I have been having some severe abdominal pain for 2 weeks. It's constant not one second of peace sleeping is very difficult. I've visited doctors blood tests are normal. I even managed to do an endoscopy which has always been one of my worst nightmares. It showed just a mild gastritis nothing to explain my severe constant pain. I've been taking treatment but there is absolutely no difference. Doctor ordered a CT scan and I was hesitant but after some sleepless nights I decided to go for it. Well the result came right now and there isn't much wrong just a fatty liver and some benign stuff with my prostate. Now I am sad I've irradiated myself for nothing although I don't really regret it never had such pain in my life. The risk is like a 02 increase in cancer but some believe the risk might be a little overestimated for CT scans. I will never accept another CT scan in my life unless it's an emergency. All doctors said abdominal CT scans are better than MRIs so that's why I didn't get an MRI.How do I get past this? I still have the pain and no diagnosis and I increased my risk of cancer. One way of dealing with the risk is to think of it like a screening at least I know there isn't anything sinister going around in my belly.,Anxiety
34290,Im scared of car rides Kinda sound weird but ive gotten into too many car crashes in the past 3 months not because of me i was the passenger. I cant just get into a car for a ride without worrying that someone is gonna hit me. When im on freeways i get too scared because cars arent braking at the right time i want them to cars are too close were going too fast.I hate how scared i get is there anything i can do about it? Is anyone else like this? How do they deal with it ? Probably sounds a bit crazy idk but i hate it i worry too much when im in a car,Anxiety
34291,I'm 16 and going through hell. My anxiety exists due to my high heart rate and I have some questions. I've been dealing with this crap for almost 3 years. It all started with a bad infection that almost costed me a finger. Since then I've thought I had cancer autoimmune diseases genetic disorders neurological disorders diabetes severe mental issues beyond anxiety and a whole bunch of crap. Luckily I saw how ridiculous this was before it got too severe hehe it probably is but not as much as it could possibly get. Now my problem is my heart. I know it is supposed to speed up when having stress anxiety or panic I know why my fingers tingle I know why I hyperventilate and how it makes things worse I know why I get headaches I know! My issue is that it speeds up in a way that I think is too fast. For example during anxious moments my heart rate is around 100120 normal and I understand. During panic attacks my heart rate is about 180205 not normal. My question is if anyone relates to this? The funny not really funny thing about anxiety is that the symptoms cycle. Anxiety is a smart cookie who knows how to fool you pretty bad. I've been writing down EVERYTHING since this started and I've learned a lot about how it works. I've solved my past diseases by finding the flaw in my thinking process but this time I can't. I can count my heart rate when it is that fast. I believe heart anxiety is one of the most difficult ones to beat because the heart does some weird things that we're not supposed to feel but anxiety allows you to. I get ectopic beats My heart stops for a few seconds and then beats strongly again which I know are normal but I feel them and people are not supposed to feel them. It's all due to my anxiety. Anyway I'll repeat my question again Does anyone else gets heart rate of 180 to 205 BPM during panic attacks? ,Anxiety
34292,15 year old Sophomore suffering from Health Anxiety ever since I was in elementary school. It's been inherently worse ever since I tried marijuana last summer. Haven't tried no other drugs since but still. It was a bad trip i had wayy too much.Current fears that have come and goneHeart AttackHeart arrhythmiaCancer BrainALS or some motorneuron diseaseMy current goals are to gain more muscle and be overall more athletic. I want to get rid of my fat and gain muscle. And consequently after sitting in front of a screen for pretty much all of my life i have gained little to no muscle and am extremely weak. So for the past year i started with going for runs around my block and lifting small weights. Then when I got better I jogged for longer periods of time and got a bench press and heavier weights. So I have been lifting weights 6x a week and doing some cardio here and there. I hope i'm not overtraining. but now that my resting heart rate has dramatically decreased went from 7080bpm to now about 4050bpm while resting Scary shit. i don't want it to lower anymore... I'm scared it will just stop while i'm asleep cause it will go too slow and i will die. Irrational? Probably. Impossible? No. That's why all of us worry about this! All the diseases we can get and death... don't get me started on that. Doesn't help I'm an athiest and have severe DPDR.God The story of a boy who lived a sedentary lifestyle up until he was in Grade 9 and then overexercised and killed himself in the process. WTF. I don't want that to be my life story FFS. Just scared. The hospital nearest to me has a bad reputation and houses many drug addicts and is overall filled with sketchy patients so i wouldn't exactly feel safe there. But I'm hanging in there. It's late where i am school tomorrow. Took 0.5mg Lorazepam about an hour ago. I hope i'll live to see tomorrow ,Anxiety

34294,Do I have an aneurysm? Why do I keep thingking my jugular vein is hemorrhaging? I am a 21 year old male. While I often get random stinging senations all over my body and have gotten panic attacks for several diffirent reasons my first panic attack and main source of worry it would seem is my neck. My first panic attack was in the gym a few years ago when I was pushing myself which raised my heart rate I felt a throbbing in my right jugular and convinced myself that I had burst it aninhad somebody call the ambulance while hoping the blood transfusions would arrive in time. I hyperventilated on purpose to make up for the blood loss which made the experience worse and left me scrutinizing my beating and and feeling a drowning sensation for half a year.Sometime later I got some sort of cramp near my left jugular which freaked my out so I went to the doctor and they said my jugular was fine. Then less then a week ago I sneezed strongly which made my left jugular pulsate strongly which freaked me out because... Well why only one side? Today I was at the supermarket coughed strongly and felt pain in the left jugular when I did that. Within a few minutes I was about to pass out my hands were cold and my whole body was buzzing which of course confirmed to me that I was in fact losing blood. I did mange to snap out of it but why won't this just go away?,Anxiety

So one day I dont know how much later it was I saw my foot and it was now bigger and now brown. I touched it and it peeled off. It left a little hole with normal skin underneath and healed up fine. This petrified me. It hasnt happen again. I told some adults and they reassured me all was okay. Well Im still horrified about it and I have been subtly for those three years. I really have never had anxiety this bad. Im so so scared I dont know what to do.

34297,Throat IssuesFears This is my first time posting on this subreddit... I've had some nasty health anxiety that's been going on since I had brief exposure to asbestos tile about a month ago during some home renovation. Ever since then I've been convinced that I've acquired cancer of the mouththroat. I recently went to the dentist to check out some mouth sores and bumps and they were found to be nothing. For the last week and a half I've had some issues with what feels like swallowing on my right side of my throat. No real pain but also no lumps or bumps in my throat or neck to speak of. Recently though I chose to feel in the back of my throats and felt what feels like cartilagebone on the right side of my throat. It is a hard ridge and doesn't appear on my left side. I don't have any pain and haven't had any other symptoms to speak of. I'm wondering If anyone would have any idea what this is or maybe it's just normal and I'm overly paranoid due to my recent health anxiety. My fianc is a PA student and hasn't been overly concerned at all and at my physical a month ago a blood test showed normal white blood cell count. I still can't stop thinking it's cancer though and really looking for advicehelp on this. I've been through a lot of stress lately and just looking for some support. Any thoughts help or support would be much appreciated. ,Anxiety
34298,Random Small Scratch On My Hand ... Rabies? HiI was out walking today around 1200 noon and when I passed a tree I heard a flapping of wings but I didn't see if it was a bird.For some reason I felt the need to check my hand due to the slightest feeling I may or may not have made up in my head and I regret ever deciding to so. I found a small scratch with two little holelike cuts about a centimeter apart with little scab linings connecting the holes. I'm deathly afraid that I got bitten by a bat and didn't really feel it.

34299,Distrust of doctors and diagnoses how to overcome? I've had quite severe health anxiety for a few years. It's hopped from one malady to another and medical counseltests do not assuage it as I'm always convinced they've missed something.Most recently it's cancer at first lymphoma now cancer in general. I've visited specialists GPs had chest xrays and bloodwork and finally a full CT scan with contrast. Despite the all clear in each instance I spend a debilitating amount of energy on the anxiety they've missed something. Each diagnostic procedure seems to buy me a few weeks of calm before the terror and doubt returns.I do not have systemic symptoms of cancer and am in apparent good health save mild diagnosed GERD but compulsive google'ing assures me many healthy people in their early 30s are diagnosed with terminal cancer out of the blue after numerous misdiagnoses etc. That GERD must be stomach cancer the lymph node that swelled after a dental infection must be lymphoma the doctors are brushing me off the medical system in Korea is inadequate the medical system in Australia is inadequate I've carried this pattern through the doctor's offices of three nations!I recognize the compulsive and anxious biases I'm operating on here but I don't know how to change them. For those who have endured something similar how do you learn to trust the doctors' all clear? How do you trust that you would probably show some obvious symptoms in case of serious illness and those symptoms would be correctly interpreted?I'm feeling exhausted and hopeless from the unending cycle of costly medical tests which produce little effect on my anxiety. Your advice is appreciated.,Anxiety

34301,Absolutely terrified of having autism. Does anyone have fears of mental illness developmental delay? This would honestly be funny if it didnt scare me so badly. I dont really even know why it scares me this much and I feel bad because autism isnt strictly a negative. Its just a different wiring of the brain that emphasizes different skills. Its dumb but I cant help it. Last night I had a nightmare that I was actually autistic and that no one had ever told me so that I could live a more normal life. The whole thing shattered my perspective of myself in a way that was profoundly uncomfortable and was kind of from a third person view although I felt everything very intensely. I looked quite different but the thing that freaks me out is that what if I actually do look like that and just have a very limited outside perspective of myself. I also saw a bunch of ways that maybe certain interactions I thought were normal may only have felt alright because Im actually autistic. This all would just be a weird one off dream if I hadnt been terrified of being autistic for a long period last summer. I would spend every break possible at my summer internship taking diagnostic tests to prove to myself that I dont have it. I was an anxious mess.Since then Ive had a number of fears about having different mental illnesses everything from schizophrenia to NPD to bipolar and dont know quite what to do about it. I think I have ocd but I havent been able to go to therapy. Has anyone else had hypochondria about these specific themes? What strategies help you?Edit I also know that I dont have any of the symptoms but I cant help be afraid any way. ,Anxiety

It's not quite the pain I've felt before but I can't see it as a dumb coincidence.

34304,Overcoming exhaustion? First time poster here. I think its appropriate because I think a big part of this may be health anxiety related.I travel a lot for my job. Its midfeb and Ive been in 5 cities in 2 countries already. I train and speak so its energy intensive work. Not to mention flying all the time. I have two cross country trips 5 flights this week alone.I keep getting super sick. Last year I was not well bronchitis pneumonia from early October through thanksgiving then caught the flu in early December. Yesterday I started coming down with aches and sore throat had to take a day off work to rest and am fully exhausted still.I dont know if this is a real thing or if this is normal given the circumstances? I now have so much anxiety about staying healthy that I take all kinds of supplements and wear a mask in airportsplanes. I was my hands every hour. I feel like such a freak but Im so tired of being sick Ill do anything!I want to get stronger but the exhaustion gets worse after I exercise. Ill swim in a hotel pool or walk a few miles and just be crawling at the end of a really light workout.Any advice from folks who have overcome or learned to manage exhaustion gratefully received.

34305,Ear infection or something more? Hi all this is sort of a follow up post from this httpswww.reddit.comrHealthAnxietycomments7xnd17whentogotothedoctorforrecurringfluI woke up with ear pain this morning in addition to the other symptoms and Ive had recurring ear infections for the past few years so I didnt think it was related to everything else going on. The doctor said that its a middle ear infection and my lungs sounded clear my throat looked fine etc. so the fever and aches are all from the ear. While I was in the waiting room I went and replied to my post above. A few minutes after the receptionist called me up to the desk to get my doctors note for Work and when I got there I faintedlike full on blacked out unconscious woke up confused and surrounded by nurses etc. Ive fainted before but only when needles were involved. The doctor said I had low blood pressure and low blood sugar probably true Ive had no appetite and have barely eaten and the fainting was not because of the ear infection itself. Im home now and my fever is still 100. Im just worried because the ear pain didnt even start until today but Ive had the fever since yesterday. Do you guys think I need a second opinion or am I overanalyzing this?,Anxiety
34306,Does anyone else have a rotating 'portfolio' of health worries? I've had a number of scares in the past year since I've identified my health anxiety. I wouldn't call any of them explicitly painful but there's a distracting discomfort that's hard to shake and when a panic attack happens the discomfort is magnified a hundredfold. My mind tends to focus on one of them at a time my chest my abdominal area my tooth filling and my testicle. Doctors have already told me that each of these areas are fine and I'm mostly mentally stable with that but when my anxiety flares up it tells me that the doctors didn't do enough tests they just brushed it off as imagined anxiety pains or IBS because I'm young and the probability of something serious is low. It's like my anxiety constantly picks at my defenses to see if it can get a footing and crawl into my brain. I used to be a WebMD nut that would look up every odd symptom and have panic attacks. I still get freaked out by the odd thing that I have a brain tumor every time I misspell a word or I flub some speech for example. But I'm mostly sticking to the ones I know nowadays. Does anyone else have a 'portfolio' of halfresolved worries like this? Or does your anxiety mostly conjure up new symptoms? ,Anxiety
34307,Been sick since Sunday worried I have pneumonia Well here we go. On Sunday I started feeling something in my throat and the next morning I woke up feeling like total shit. Muscle aches sore throat all the fun stuff. My entire family has it now. No fever though. Now I feel almost fine but my throat fucking HURTS. Whenever I breath in deep or swallow I can feel it all along my throat into my chest like right under my sternum. I'm not wheezing or anything and I occasionally have a cough that brings up phlegm but there's no blood in it or anything it's kind of a greenish brown color. The cough hurts my throat as well. I'm just worried I'm dying of pneumonia or something. I've heard people say you definitely know when you have it because you get ridiculously sick but I'm still worried I called my doctor and they only have an opening today at 3 which I can't find a ride to get to. The next opening was Tuesday. Could I go to urgent care?If anyone has any advice that be awesome. I just need some piece of mind.,Anxiety
34308,Cross post with AskDocs random swelling?? HelloI'm a 23yearold female nonsmoker otherwise healthy despite an insane amount of anxiety. I've had slightly swollen lymph nodes on my neck for a while but doctors I've seen haven't been concerned because I weigh 116 pounds and have a really thin neck an ENT basically told me to dismiss it unless they actually get bigger. It's only one one side. During my appointment with the ENT though I insisted she check my parotid glands because the left side of my face feels a bit swollen. She agreed but said it could be caused by a ton of things. My cheek is a bit swollen on the inside too. It's most notable right under my ear lobe resting on my jaw. It feels like a lump that's noticeably bigger than the right side of my face.She referred me for an MRI with contrast and suggested I cancel a sonogram I had scheduled because an MRI would be better anyway I did. I haven't had that yet but I'm really freaked out and wondering if there's anything else I should be concerned with or if I should take her advice to just chill. I've had ulcers on that side of the mouth before 12 at a time two years ago apparently caused by stress I wore clear retainers for two years that could have caused swelling and I had impacted wisdom teeth removed 8 months ago. They were more impacted on that side of my mouth. I'm not sure what to do just wondering if I'm going crazy or if I'm right to be concerned. Also I'm more short of breath lately not like short of breath in a way where I'm sweaty and my heart's beating fast. Short of breath like my throat feels tight. But that could be caused by anxiety too. Thanks for you help.,Anxiety

34312,Getting over being sick weird things are happening So I'm getting over being sick. Went to the doctors yesterday and he said my temp was 99.1 and that I probably have a virus of some kind and that he thinks I'm recovering and that I should be feeling better in a few days. Well this morning I woke up DRENCHED in sweat. So much so that my hands were pruned. I thought that was strange but I got up and took a shower and started relaxing in my room. Well like 6 hours later my hands are still slightly pruned. I've been drinking plenty of water but it's still happening and it's freaking me the fuck out. Other than that I feel almost totally fine. I've also been having loose stools. Another thing is that I have absolutely zero appetite. I started getting sick Monday and my appetite has been gone since. I just feel weird like.....slow and foggy. I've been forcing myself to eat food as much as I can but absolutely nothing sounds appealing.I'm having a fucking meltdown right now. I'm freaking out about why my hands are pruned why I woke up so sweaty why I still don't have an appetite and why I feel so weird. Has anyone had anything like this happen? I'm convinced I'm dying of something or have pneumonia even though my doctor said my lungs sounded fine.,Anxiety

34315,Is this Anxiety? Ive never considered myself an anxious person.Starting probably last week Ive had a strange urgefeeling to breath deep as if to catch my breath. Its like the feeling of turning the water on cold in the shower. Once I take that deep breath it goes away for a bit then usually comes back until I do it again. Yawning makes it go away as well. Its weird it feels like I am now consciously thinking about breathing which I have never really done before. Sometimes feels like my throat is tight and sometimes this whole thing even makes me lightheaded.Ive been the the doc had an EKG Chest Xray all checks out ok. Curious if I am experiencing anxiety? Is this a symptom? Any help would be appreciated!! ,Anxiety

34317,Health anxiety makes everyday tasks so difficult Some background about my health anxiety history Ive had severe health anxiety intermittently since my teens. Most often I am preoccupied with my heart. My heart rate has always jumped up quickly 180ish bpm with minimal exercise or even at times of rest but my resting heart rate is usually 4555 bpm. I mention numbers just because my heart rate is a little atypicalbut I have been checked out by cardiologists so many times over the past 15 years always with the reassurance that I am fine. Most recently this past summer I wore a 30 day holter monitor where they would measure my episodes of high heart rate. They also did a stress test numerous ekgs etc. They confirmed I had periods of sinus tachycardia but it was normal rhythm and said I was healthy. They said the heart was appropriately responding and was likely beating fast because of anxiety which I dont think is the whole story I think I have a food allergy which can trigger it but thats beside the point.. They gave me a low dose of beta blockers to take as needed for comfortanxiety but promised I wouldnt have a heart attack with or without the pills. Anyways to bring my story to today Ive been putting off doing laundry for far too long. Im embarrassed to admit I have been buying new clothes to prolong my laundry chore. The issue is in my apartment I have to carry my laundry down a few flights of stairs outside and into another building. After its clean I have to carry it again outside and then up a few flights of stairs. The laundry basket is heavy and my heart races so fast when I do this and I panic. I just did a load and I could feel my heart beating out of my chest. I sat down with a glass of water and within 60 seconds my heart rate was back in the 70s. I remind myself that my stress test was normal even when they brought my heart rate to 190 for several minutes. But I am still so freaked out. I have several more loads to do and Im so afraid.I know part of the answer is that I am incredibly out of shape and weak. This is not coincidence I am extremely avoidant of anything that raises my heart rate and am terrified of exercising. I stopped wearing my Fitbit a few months ago at the urging of my therapist because I obsessively measured my heart rate and was even afraid of standing upwalking I believed if my heart rate went above 80 it would trigger a heart attack. Taking off my Fitbit was one of the scariest things Ive done but now that its been a few months I feel SO much better. I do my best not to measure heart rate now and have been going on more walks but lifting anything makes me feel my heart rate and I cant ignore it. I just feel so stuck and like I cant keep up with basic chores. I feel like a failure of an adult. I dont know what Im asking for this is mostly a rant. Ive been lurking this subreddit for months and its brought me a lot of comfort. Health anxiety is such a difficult illness but this community helps me feel less alone.TLDR my health anxiety is about my heart rateheart attacks. Basic chores like laundry elevate my heart rate and cause panic and avoidance. Feel like I cant keep up with life. ,Anxiety
34318,My silly panic attack last night I'm sharing this panic attack story because I feel it represents health anxiety and might help you all to cope with physical symptoms. This might be a little long.I had had a stressful day at work and had also done an anxiety nono and googled my irregular period symptoms I have been having recently. Needless to say this all made me panicky by the evening. When I got home I vented to my husband smoked some high cbd low thc cannabis and worked out for an hour hoping that would calm me. It worked for the most part until bedtime.I was laying in bed surfing the interwebs before I fell asleep when it happened. A weird physical sensation. Felt like my throat went numb. Now I had experienced this symptom before about a year ago and at that moment I had forgotten about that. A year ago I had a full neurological check up including an MRI. Of course all results were negative and I was fine. In the moment though I couldn't remember that. So I started to get nervous. Is it a stroke or seizure? Is my throat closing in anaphylactic shock? I had to check to be sure. So I shove my my finger into the back of my throat feeling around. I'm pushing in really far and playing with my uvula. I can feel everything. Good okay. Throat's not numb. But wait why am I not gagging? Thats weird. My finger's digging in but I'm not gagging at all. I think you all can guess what I did next right? Yup I googled it. What came up was horrifying. The worst results I have ever seen from Googling symptoms. Then BAM! Heart starts racing my face goes numb and I start to shake uncontrollably. I start calling my husband's name telling him I think he should call 911. Luckily I recognize the shaking and racing heart as a panic attack and not a part of the symptoms mentioned on Google. My husband was a champ! He got me started on deep breathing and began to comfort me. I started to calm the panic attack pretty quickly but what I saw on Google still screamed in my head. I wondered if I could wait to go to urgent care in the morning or if I really should go to the er now. I always worry about the boy who cried wolf kinda symptoms. Like I keep getting weird symptoms and it's always nothing but the one time I should have gone to the er I ignored it instead. I'm sure we've all been there. I explain to my husband what triggered the panic attack and he insists I'm fine. Its at this point I remember I've had the numb throat feeling before and had negative MRI results. But I had never stuck my finger down my throat. Maybe if they had known I couldn't gag they would have done another test or know other symptoms to diagnose me. As my panic attack subsided I got up to use the bathroom. Away from my husband I tried to make myself gag with my finger again. Nothing. Next however I jammed my toothbrush down my throat and GAG! Oh sweet relief! I can gag! Turns out after testing it out I can't gag myself with my own finger. Or at least it's really hard to. I had jumped to conclusions because well how often does a person try to gag themself with their finger? I think a lot of our symptoms are like this. We become so sensitized and aware of our bodies we notice things we never paid attention to before and then freak out fearing the worst or Googling it. These are really just normal body sensations that most people are able to ignore or not even feel.I should have kept the fact I had a rough day in the back of my mind and taken a minute or two after I had noticed the first symptom to see if it went away by distracting myself. And never ever ever Google a symptom! NEVER! I know we know this and I know how hard it is not to but don't and don't body check your symptoms either. Distract or truly objectively analyze your symptoms. More often than not they will go away or not be nearly as strong as they first felt. This was my first panic attack in over a year and I'm not letting it get me down. It has reassured me that while uncomfortable panic attacks aren't dangerous. It also allows me to recognize my symptoms of stress leading up to an attack so next time I can perform more stringent selfcare before it snowballs into an attack. These moments are only making it easier for me to recover from anxiety not making it worse. Stay strong everyone! ,Anxiety
34319,Just have to get this out Female 33 years old BMI 23 April 2017 I got a coughcold. I continued coughing on and off for months mostly in the morning no other symptoms ie no weight loss no fatigue. In October after several months personal upheaval I managed to go to the Doctor who sent me for a chest xray just to rule out an infection. Chest xray comes back with what the radiologist says could be a chest infection so it's recommended that I take antibiotics.I take a week of amoxicillin on the 4th day I start getting a rash on my hands and feet which starts creeping up my limbs on the following days. I call my Dr who recommends that we switch to a different antibiotic sorry don't remember which one it was. I take that for a week. After the course is over I'm still coughing mostly in the morning.I go back to my Dr who sends me for another chest xray which comes back with no indication of infection and then my Dr sends me on to a respiratory medicine specialist.Respiratory medicine Dr orders blood tests chest CT scan and a breathing test. Blood tests have come back with borderline high levels of IgM and I am FREAKING out about what this means. No results from anything else yet. Respiratory medicine Dr thinks I have reflux and has put me on 40mg of an acid reducer. At no point did she say she thinks I have any signs of anything life threatening. I'm just so scared. I've always been a hypochondriac and I am finding it really hard waiting for the results from all these tests. ,Anxiety
34320,this sounds stupid RAS?? FIRST TIME EVER POSTING ON REDDIT. I've been lurking on here knowing I shouldn't. I know reading your guys posts will not help my recovery. I also know posting won't either but tonight I don't care. I really need someone to tell me they know what I'm talking about. Okay so at night I have this weird thing happen to me. I can only describe it as RLS but it's NOT in my legs. It's in my arms and the back of my head?? It's like my arms are tickley. It feels like there's millions of bugs under my skin but they also feel light. Like feathers or jello. So hard to describe. I will wake up with it in the middle of the nightearly morning and just lay there thinking im going to die until I have to go to work..nothing i do stops it and it's been months. I'll have it for a couple weeks then it will go away but a few weeks later its back. I've been thinking I have MS or a brain tumor forever now and more symptoms keep popping up but nobody listens...I've been to the doctor 27 times for many of things in the past 6 months and I keep getting the you're perfectly healthy although I've never got a CT scan or MRI. they've done neurological tests eyes and strengthbalance things and then said theres no need to do scans and put radiation in my body for no reason. I've tried looking this up many of times with no answers. I'm scared of a wrong diagnosis. If they are right then HOW can anxiety cause this? How. it doesn't make sense. I'm terrified and exhausted. Normally I'd be more frantic but I've been laying here for hours already and I'm just getting tired and pissed at this point. How come all my anxiety stems from being scared to die but I don't want to exist anymore?..,Anxiety

Not googling symptoms has also had a massive improvement.I've also noticed that it is when I have a lot of downtime that I get my health anxiety back and it is virtually non existent when I'm super busy as my brain has something to focus on.Hope this helps someone! ,Anxiety
34322,Placebo effect I take vitafusion womens multivitamins and I notice increased energy. However it has things like 300 DV of B12 which sounds like overkill. I eat very healthy and try to eat a balanced diet but I notice that when I stop taking the vitamins for more than two days I start to feel tired. Maybe its other factors that are causing that tired feeling. I know that you pee out excess vitamins but ive read that vitamins arent really necessary if you eat well. I was thinking of only taking it on days that I felt like I wasnt eating a balanced diet and was lacking in certain areas. Any advice?,Anxiety
34323,Advice? Life's become quite hard worrying about heart attacks I'm 19 6'1 and about 75kg. I've drank loads of energy drinks in my life and I'm a bit lethargic I don't do anything deliberately to exercise. But I'm not fat and I don't eat too badly and whatever. No family history of heart attacks at all that I know of just a lot of cancer. But the past 5 months literally every day I worry I'm having a heart attack. Whenever I get a bit of chest pain I sieze up and think Right this is it. And I was never a worrier before this I'm a really confident person don't mind getting up on a stage at all. Yet I spend a lot of my days worried shitless about heart attacks now. I went to hospital a few months ago and had a lot of tests done and they said they'd found nothing wrong with me. I had an ECG I think it's called EKG in America? blood test chest xray ultrasound in my belly obviously the doc checked me out with a stethoscope and they couldn't find anything wrong. Yet the worry didn't go away. Over Christmas it got really bad I got scared just walking down the stairs thinking it'd kill me. I do get chest pain and I do think it's real and probably happens worsemore frequently to me than most people but it's probably just indigestion or something right? I do eat quite a lot of spicy food and I like fizzy drinks. I don't worry much about other things like cancer I don't worry about them as much as I should. I just worry about heart attacks and suddenly dying. I always feel uncomfortable in my torso and I'm not sure if there's something wrong the doctors haven't found or if if's purely anxiety. I'm not prone to heart conditions or to anxiety which came first? Which one is real? I feel a pain in my chest and I get a shooting pain down my left arm fairly often isn't it natural for me to worry about that? I might have a heart condition that's only detectable when I move around and walk and get the heart going a bit more.Dunno why I worry about silly shit I can't control. All I know is I have to walk 20 minutes to class this morning and I know the whole time I'm gunna be having mini panic attacks thinking any second I'm going to die. I'm not going to die right?Tldr I'm not at risk of heart attack but I worry about it a lot because I get a lot of chest pain. Doctors can't find anything wrong with me. I'm not usually an anxious person but I worry about this more than I probably should. How do I cope? What's wrong with me?,Anxiety
34324,My vision is blurry and I think I have MS This is a lot so bear with me. And it's mostly a vent because I'm absolutely fucking terrified.Last Saturday I woke up with weirdly blurred vision in my right eye. I have pretty bad eyesight to begin with but this was different. I thought it was because I was hungover or something but it didn't go away. I made the mistake of googling and holy shit I'm losing my mind. Everything I'm experiencing the blurry vision the color distortion the eye pain is consistent with optic neuritis which is usually the first symptom of MS. I'm so fucking terrified and I can't shake the feeling that I just found my death sentence. I went to the eye doctor and he said he didn't see any damage in my eye but he wants me to go back in tomorrow and see if anything has changed. Which it hasn't. I still can't see worth a damn out of that eye. He said I might have to get an MRI which I'm convinced is going to show that my brain is full of lesions and tumors and all sorts of awful things. Anyway there's not a lot of point to this but I'm a major hypochondriac and I'm not in any way ready to deal with the fact that there could actually be something wrong with me. I can't focus on anything and I've spent all day crying. I'm usually at least able to say well I'm probably jumping to conclusions and it could be this instead but literally everything I read said that I have MS. And even on the MS sub there's tons of posts where people had the same symptom as me as their first sign of the disease. It's a lot to handle and I'm not doing well. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.,Anxiety
34325,Weird body sensation I've been going through a bad batch of anxiety the past month or so.At one point I was so anxious my fight or flight response kicked in for about a week and I've struggled to get rid of all of those symptoms. Which in turn has led me to believe I'm hypomanic which adds to the anxiety.Anyways every once in awhile I'll get this very weird bodily sensation that is very hard to describe. It almost feels like my whole body and head feels numbtingly but also heavy. It always makes me think of clay stress balls this association always pops into my head which makes me even more anxious that I'm 'losing my mind'. Or like silly putty when you 'snap' it vs stretch it. The longest it's lasted is a few minutes. But now it happens for maybe a minute at most because instantly I start fretting about what it is and seem to scare myself out of it. Could this be related to anxiety or something deeper? Anyone experience anything similar? Or does it sound like dpdr or a hallucination or the beginnings of maniapsychosis?,Anxiety
34326,Left thigh paintinglenumbness Since I was 19 29 now I have had tingling and numbness in my upper left thighleg. When I was 19 I went to the Dr he picked up my leg patted it and said looks like a healthy 19 year old leg to me. I am starting to get concerned because the pain has been getting more severe and I am worried it is something major. Anyone else experience this?,Anxiety
34327,Worried sick. So. I have had health anxiety very bad since I was a kid. Around 22 years of dealing with this since my dad died out of the blue from a heart attack when I was almost 8. It ranges from cancer to HIV to ALS and everything in between it seems like. So. On Friday last week. I noticed that I had a lymph node under my jaw on my right side that is swollen. So swollen to the point it's visible to me and other people. Last night I went to the ER because I was freaking out so bad. They told me I had strep throat and the flu and that's what was causing it. But I really have symptoms of neither. Other than a few red streaks on my throat I can see with a flashlight. No sore throat no fever no cough. Should I just trust the doctor? I really just need some calming down here. I trusted him for like 30 mins and then went back to the whole well what if they got it wrong or got my tests mixed up with someone else's thing that I do a lot. I am at my wits end right now. ,Anxiety
34328,Worried Hey so Ive been a hypochondriac for quite some time now. A few days ago I slept with this guy and even though I used a condom and Im on birth control Im worried I may be pregnant. My period still hasnt come yet but it can also be irregular sometimes due to my birth control Im on Nexplanon. I read online that taking high amounts of Vitamin C and taking Dong Qaui and Black Cohosh supplements can help with miscarriage. I started taking 2 capsules of 568 mg of Dong Qaui and 2 capsules of 540 mg of Black Cohosh every 2 hours and 5000 mg of Vitamin C since Monday. I was also pressing down hard on my uterus a few days ago and now my uterus is tender to the touch Im experiencing nausea lightheadedness and racing heart rate. The nausea lightheadedness and racing heart rate could be due to my anxiety but I dont know. I realize that what I did was stupid and I stopped taking the supplements but now Im worried what if I injured myself my pressing down too hard on my stomach? Im thinking of maybe going into urgent care tomorrow and Im also scared to tell my doctor I feel like at times she really judges me for having anxiety. I also feel so ashamed and stupid right now and Im so scared I hurt myself,Anxiety
34329,Health anxiety for other people After a lifetime of obsessing over my own symptoms currently have colon cancer andor ovarian cancer btw Im now completely convinced my husband has head and neck cancer. He has been clearing his throat more than usual and is in a risk group for that particular cancer. Hes 37 and otherwise healthy so hes not dashing off to the doctor but I now have a strong anxiety response every time he clears his throat and Im making myself and him a nervous wreck.

I didnt think it was possible to have any LESS control ,Anxiety
34330,Premature Heart Beats This is one of the hardest things for me to deal with. I have had premature atrial contractions premature junctional contraction and premature ventricular contractions for like 4 years now. At one point I was in bigeminy for 1.5 months. Scariest and most depressing time of my life. I could not leave the house and was in constant discomfort. I went to every doctor and they all claimed they were benign. Cut out this add this don't exercise too much exercise more.This is what gives me Health anxiety. There's nothing I can do about it. All my doctors including my Mayo cardiologist and electrophysiologist says an ablation would more than likely make things worse. So I live with these day in and day out. I've tried everything. The best thing I have is magnesium glycinateWhat do you do when the something you can't fix.? But you still have to go on. I'm not even worried about them killing me but they caused me so much discomfort that it affects my quality of life. I don't see an answer to this.Health anxiety to something that is actually physically happening to you but is considered benign truly sucks. Sorry for the rant,Anxiety

34332,New to this Hey allIm new to Reddit but some recent health concerns have made me feel like I should reach out to some objective people for my situation. Im 24 years old and before a little over a week ago I thought I was in great health. A little over a week ago I started noticing heart palpitations didnt know what it was called for a while and chest pain. I thought this would just go away but it didnt after a couple of days. Then I had my first and second ever anxiety attacks. These were scary but I felt like I was anxious about my palpitations because they lasted all day and night. My pulse was constantly 20 bpm faster than it used to be and the chest ache and pain lasted almost 24 hours. Ive seen doctors and nurses and Ive had a chest Xray blood work and CT done and they didnt find anything abnormal. Ive been tracking my blood pressure as well and its constantly in the 15090 range and today during a snow day Ive been laying in bed and the pain and palpitations are feeling worse than ever and my BP was 160110 and my pulse 105. I had a Holter monitor and Im waiting to hear the results. I also started seeing a counselor. I dont consciously feel anxious and my symptoms last all day and all night. Im waiting for my next doctors appointment but Im just reaching out because I feel worse day after day and just wanted to see if anyone else has been through something similar to this.Thanks,Anxiety
34333,Anyone else scared of the flu and frustrated with the advice to protect yourself by washing your hands? So scared of flu. I'm so tired of these articles on protecting yourself from the flu. What scared me is that sometimes you have to be aorund other people and you can't help it. I got the flu because I was on the subway and a lady coughed in my face it was a crowded car. I couldn't get away. Washing my hands won't do shit. I am so scared to leave the house because the flu is deadly. And people will infect me. ,Anxiety

34336,Massive abdominal pains for the last 2 days... Hi guysI'm in a pretty bad state right now. For the last 2 days I've been having really big and sometimes debilitating pain in my abdomen area. It first started around the side of my abdomen kind of like a stitch then throughout the day it slowly travelled to the middle just above my belly button. Last night the pain travelled down to my lower right which instantly got me worked up thinking of appendicitis.Phoned 111 and they recommended I go to the local AampE. The blood test was fine and the doctor said he doesn't think it's appendicitis. The problem is this pain has been so intense for the last 2 days and it doesn't seem to stop just travel around my abdomen a bit but is very intense in the lower right at the moment.Any idea what this could be?,Anxiety

However I have been getting my life back over the last 2 years.But it has taken effort commitment and the realisation that this is here with me still at least for the time being and without consistent maintenance i'll end up back where I was.Some days it still wins but with each month those days get less and less.My health anxiety no longer and will never again define who I am. ,Anxiety
34338,Scared I have mouth cancer at 19. Background so I've been out at college since August been to a couple of parties and took up smoking why because it looks cool. There I admit it. I would say I've been smoking since around Octber or November. I smoke maybe half a pack every other weekend if that. Maybe have one or two on the side here and there but I wouldn't consider myself a smoker. I've noticed a sore in my mouth it's all white doesn't look harmful. I think it's a canker sore as I've been drinking coffee like hell these past couple of weeks sometimes without regard for how hot it is. Is it possible to get mouth cancer after smoking maybe two or three packs of smokes in total in my life or am I just freaking out over a little blister? Thanks for the help. ,Anxiety
34339,Fear of Brain Damage My health anxiety has completely debilitated me for the past four months due to worry that I damaged my brain from drinking for years. I constantly test my memory and feel it is declining rapidly. I have trouble picturing things from seconds ago in my mind all my memories no matter how distant or recent feel insanely foggy time is flying by as I feel Im not forming new memories and I often cant remember if I did something today or the day before even if it was just a few hours ago. Scarier symptoms involve me feeling confused and unfamiliar with my own family house dog etc. and feeling like I have to remind myself where I am or where Im going. I have brief moments of confusion where I have to piece everything together and constant memories that have nothing to do with what Im doing which lead me to a fear of seizures that I ended up being tested for that have happened for he past few years when I was super anxious. I have had an MRI CT PET 3 day eeg and neuropsych testing and everything came back good but I cant believe my symptoms are just anxiety and derealization since it feels its progressively getting worse over the past few months which I barely have any memories of. I honestly feel I have severe short term memory loss and have posited thy maybe I was having seizures and brain damage from alcohol but the neurologist psychiatrist GP neuropsych and therapists all dont think so.I have in the past believed I had HIV liver failure mouth cancer throat cancer and other ailments and of course they all ended up being false but this one feels so much more real.

34341,Rabies anxiety So I have pretty severe rabies anxiety which usually only acts up in the summer. I'm lucky in that I don't really worry about cats or dogs since I next to never interact with them but I'm absolutely terrified of a rabid bat getting into my room and biting me without my knowing it. We've had bats in our house twice now and maybe two or three years ago finally did an exclusion in our attic and had a professional go around and seal everything up.I haven't slept with my window open at night for several years now but last night I left it open by mistake until around 4 in the morning which naturally set off my anxiety. I have a screen on my window which sort of sets against a little interior strip of wood but it isn't tightly sealed and there's one side that's actually quite loose big enough that a bat probably could get through.I'm trying to be very logical about this but I'm struggling. I was in my room basically all night until I went to bed at around 4 AM and never saw a bat or heard anything against the screen but just knowing that my window was open and what if a bat got in while I wasn't looking or when I left the room or something? Reasonably I know a sick bat wouldn't be able to get back out if one had gotten in and I don't think there's any way I wouldn't notice a bat flying around healthy or otherwise! but it's very hard to convince myself of that.,Anxiety
34342,Freaking out about chipping a tooth I was eating a hamburger today and I felt a crack in the back of my mouth. I made the burger from a premade frozen patty and I didn't season it with anything that could make a cracking noise. Now I'm freaking out worried that I cracked a tooth. I can't feel anything obvious but I am noticing an asymmetry in the shape of one of my rearmost teeth when feeling it with my tongue.,Anxiety
34343,Can't stop worrying For the past few weeks I've been having flashing in my vision. It's usually a very small white light that appears for a split second then goes away once I try to look at it. Well ever since that started happening I've like been sent over the edge and am almost constantly worrying that I have a myriad of neurological diseases from a stroke to retinal detachment to a brain tumor. I've also been having stomach pains like nausea for the past few days but I'm not sure if im making up phantom nausea because I'm worried I have a brain tumor. I also have had some on and off mild headaches but like I said above I could just be imagining it into existence. I went in yesterday for a full eye exam and the optomologist said my eyes retina and all are in perfect condition. Because of this I am now more than ever convinced I have a brain tumor and am about to die. Sorry for the rant I just needed somewhere to vent.tldr I have been having eye problems and am worried I have all of the eye issues.,Anxiety
34344,A whole slew of problems... Normal? I've been dealing with anxiety since September specifically generalized anxiety disorder GAD. Since then I've had a few recurring symptoms that my first doctor had waved off to anxiety but since then have gotten more common. I will be talking to a new doctor soon since I need to get back on meds after my last attempt ended so I will be talking to them about this but wanted others' opinionsexperiences too for comfort especially.I had a huge fear of contracting rabies since I work with animals. I know this is not logical since any animal that has ever scratched me I've never been bit has not had rabies and since even though I exhibited some general symptoms that happened to line up with rabies I've been this way since September. So I'd be dead by now. Some of those symptoms are like I said pretty general and line up with anxietyrelated symptoms. Minor muscle twitching foggy thinking being irritable trouble swallowingdry mouth has never impaired eatingdrinking etc. I also have had a totally random symptom from those which is sharp shortlived pains in my chest and now they're along my lower abdomen and uterus. My new doctor has seen me once for chest pains when they wouldn't stop one day. She said everything sounded fine as far as my heart and lungs I wasn't experiencing limited breathing and the pain wasn't longlived and was sharp not like a pressure or anything. She was hoping it was from acid reflux which I was having issues with but after a month of medicine for that I'm still having that.Has anyone else had sharp chest pains from anxiety? I've had stomach pains from stressanxiety but have any ladies also had pains in their uterineovarian area from it? ,Anxiety
34345,New Here Hey there! So I've been lurking around for a few days and thought I should I produce myself. I'm a 33 year old stay at home mom to 2 boys. I was diagnosed with GAD at 16. I was on medicine for less than a year but quit taking it due to not liking the way it made me feel and not liking my dr so I didn't want to go back. The anxiety seemed to calm down until my second son was born. I had my first panic attack 5 years ago but thankfully don't have them often. The health anxiety started around that time too. In August 2016 I finally realized that things were getting bad and asked my gp for help for help and was put on medication and started seeing a counselor. Then my husband went through some job changes in 2017 and of course lost insurance for 3 months each time. Then in October he accepted a job offer that moved us from Texas to the Midwest. My anxiety was behaving itself during the move and I thought that just maybe it would leave me alone. No such luck. By December my anxiety was a houseguest of my brain that wouldn't leave. I made an appointment to talk to a dr next week but now I've found out that she is a clinical social worker? I currently don't have insurance but I feel that my current way of living is just not working and want to go back on the medicine. Every time I feel an ache pain tickle or sniffle I freak out. Worse I'm doing the same thing to my kids and husband. I'm hoping to find a bit of community here and maybe one day we will all be anxiety free!I'm sorry this is so long!,Anxiety
34346,Its like I am at war with my heart Hey people. 27m here. I have had panic attacks 7 years ago. I had severe anxiety for a year then I used antidepressants got a girlfriend and stabilized my anxiety for many years. I still had episodes of severe anxietystress and depression but it never turned into full blown health anxiety that triggered panic attacks and major anxiety symptoms until recently.I have been very stressed thees past months and I finally had multiple panic attacks within the span of a month. Ended up in the ER 2 times. So as a person experienced with it I thought I can overcome it more easily and systematically this time. Took some anxiety episodes like a boss started SSRIwhich elevated anxiety so far and tried to fix things again.So my last barrier was to exercise as it had been a major weapon for me to overcome my health anxiety. Today I tried to go for a run but was breathless and my chest was hurtingdue cold I guess? I don't know pretty bad. I became anxious and dizzy. My dizziness went on for hours and I think I still have it.I am 27 and I had ECGs done during 2 of my attacks where the doctor told me it is not a heart attack this past month.But this dizziness thing and basically whenever I measure my blood pressure it turning out quiet high at around 15 910 whenever I go to a doctor to have it measured is freaking me out.I feel like my body is getting severely damaged due to my constant high blood pressure and the dizziness obviously screws my functionality. I'll go to a cardiologist regardless. I went to one 6 months ago and he told me all was fine before I was having these attacks.But is it possible to have dizziness and hbp that often with anxiety? I can often see my blood pumping in the body when this state becomes very strong. I want to get back to exercisingworking out to have a normal life but I am scared that its going to be what kills me...,Anxiety
34347,Diagnosed with 2 illness' My whole life I have had severe generalized anxiety and health phobias. I have always worried there is something wrong. This started in 6th grade. I am 33 now. Everything I have worried about has never happened but I was diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome in '16 autoimmune disease that attacks moisture producing glands and more recently Hypogammaglobulinanemia an immune deficiency where my blood lacks the proteins needed to protect me against virus and infection. Has anyone else with health phobias actually been diagnosed with an illness? It's been an incredibly difficult time for me but I'm working with a psychiatrist and just started seeing a therapist who specializes in chronic illness and anxiety. I'm looking for some words of encouragement or experiences. Thanks all.,Anxiety
34348,Scared of brain amoeba Exactly one year ago I was in New Zealand where they have these geothermal pools which have a brain eating amoeba in them which is why you shouldn't inhale that water. I didn't go into one of those but I did go into a normal hot tub and scraped my knee doing so. And I sat there for a minute before realising that it was actually bleeding so I went up and cleaned the wound and put a band aid on. Then I sat back in but didn't put my knee back in. Lately I have been freaking out over this because I have been thinking a lot about health related things. I have heard that if you do get infected you will notice the symptoms really quickly but since it's been a year I should be in the clear right?,Anxiety
34349,Lump in breast...? Help? A few days ago I discovered that there's a firm ovalshaped lump ? on the side of my right breast. It's smooth and I kind of have to press firmly to feel it. There's no pain only if I press it it kind of feels like when you have a bruise and you press on the bruised area lightly. So not quite pain just kind of like a dull feeling.There are no other symptoms.Should I go to the doctor just to be safe?And in the event that it is serious how long can I afford to wait before seeing a doctor?I'm only 19 and I know breast cancer in young people is pretty rare but I can't stop worrying that I might be in that unlucky tiny minority.I'm posting this because I know little on the subject. I know that breast lumps are treated like a big deal yet logically I know it doesn't seem likely... ,Anxiety
34350,Frustrating set back with HA Looking for some support right now! My health anxiety started in the midst of some real health concerns. I was eventually diagnosed with a tumor in my pituitary and am currently taking medication to deal with that. Even so I developed severe HA concentrated around having a heart condition. I ended up in the hospital once and in urgent care half a dozen times over the course of 6 months. I also went to see my GP several times during this period. Every time an EKG was done and it came out normal. At the urging of GP I went to see a psychiatrist and therapist. Ive been on Zoloft for about 8 weeks now. The beginning was rough but lately Ive felt great. One of my biggest triggers has been my blood pressure and its been weeks since I checked it. I was checking my BP just about every 10 minutes before. I was also afraid to exert myself but have been able to start exercising again which feels great. Last night things went off the rails. My usual symptoms pain in my upper left chest arm painnumbness and crushing fear all returned. I checked my BP several times and was only able to fall asleep when I collapsed from exhaustion. I took a klonopin which I have so I can deal with panic attacks like last night. Today Ive been feeling anxious the entire day Ive resisted taking klonopin again because I dont want to become dependent on it. I feel incredibly frustrated. I have come such a long way in the last few weeks and Im afraid Im falling back into my old ways. Im going back to my psych on Friday but Im scared of spending the week in a near constant panic. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you deal with it and do you have any advice that can help? Having HA is like living in your own personal hell and I really dont feel like I can go back to what my life was like before. ,Anxiety
34351,Im trying to open up and am requesting some general advice. Im nearly 16 years old healthy and a girl. Ive never suffered from anything like depression etc. But recently my thoughts have been turning to horrible things. I get anxious about everything and everyday Im battling with my mind to stay happy for the universe. I suffer bad when Im ill from health anxiety because of my major fear of death. Its just getting worse I sit at night thinking I dont want to die and get really scared and nervous. And then I stress over school and negative thoughts overtake me. I struggle major when Im ill I cant help myself but google my symptoms its awful.My parents dont seem to get it I tried opening up about my health anxiety and they just told me to get over it. Its not as simple as that. And Im scared to open up about everything else. Any advice? ,Anxiety
34352,All of my problems I have had a lot of traumatic events these past few years. Add to that I have always been a bit of a worrier.On top of that my doctor told me I could have fibromyalgia too soon to tell. I also had a superficial blood clot in my leg recently and read online that these can be associated with deadly DVTs.I am so worried about EVERYTHING. Ever single day I am stressed and nervous. I Google health and read about these things constantly.I am not sure what I need. I guess I just want suggestions if you have any and support. I really lost it after the latest stressful event death of a family member.,Anxiety
34353,Facial weakness scare I'm usually a lurker on this subreddit and I come visit only when I have a minor disease fear. This time one thing really got me. I just realised that I can't move the lowerright half of my face as good as the lowerleft one. I don't want to exaggerate it all the muscles are responding but it looks like the left ones are just doing their job better. A part of me doesn't really care about this and would probably laugh about this situation as I'm under 25 but the other part thinks this is a sign of cancer or MS and this is the beginning of the end. I hate HA.,Anxiety
34354,The fear just keeps getting worse and I need some advice Hi allI've had health anxiety ever since I was a little kidbut this past month I have been unable to manage it anymore.I know that what I feel and fear is irrational and improbable but I can't seem to make myself truly believe this.Instead I just keep googling and freak myself out constantly.The past month I've been very paranoid about pregnancywhich is irrational in itself my last sexual contact was in october and the circumstances made pregnancy very unlikelyafter PCOS treatment completely fucked up my cycles.Two weeks ago I had an ultrasound to ease my mind and everything came back negative which relaxed me for a while.But now I can't stop worrying about an ectopic pregnancy that could rupture at any moment and kill me.The doctor only checked my uterus and ovariesand because of this I worry that she could have missed it if it was ectopic.I've been having a lot of cramps and spasms pain that goes from my neck to my shoulder and a couple weeks ago I had an episode of really bad sharp abdominal pain that I attributed to bad nutrition and stress.I know this probably sounds crazy but I can't shake the thought that there's a ticking time bomb inside of me.I'm really panicked and I just want to move on.How do I deal with this?,Anxiety

I get occasional sinus infections and every time I google them it says chance of sinus infection turning into deadly meningitis.I know legally these websites have to inform the public but it terrifies me.

34356,Googling made me think I have parasites After suffering from a really bad ear infection a cherry angioma on my lip rupturing and finding a lump in my breast I can't stop worrying about my health. I just got an ultrasound and my bloodwork done with normal results so that eased my anxiety for a bit. However my bowel movements have changed and I've been finding undigested food in my stool along with other things. I made the mistake of watching videos on intestinal parasitesworms and now I'm terrified I might have some. It's eating up so much of my time and instead of doing assignments for school I'm constantly checking my symptoms. I just wish I could stop being so stressed about it and relax but I can't.,Anxiety
34357,Constant state of fear that Im going to die. My anxiety is entirely out of control right now. I cried not too long ago knowing that my panic and my anxiety stem from irrationality nonetheless I am consistently sure 100 that I am going to die suddenly. I am very convinced that I am going to go into full cardiac arrest and Im only 31 years old. Ill feel a small pain somewhere or smell somethingtheyre all symptoms of sudden and acute heart failure. Because I think this way it makes my panic attacks just that much worse.I wish I could shut my mind down. I feel like a loser because Im this way.,Anxiety
34358,100 sure i have hiv To start it off im a 17 year old male who had unprotected sex with a women i met from the internet yeah i know im a dumbass in her 20's 48 days ago. She said she was clean and even sent me a test she took febuary 5th saying she was negative. But then she blocked me. Now she could of done that because i pissed her off constantly asking if she had hiv or she did it because she found out she did and did not want to be sued. two weeks after the sex my anxiety kicked in and i thought i had every symptom but a week later i found out that i had a 0.04 chance of contracting it so it went away. fast forward to today i am having daily headaches sometimes accompianed my nausahuge hiv sympom. i had a 98 fever for one day last week and also had a leg cramp one day and sometimes would get some aches in my arm maybe hiv or anxiety. Im scared out of my mind right now. The only reason i had sex was because i was feeling kind of depressed and thought sex would help. Little did i know that i was going to contract hiv from it . I will be a medical phenomenom i can already see the headlines 17 year old depressed boy has sex to make himself feel better ends up contracting HIV instead. I can't go to the doctor or get a test because im not 18 either. So i have to wait 4 more months until i find out i have HIv,Anxiety
34359,Found a swollen lymphnode Now Ive had health anxiety since I was 4. Ive had every cancer known to man and many other various diseases but Ive never actually had any concrete symptoms. Until 2 weeks ago.I was at work and felt a lump in my neck was extremely scared had a panic attack but I told myself it was just a lymphnode and to get over it. Ive gotten pretty good at being able to brush my symptoms off so for about two weeks I kinda forgot it was there. Until like 3 days ago when I felt my neck and it was still there! Now I dont know what to do. Ive started googling again and Im convinced I have lymphoma. Ive also now got this pain on that side of my neck that Im pretty sure is just in my head but I dont know! Im going to the doctor on Friday. Just wanted to rant I guess ,Anxiety

34361,Testicular Cancer I'm like 90 sure I have testicular cancer.. basically around 3 months ago i got a sharp pain in my testicle immediately I got worried as I never have pain there.. so I looked it up and saw testicular cancer I was shaking etc. The next day or so I was experiencing symptoms of testicular cancer.. like abdominal pain chest pain etc almost every day for like 1 and a half months so fast forward January I went to the ER because the chest pains were pretty bad same with abdominal pain etc. They did an EKG chest xray and a nurse did a physical exam on me.. so for the EKG my heart rate was kinda high also my blood pressure was high but it always has been so not really worried then I had a Chest XRay after I did that and got the results back saying all clear.. my chest pain stopped like 10 minutes later still had abdominal pain tho they did a blood test which also came back good but TC can't be detected in a common blood test. After that I got a physical exam and testicular exam the testicular exam the nurse only examined the sides and front.. by the way I have a lump on the top of my testicle didn't really tell her about it though but she said everything seemed fine.So still almost everyday I worry that I have TC.. i'm scared they could of missed something on the Chest XRay. I'm thinking about going back to the ER soon and getting a testicular ultrasound. Also right now i'm having headaches fever and my necks been hurting when I move it for about a week.. Could all of this be Health Anxiety? As some of the symptoms still persist when i'm not anxious or not thinking about it. I've also felt tired and fatigued lately.I'm 15 years old by the way.,Anxiety
34362,Anxious about appendicitis I have IBS which I know causes my stomach and lower GI pain. Which also is flared up with anxiety. So I get anxious about something I know isn't affecting me because it's just my IBS acting up which causes me to get more anxious and causes it to get worse etc. etc. It's such a vicious cycle and I don't know how to deal with it. I took Zoloft for anxiety a few months ago but I didn't like how it made me feel and I've since stopped. I don't know how to keep myself from worrying about something I clearly do not have.,Anxiety
34363,Sleeps aids for someone afraid of medication? Hey guys I've been struggling to sleep and was hoping someone could recommend a good sleep aid. Things like Zzzquil make my entire body tingly anxiety surely and sleeping pills are a big no because I feel hypersensitive to medications. When I say hypersensitive I mean I could poke a xanax with my finger and eat the tiny bit of powder that comes off and it's still sometimes a bit too strong. The placebo is just too powerful with hypochondria.So enough rambling. Any good teas or extra weak medications that could help?Thanks!,Anxiety
34364,Brain Tumor Worry Hey everyone! I'm so glad I just found this sub because I've been struggling with health anxiety for almost my entire life although it has gotten worse over the past two years. Usually I worry about stomach viruses and things related to throwing up as that is my worst fear but I've also worried about appendicitis a stroke epilepsy leg cancer and right now a brain tumor. My health anxiety has had a profound effect on my life especially in my transition to college and it often limits me from eating going out with friends and even leaving my room.I get migraines often but my most recent headache is a little different. Yesterday I had this weird pressure feeling on the top of my head and eventually got one of my normal migraines. It went away this afternoon when I took two Advil but the pressure feeling is still there. I don't know how to describe it it's not really a pain but it just feels weird and a brain tumor was my first thought. I haven't had any other typical brain tumor symptoms but I have been getting nosebleeds recently which I've heard can be related to seizures.People have told me not to be ridiculous because brain tumors are so rare. I know brain tumors are uncommon but I've known three people that have had brain cancer one of whom passed away about a year and a half ago I didn't know her very well but it was still incredibly sad. I just really hope I don't have one. Do my symptoms sound like typical brain tumor symptoms? ,Anxiety

34366,Kidney stone PAIN I went to the emergency room about a couple of months ago and they found two stones in my right kidney. One stone is small while one is 9 millimeters. They sent me home believing I can pass this stone thats 9 millimeters. Well I woke up early this morning in severe pain in my lower back. Caused my anxiety to skyrocket. I forgot that kidney stones move around and that the pain fluctuates. Its been a couple months. I just wanna have this stone go away. I just forgot how much pain one little stone can cause. Im just now worried about my kidney itself.,Anxiety
34367,It looks like I've found a home. My anxiety is ruining my life Hello everyone! So I have been suffering from severe health anxiety for years now it's about my heart. When I was 18 I fell down the stairs in my house and when I got up my heart was beating totally out of rhythm seeming at random turned out I had AFib and I had to get shocked twice back into normal rhythm. I am 22 now and have never gone back into Afib but from what doctors have told me it's only a matter of time and usually it gets more and more common until it's always there. This scares the shit out of me. On top of that for whatever reason I get SVT's when I have panic attacks so my heart just beats out of my chest and it feels awful like what I would imagine a heart attack would feel like. So now I'm scared of getting these SVT's and since I'm scared of getting them I'll panic and actually get them. Just a giant negative feedback loop. I'm on cipralex for anxiety and have been for two years but just learned from a pharmacists that it can cause even more heart rhythm issues which is the source of my current anxiety attack since the cipralex doesn't help at all anyways. How do you guys deal with this stuff? Other than with copious amounts of Ativan like I am now. Which still isn't helping. ,Anxiety
34368,Can Health Anxiety pop up seemingly out of nowhere? Is it normal to have a massivecrippling healthrelated panic attack with no history of anxiety and have Health Anxiety related symptoms occur daily after that?

34369,Heart anxiety for no reason Hello allFirst post on here there's some really good advice from people in here so hopefully someone will have been through something similar to me. I just wondered if anyone else has the same thing as me. I am anxious about having a heart issue every day and this doesn't seem to be based on anything at all. There's no family history I'm relatively young 32 have had all the heart checks available with nothing being found my cholesterol is fine and I can do mild exercise with no pain I'm pretty unfit and just started doing exercise so I'm at a mild level. I threw away my blood pressure monitor because I think it was feeding my anxiety but when I used to take it it was always in the normal range. But every day I'll feel my heart beating in my chest at random times. Sometimes when I'm lying on my side and in certain positions on the sofa. Sometimes I'll feel a strange vibration feeling in my chest. Or I'll feel my heart beat normally then seem to stop then thump back into rhythm. My partner will put her ear to my chest and tells me it's beating normally but to me it feels like it's thumping and missing beats.When I get any of those sensations I'll worry about what it means and I'll feel panicky especially if I'm on my own or in a situation that I can't escape from such as a plane or recently on the London Eye ferris wheel. Maybe it's the thought of help not being easily available to get to me. The current snow in England is making me a little panicky that help won't get to me.Along with those weird heart sensations I'll get chest discomfort like a heavy indigestion feeling sometimes odd feelings in my arm sometimes light headed feelings. None of it is painful it's just like weird sensations. I've attempted to put my chest sensations down to digestive issues such as acid reflux and I've tried eating better and exercising to improve my health but so far it hasn't made much difference.I don't know if there is something going on that no one can find or whether I'm literally doing it all to myself.I'm not an anxious person normally. I can talk in public I'm not socially anxious at all it seems to be this one and only issue and I've no idea where it came from. Does anyone else get these feelings and if so how do you ignore them and how have you managed to reduce them? ,Anxiety
34370,The flu is going around really badly at my university and I'm terrified of catching it I'm really freaking myself out a lot. I have a good immune system I normally only get one cold or so a year haven't had the stomach bug in almost 7 years knock on wood and I don't think I've ever had the flu but maybe a flu like illness or two.Anyway I'm always health anxious about things like this but it got a lot worse last week upon receiving an email that the flu is widespread and that they've been getting a large amount of cases. People in my classes claim to have it people in my clubs claim to have it etc. Luckily none of my five roommates we live and share a bathroom together have gotten it so far but I'm still so freaked out. I obviously go above and beyond with precautions hand washing before any kind of eating or touching my face probiotics Vitamin C immune supplements 1x a day lots of fruit water sleep not a lot of junk food exercise. I clean the doorknobs every day and sanitize my phone and laptop daily. I still can't help but worry.I've been taking my temperature a lot and feeling feverish but it never comes back with a fever. I've also had some trouble sleeping and I've been nauseous had a funky appetite and some questionable poops. You can catch the flu through air droplets so that's the only way I think I could ever get it but I'm still really freaked out.Any advice on how to try and relax a bit?,Anxiety
34371,I feel like I am okay I feel like I am okay in the sense that I feel stable when I think about my mental health as well as my emotional health. Physical health I am satisfied with even though I have slightly more fat than what I desire on my body. Regardless of these things I seem to be feeling well yet throughout some of my days in the week I feel anxious about something and I always get the feeling that it's regarding one of the three things I mentioned earlier mental emotional and physical. More often than ever I feel like the problem might be anxiety. I'm not sure how to deal with it or what preventative measures I can take. I'd much rather read or listen to people who have been going through the same scenario as me than to approach a health councilor. Any sort of feedback on the things that I can do or maybe even some controversial practices I can try would be of great help.. hopefullyThanks guys and gals! P.S. I feel like my anxiety is not on the level where I would need to start taking medicines for it. I would say that it is on a small level. ,Anxiety
34372,2 Swollen Lymph Nodes...still freaking out About 2 weeks ago I noticed a peasized growth under my skin in the inguinal groin region then another. Was misdiagnosed at first as a hernia went to doc and they said if i threw up go right to er. Next morning threw up 3 times from anxiety probably went to ER. They poked me said these are swollen lymph nodes better order some tests. So I got bloodwork a CT Scan and an ultrasound. Lymphoma or another cancer is my ultimate fear. Everything came back normal. Just two enflamed lymph nodes on the CT Scan. They diagnosed it a probable bacterial infection maybe given to me by the cat I got a week before all of this started. Gave me antibiotics.So I am about two weeks out from that finished my antibiotics and the nodes are still the same size. Have been to GP twice since the ER thinking I felt more nodes he said all seems normal and it could take a month for the nodes to go down and they may never go down. He says he doesn't think I have lymphoma and is almost convinced fully of it. Made the mistake of reading that only a biopsy can detect cancer so have now convinced myself I have cancer somehow despite 3 ER docs and a nurse telling me it probably wasn't. The nodes are still about the same size maybe bigger but not by much. This is kilin me.edit the doc and er doc say they are too small and superficial to even biopsy right now which makes me feel even dumber. ,Anxiety

34374,Last Saturday I jumped over a fence when I landed on my feet my knee popped out of place. Im scared I hurt it pretty bad. But I cant go to the dr. Every day now its been getting better. Every day I can bend it a little more. My parents said that its happened to them and that it takes a while to get better but it will. Im wearing a brace and taking pain medicine and using iceheat. Elevating it when I can. Even while sleeping. When it popped out of place it started swelling up and the swelling went away about 48 hours later. Now its still a sharp pain and often feels if its going to buckle when I walk too fast or the wrong way. I cant fully bend it because it feels tight and like the muscles or tendons are twisting up.

34376,HeartDiabetes anxiety for 4 years Last night when I couldn't sleep I started reading this subreddit and immediately felt some what comforted that I recognised myself in some of your stories. I thought I would share mine and get some of your imput. I think it would really help.When I was 23 and finishing up a very stressful period of writing my thesis I woke up one night completely convinced I was having a heart attack. I managed to calm myself down but every since then not a day has gone by where I don't think I could die at any second. For the most time I worry about my heart. I got pains at the top of my stomach like someone pressing two fingers right under my ribcage which the doctor said was acid reflux but in my mind it is always the worst. One time years ago I heard a commercial on the radio where a woman said I thought I was just gassy turns out I was having a heart attack!. I turned it off right away but I couldn't get it out of my head. Especially when I learned that heart attacks in women can present as stomach painsacid reflux. Everything I feel is related to my heart. Checking my pulse constantly is the new normal. It's completely exhausting. My father has since died from a heart attack and my uncle has had many stents so that its in my family history also doesn't help.My other main worry is about diabetes. Because my dad was very overweight I grew up with the family doctor telling me that if you are too heavy you Will get diabetes. Now even more so after his death I am completely terrified. I monitor how often I pee every day and if its more than usual I freak out. I get tested every couple of years but months after the last test my mind will go to 'but what if you do have it now. It will all be your fault. You did this. You're sick and it's your fault.'I have a lot to live for. I'm getting married later this year and I refuse to let few chemicals in my brain screw up my life but that voice in the back or more often than not front of my head is very hard to get rid of. ,Anxiety
34377,Recent doctor's visit has me in a spiral I don't know where else to turn. I feel like my entire world is caving in. A few days ago I went for a routine eye examination and at the end of it my doctor told me that I had an inflamed optic nerve and one pupil smaller than the other. She suspects that I might have idiopathic intracranial hypertension. She's seen this a few times. Sets me up with a specialist. Specialist calls and sets appointment some time in April. Today I get a call saying that appointment was a mistake and they need to see me next week. They used the word serious. My mind is racing now. I'm trying to calm myself down and think clearly but I can't. They're not going to diagnosis me with IIH which is a benign disease it'll be terminal brain cancer or MS. I just know it. Basically IIH makes your brain swell due to excessive spinal fluid. It gives you nasty headaches. Weight loss and meds are the treatment. I'm going to die of brain cancer at 28. This is how my life ends. This is the most convinced I've ever been in my entire life and all the history of health anxiety that I've had. This will be the end. I can't fucking believe this is happening to me. I had my appendix and gallbladder removed and had to fight the fears of intestinal cancer. Now my brain is telling me See? It took threefours to metastasize to your brain and now you're gonna die. I can't stop panicking. ,Anxiety
34378,Issue with Anxiety and Throat Hey guys First time posting but been dealing with anxiety for a while... A lot of my anxiety goes to my health... 3 years ago I began to have these extremely painful sores in the back of my throat. Went to a bunch of doctors and they couldn't tell me what was happening they said it was stress. I also got oral thrush in my throat and mouth along with headaches stomach aches flu and cold symptoms. I began to get extremely anxious with everything that I spiraled out of control. I landed myself in a psychiatric hospital by the end. I almost lost my job my wife and my life because of it. Turned out I wasn't crazy but was having an adverse reaction pyhsical and mental to mold in our apartment we had recently moved into before my symptoms popped up. Every thing gradually got better my anxiety went way down... my health returned....But the one side effect was my throat became extremely sensitive. It easly scratches and a white scab will form while it heals. But my anxiety self that pops up during this time will freak out and go into PTSD mode remembering all the bad memories. I impulsively have to check my throat and look at any injuries a lot during the day and even sometimes take a Qtip and touch the area and see if the scab come off just to make sure it isn't one of those sores like before. Anyway I just wanted to know if anyone has gone through something similar and of anyone has some coping techniques that might help yes I see a therapist and whatnot as well. Getting sick or feeling like I'm getting sick extremely stresses me out as well because of these issues. Thanks everyone!,Anxiety
34379,Can't stop obsessing.. Any tips? Sorry if this is a little long but I'm new here and desperately looking for some advice. Plus it kinda helps to get it all off my chest.. I've been struggling with health anxiety for a little while now and although I keep kidding myself that I'm in control I don't feel very in control. I can't stop the constant worrying and obsessing.It all started just over a year ago when I spent a week in hospital. I'm not going to go into detail as to why as I don't want to trigger anyone else's anxiety... But it wasn't a great week.Since then I've been fine. I have ibs which is unfortunate as the symptoms I get seem to really trigger my anxiety. But that's the most serious problem I have. A few other minor things asthma skin problems but nothing unmanageable.I noticed my anxiety levels shifting around a year on from my hospital stay. Think it must have just been on my mind then I had a really bad ibs flare up that threw me. Was off my food had no energy and lots of other unpleasant things.Ibs is more under control now but my anxiety is not. I feel anxious in general have quite a foggy head alot of the time don't really feel like myself don't want to do much getting tired out easy feel like crying alot. But mostly I'm struggling because I can't stop obsessing about every little thing wrong with me.The slightest cramp or ache sends me spiraling into a panic. I can't stop googling things to find out if there is something wrong with me. Even though I don't really have any ongoing symptoms and they are more one offs. Can't stop poking and prodding looking for lumps or enlarged lymph nodes.Any time I find the tiniest little lump found one or two in the fat layer on my stomach I obsess. Can't seem to stop looking for it to see if I can find it again. Most of the time I can't any if I find anything it's tiny so logically I know it's nothing to worry about. But I just can't stop.It really feels like it's taking over. I just feel like I'm stuck in an endless obsessive cycle of prodding being hyper aware of every tiny sensation looking for things wrong with me a constantly googling.It's got to the point that when I have a nice symptom free day I find myself looking for something that's wrong with me as I feel like i can't trust that I'm actually ok.Anyone got any advice or been in a similar situation? This isn't something I find easy to open up about but I'm scared it's going to completely consume me if I don't do something. ,Anxiety

34383,How do I get over wanting everyone to like me? I am a 20yearold male. I have social anxiety disorder and one of my biggest problems with social anxiety is that I am a people pleaser. I rely on external approval from other people to make me feel good. For example when someone gives me a dirty or unfriendly look I get upset. When someone doesn't smile at me I think it's because they think something is wrong with me. When people smile at me or are friendly to me I get happy. I have this attitude that I want everyone to like me. I'm trying to change this attitude. I want to get to a point where I don't care if someone dislikes me or not. How can I get to that point?,Anxiety
34384,Convinced I'm dying from visiting auto body shop Hi everyoneSo basically Im freaking out because Im thinking about how I used to visit my estranged dads body shop from time to time growing up during the summer. I cant imagine that I would have gone more than 1015 times or so in a given summer and some years I probably only went a couple of times others none at all.I would go to work with him to washvacuum cars answer the phone and sometimes wetsand cars. However there would be times where I would follow him around to his back shop to check on his employees. Or I would go back there to let him know that a customer was waiting for him. Im currently freaking out bc I cant imagine that being in that environment while guys were doing work could have been good for me even though I wasnt doing any sanding or painting myself. His back shop is rather large and he would keep his garage doors open for ventilation httpsimgur.comFviJwNq see building on the left. I think I remember a couple of times in the winter I was there and he had the doors shut though. I probably opened the door to the paint booth a handful of times to scream in there that someone was waiting for him.My biggest fear is that Ill wind up getting cancer or something years down the line from now. I probably first went to his shop when I was 5 and stopping visiting after I was 18 or 19. I have no idea how secondhand exposure to this stuff works. Does this limited secondhand exposure to dustpaint as a kid pretty much guarantee problems down the road? Or does that typically require years of direct exposure?Was my dad 100 in the wrong for letting me come to work with him in the first place? Part of me thinks that its quite common for kids to go their familyowned businesses but still.Its gotten to the point where these thoughts dominate my mind and its very difficult to care about anything since I feel like Im dead anyway.I think its entirely possible that Im overreacting and this anxiety is brought on by the fact that I just graduated college and started my first job.Can someone please let me know what they think?Edit I found some pictures of his shop so that you can see what the environment was like for what its worth httpswww.facebook.compgSuddenImpactAutobodyINC161287353937984photos?refpageinternal,Anxiety

34388,Worried about ovarian cancer HelloIm new to this subreddit but deff not new to health anxiety. Im 26 and 5 years ago my gyno basically diagnosed me with PCOS. My periods have been irregular for the better part of 56 years but lately have been regular...maybe a few days off. Well last month my anxiety started to get really bad. I was having panic attacks daily and didnt sleep well. A few days ago I started worrying that I have ovarian cancer bc I was bloated. It ended up subsiding but now my period is due meaning this date range is when I usually get it and I have lower back cramping pelvic cramps bloating but no bleeding.

34389,Im experiencing calf pain after a loonnnggg bus ride. DVT? Hi everyone First of all Im a 27yo female who is pretty active and in general good health. I am taking oral contraceptives so I am at a higher risk of clots. Ive been taking the same birth control pill for 10 years without any trouble. I recently went on a trip and was on a bus for 15 hours straight. I did walk around or stand up every few hours or so. I also had the seat next to me for myself so i was able to extendraise my legs and stretch out. I was very hydrated during that trip. Once I got to my destination everything was okay. I had to get back on the bus to go home which was only going to be 5 hours the first one took so long due to weathertraffic. I walked around about half way through my return trip but i did notice my lower legs started to hurt towards the end of my trip. Also i admit i definitely wasnt drinking as much water as i probably shouldve. Its been 24 hours now and Im experiencing mild pain in my lower left leg. My calf just seems crampy. It hurts a little when i flex my toes up to the sky that also hurts on the other leg as well. I do feel slight muscle spasms in my other leg but no pain. I have no noticeable swelling or warmth on my legs. The crampy feeling sort of extends to my thigh as well but i do have sciatica so Im not sure if thats what Im feeling. I can walk totally fine and have no pain when doing so. I mostly feel this pain when i am sitting or laying down. Id love some advice on whether or not i should go to the ER to be safe or if its just likely my muscles are dehydrated and sore from being stuck in a relatively small area for a while. ,Anxiety

34391,Itchy vagina anxious nighttime scratching NOT STI related. Advice wanted. I scratch my vagina a lot. I do it most before bed and often wake up in the middle of the night scratching. I scratch when I'm watching Netflix and anytime I'm 'idle.' I get the urge to scratch sometimes at work but very rarely when I'm busy or out having fun.I've been tested for STIs and yeast and bacterial infections many times it's none of these things.The scratching problem also affects my anus but to a lesser extent.When I get the urge to scratch it's like a twitch that I can't ignore. Once I start scratching I find it very hard to stop. I feel relief when I scratch until I scratch so much that I tear the skin and it begins to hurt and bleed. When I'm scratching I notice that I'm usually holding my breath and my body is tense.My suspicion is that it's an anxious behaviour and now that I've suffered for over 4 years it's become an unconscious 'tick' that I can't kick.I tried acupuncture and only experienced a mild improvement from 1 of my total 5 sessions. The improvement didn't last.Has anyone else suffered from this condition? Any and all advicepersonal stories would be so very appreciated. ,Anxiety

34397,Inhalated ACrefrigerant chemicals Today I was in sitting in a lounge area of a building at my university for about 10 minutes. All of a sudden someone who happens to be the professor of a class I'm in walks by and asks Does it smell like burning plastic in here to anyone else?. I took a whiff and lo and behold there was a very strong odor. A repair man eventually determined the problem to be that the HVAC system was leaking fluids into the ventilation. I left the building soon after the professor made his remarks but I did return briefly a couple times to see if it had gotten better and to retrieve the laptop I left there. Since then this was about an hour ago I've kinda been feeling a weird sensation in my lungs or possibly my esophagus not sure. How worried should I be about chemical inhalation etc.?,Anxiety
34398,I don't wanna jump to conclusions but I'm a little worried about diabetes Just recently I have started to have trouble sleeping. My schedule and everything has been a little messed up. I sleep for like 3 hours wake up and can't go back to bed for a couple of hours while I feel decently thirsty and hungry. Eventually I fall back asleep for another couple or hours and wake up not able to sleep until the next time. So after I have finnaly accumulated a normal amount of sleep I will eventually get up but I don't really feel that great but I don't necessarily feel that bad. For the past twothree days it seems to have been weird. The first day it was the same cycle except I woke feeling pretty aweful. Headache not well rested and tired. The second day I didn't really get a full 78 of rest so for most of the day I felt like I was on the verge of falling asleep if I had any downtime of not doing really anything. That night I decided I would get a full night's rest in one full go as usual. I fell asleep pretty easy but I woke up like 4 hours later having to pee pretty bad and feeling thirsty. I was able to immediately go back to bed though. I awoke 3 more hours later feeling as if I have to pee again not as bad this time BUT my thirst was pretty intense. I chugged some water went to the bathroom and gone back to bed. So I'm kind of afraid that this could be diabetes or something. I'm not overweight but I'm definitely not active. My eating habits aren't too great either. I eat good foods but most definitely eat a lot of bad foods.TLDR I'm not sleep well. Waking up in the middle of the night feeling thirsty and having to pee. Thirst exclusive to night. ,Anxiety
34399,HEALTH ANXIETY SYMPTOMS Hi guys they said I have health anxiety but I can't believe them because the symptoms are very real. Sometimes I don't know if this is really anxiety. I went to hospital a lot of times and they said they don't find anything aside from my tubercolosis. But my doctor said that my TB is just mild and I don't have cough so it's not a reason yet to give me shortness of breath. I also had three ECG's and it all came up normal.It is really possible that you wIll just experience anxiety symptoms without any reason? Like I'm just playing computer and suddenly I can't breath.

34400,I could use some reassurance. Swollen lymph node getting a biopsy Friday I have been having reoccurring sinus infections due to a tooth that needed a root canal. During that time I went to an ENT who told me that my nose was a bit crooked and that was another reason. While I was there I thought I'd ask him about a lymph node in the back of my neck. When I first discovered it I thought it was a knot in a muscle so I tried to massage it out but it never went away. Eventually I asked my GP about it and he said not to worry unless it grows. I don't think it has.I told him that it had been there for at least 2 years but more likely 34 years. He asked if it was stable and I said yes but he wanted to get an ultra sound. The ultra sound tech said she thought it was just a lymph node. I asked if she thought there was cancer in it and she didn't think so but would let my ENT make that call. I went to the follow up and he mentioned the ultra sound doctor thinking it was a lymph node but wanted to get a needle point biopsy on it. He said that 910 times it was nothing but he would be a bad doctor if he didn't check. This triggered my health anxiety. What if I'm that 110? My brother had lymphoma when he was 27 and I'm 31. So I'm terrified. I poked it and it got harder and my neck got sore and now I can't stop checking it even though I know I need to. I'm trying not to push on it and just brush my hand across it but it's still there and it's still freaking me out. A few weeks ago I had a routine physical and my blood work was normal. My white blood cells were high but they were at 8 and the range was 110 was normal. My GP didn't think anything was wrong aside from minor cholesterol stuff that he put me on vitamins for.So I'm getting the biopsy on Friday and following up on Wednesday to get the results. But in the meantime I'm spiraling here and looking for reassurance or help. I don't feel sluggish aside from being tired I have a very active 11 month old baby. My color is good no fever no night sweats. I have chest pain but that's just anxiety that comes and goes with my panic attacks. My appetite is fine. My blood work came back fine.

After finally getting a nearly clean bill of health I brought up with my doctor the one thing I didn't think about until recently. I could feel a swollen lymph node just under my jaw over my carotid artery. what started to scare me is that i realized I could feel that lymph node for something like 3 months. My doctor immediately ordered an ultrasound and this morning I got a really somber call from a nurse at the Dr.'s office saying I needed to see an ENT right away I not only have the one but multiple enlarged lymph nodes in that area. My understanding is that the concern from my doctor is not just that there are multilple and they're enlarged at least one is on the order of 2cm but that at least one has persisted for so long and even more alarming I have no signs of an infection and my bloodwork is clean apparently persistent enlarged multiple lymph nodes with clean bloodwork is not a good sign.I've been freaking out all day and I've been trying to avoid the internet but the soonest I can get in to see an ENT is next Tuesday so I get to spend the next 4 days agonizing about this. I'm 38 years old and I've been through so many health symptom scares over the past couple of months mostly heart related that the anxiety is just making me lose my mind...,Anxiety

I hope this won't be too much since i do tend to overshare when i'm depressed and i am depressed at the moment.I've been anxious and obsessive ever since i can remember. Couple of years ago i was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and major depression as well as BPD. Two years ago i was also diagnosed with AvPD and OCPD. I went through DBT two times a third time is already scheduled. I was in therapy for over 5 years but i have to quit. I've also been on Pregabalin for two years.Health Anxiety started last year for me after I had finally cut ties with an emotionally abusive friend who basically made the past four years a living hell. I don't know if that was the cause but it happened around the same time. I've always grinded my teeth at night and i was wearing a mouth guard ever since that was discovered. However recently i lost mine as i lost my bag during traveling which has caused a lot of stress for me over the past week as losing things is something i've always been anxious about so the grinding has been worse. Thanks to my medication i have a very dry mouth and to top that off i also currently have a very bad cold that's already got me on edge wether i'm developing pneumonia. Yesterday night was a very bad time for me. While brushing teeth my gums were bleeding a lot i have very good oral hygiene my doctor has never had any complaints and my gums never bleed so brushed my teeth used mouth wash and then went to sleep trying to not go into the anxiety cycle again. After that however instead of falling asleep I spend hours googling things and being caught up in memories of said former abusive friend. I don't know where that came from but it just overwhelmed me. Today i found a tiny black spot on my teeth that won't go away. It looks like a tiny hole. And instead of listening to what i learned in therapy i should've known better i googled again. Turns out you can get cavities from grinding your teeth and wearing them down. I am fairly certain this is what's going on and i've scheduled an appointment for Monday. And now i'm trying to find ways to get through the weekend without too much stress because i'm worried that might make my cold even worse and... you all probably can guess how the cycle spirals downwards from here.The thing i wanted to say about all this is the following This sucks. Majorly. I am so tired of this anxiety this obsessive overthinking of everything my body does i'm tired of all these bad things that happened in the past still haunting me to this day. I'm tired of all the diagnosis i got it feels like there's no chance of recovery because of all the things i have to work through. And i'm also tired of being aware that stress will wear my body down but that thought alone is causing me so much stress that it's a long spiral i can't seem to escape from. This right now feels like another punishment for not getting this right. I'm trying not to be too negative but the thoughts keep forming in my head. Sometimes i just wish i could start anew because after i learned in therapy just exactly how all my problems started and how they escalated i just wish i could redo my life and stop the anxiety before it even got this bad. I will continue to work through this. As we all do. I know that me wishing for a new start will never come to be and maybe that wouldn't even be for the best. I know i'm not and neither is anyone else here responsible for this condition. Right now it just felt like the thoughts were overwhelming me and i needed to tell someone. I know this can be beat i just feel at a low point right now.If you read this thank you for listening to me.,Anxiety
34411,Something wrong with my ears My ears pop very easily for some reason. It started when I was 6. I always reequalize when my ears pop by holding my nose closed and sucking in.

34412,Difference between real symptoms and psychosomatic made symptoms? I ask this because I have been going through something extremely odd in the last year. All my medical tests suggest I am perfectly healthy but the symptoms I have been facing with are unlike anything I have experienced before. I am not just talking about your typical anxiety attack and heart palpitations but a constant state of bizarre sensations. My symptoms are severe insomnia Constant irritability Confusion and brain fog what I perceive as working memory issues muscle spasmsjerks vision hearing and skin hypersensitivityI am not looking for a diagnosis just understanding the line between a medical condition and something that is just anxiety.,Anxiety
34413,Was doing so well until right now I started a new medication a month or so ago and it seems to have quashed the intensity of my health anxiety. I was overjoyed about this! Finally I had hope of living a life that wasnt steered by hypochondria! But Im currently having a setback.Long story short Ive been under a lot of stress lately. My girlfriend who I was really in love with broke up with me last week. That seems to be the major issue right now. But Im getting some troubling symptoms.All day Ive had this weird pain in my chest. I attributed this to emotional pain and didnt think too much of it. Now Im also feeling it in my back and the pain is more to the left side of my chest. I am having some left arm pain as well and it almost feels like some weakness too but I cant tell if this is my mind playing tricks on me. My heart is pounding and Im feeling a little lightheaded. I just feel off.So the 2 things Im worried about are a heart attack or something called Broken Heart Syndrome which is a very real condition and has been proven to exist.Im not asking for a diagnosis of course but has anyone else experienced something like this?,Anxiety

34415,Cat scratched behind my ear Hi all life long health anxiety sufferer history of as many as 45 ER visits in one year. Had it somewhat under control but the last 6 months I went thru a very hard time w my mental illness CPTSD and is flatingup again. Saturday my indoor cat scratched me pretty badly behind my ear my fault he hates being picked up. I made her mistake of reading online and found articles of people whose hearts have stopped and died from infected cat scratched. Its now Friday and I spent the week completely distracted from my life . Today I was supposed to work a double shift but I was so distracted and anxious at work I just left and am now at emergency. I have no idea how long Ill be here prob a long time. I feel like Ive created most of mhm symptoms fatigue anxiety is exhausting sore throat I smoked a lot on the weekend. Chest pains anxiety. I have no fever just saw 36.9 . Feeling like maybe I should just leave and go back to work as I feel dumb being here but Im too scared. Ughhh ,Anxiety
34416,Scared of Klinefelters I seem to have alot of the symptoms for it low confidence Insecure and anxious and emotional I didn't fit in and I admittedly have some feminine behaviors and I can't grow that much hair. im 17 though I have hair on my lower feet and the hair on my arms are coming in I guess I got wide hips but I got big shoulders and I'm tall. I can only grow facial hair on mustache and chin though it takes a month or two to become somewhat fullish looking but my dad didn't grow facial hair until he was 22. As a kid I was described as somewhat masculine never picked up girl toys and etc but I guess that doesn't really matter. The doctors diagnosed me as autistic when I was 7 and people sometimes confuse Klinefelter behavior for autism but I have a high verbal IQ and I can type fast. My IQ is 100 but Idk. I'm going to get my testosterone tested soon this Monday i'm hoping i'm going to ask the doctor about it. But I'm really terrified and anxious because this would mean everything I thought in my life up until now would be a lie and I also wont be able to have any kids which is the number one thing I want in life is to have kids. The symptoms of Klinefelters seems to vary so I'm just worried on having it the only thing I really care is about the most is if I'm able to have kids with my girlfriend. I'm just making this post here to vent sorry if its a bit of a nuisance I'll delete it soon. EDIT Yeah I also have a history of hypochondria I'm just really worried. ,Anxiety

34418,Really worried about my kidneys. Any advice? I'm a 20 year old male 5'7 130lbs. I got blood work done and it found my Ferritin to be high at 328 ugL and B12 high at 658 pmolL and high LDL cholesterol at 3.39 mmolL. My eGFR is 88 with Creatinine at 105 umolL and magnesium at 0.99 mmolL. My urine came back negative for protein blood and nitrite. A week later I had Ferritin tested again and it was 427ugL. I also had an abdominal ultrasound which showed regular kidneys but a 3mm ployp was found on my gallbladder. It sound be noted that all the test I've done thus far has not been for my kidneys but a pain in my abdomen which I'm seeing a GI specialist for. Should I though look into my kidneys? As these findings from what I've read may seem normal for an older person but not a 20 year old. Also would working out hard just over 24hr before the test affect the results? Or a meat heavy diet dispite a 12hr fast? Thanks Also my grandma had polycystic kidney disease but from my understanding it was not the heredarity type.,Anxiety
34419,This morning I found what may be a bald spot which naturally confirmed all of my fears that I have lupus and Im dying. Just an average Saturday! I am so happy I found this sub if for anything else to know that Im not the only one out here. I always do this...I work to ignore little things day after day that could be symptoms of something bigger until suddenly I find that one thing that affirms that Ive been negligent and now Ill pay the price. Ive been in the obsession spiral since 11am today. I recently gave myself an undercut and I checked the back of my head in the mirror before leaving the house to get lunch and noticed a huge spot of hair missing at my neckline. By the time I got to the restaurant I was on a website confirming that I do in fact have lupus and sobbing while playing the conversation in my head of having to tell my mother.For a moment I break through the cloud and say look at yourself! You noticed what MIGHT be a bald spot and now you definitely have lupus?? Get out of the spiral. Youre fine. Then I fall right back in. How dare I enjoy this hot dog right now like nothing is wrong!? I have lupus for gods sake. Its so bewildering how it takes this hold. So now Ill work to distract myself until I can see a doctor or the 800th time I check my hairline I can somehow convince myself that the spot has always been there and my hairline is just uneven. Thanks for existing and listening lt3,Anxiety
34420,I feel like an idiot for posting here but here goes Brain tumorcancer worries I feel like a dummy but I've definitely suffered from health anxiety in the pastpregnancy scares with my ex lymphoma scares diabetes scares etc so I'm hoping this is just another case of me being a hypochondriac.For the past 2 weeks or so I've had this strange feeling in my head. I can't really call it a headache its more of a pressure that can be felt throughout my head and sometimes more on the top. I wouldn't say its painful just a really annoying feeling. I also feel somewhat of a pressure type feeling in my ears from time to time with associated tinnitus. I've had minor hearing losstinnitus before this headache started but obviously Dr. Google has indicated to me that this could be a tumor. I saw my doctor about it last week and he said that its more likely a tension headache but that if the symptoms continued and I was still worried he'd order a head CT for me have a physical exam scheduled in a few days. I have no other symptoms or problems and I'm a pretty damn healthyactive 23 year old.I guess i dont know what I'm asking for here maybe just words of support from other people who have experienced something similar? The anxiety over this is killing me and there is no real reason for me to be so stressed. Am I being stupid or are my concerns legitimate? Unfortunately I'm having trouble trusting my PCP...the lymphoma scare I mentioned earlier was the result of me feeling a lump in my neck which he diagnosed as a cyst turns out it was actually an enlarged lymph node after an ultrasound was done,Anxiety
34421,Do any of you ever feel like you break through the anxiety for a minute And then it comes right back? Sometimes Ill just be talking with my bf and realize how illogical I sound which is incredibly liberating to be wrong about my health concerns since we all assume the worst. I will just cry a lot because its like the person I was before my health anxiety was able to break through for a second and hold a mirror to my thoughts. I try so hard to hold onto that feeling. But anxiety is too powerful sometimes and I cant help googling asking my bf to look at something on my body or simply thinking about death. Im so much better than last year and the year before but my anxiety is still there. I just want to be normal. I want to be like my bf or anyone else without health anxiety,Anxiety
34422,So tired of always fearing the worst Ive been experiencing some digestion issues this week and I know deep down that its probably because Ive been home from college and eating much moremuch greasier food than usual but I cant escape the thoughts that its something much worse. Even though Ive looked up symptoms and have nothing in common with any of them except for the ones I know Im probably just imagining it still makes me so scared. Nothing to do but wait it out and see what happens when Im back in school I guess hopefully it just all goes away. I hate feeling this way and I know my familySO hate it too is there anything that you all do to help with these feelings? ,Anxiety

34424,Can't gain weight? Okay so I'm gonna preface this by saying that I used to weigh almost 200 pounds. In the past year I've lost 50ish pounds and I'm at a healthy weight for my height. I did restrictive diets to lose weight but at this point I'm working out so if I gain weight I don't really care because I know I won't gain weight in my stomach. There's just one problem. In September I had my gallbladder removed. I'm not supposed to be eating oily food but I'm a teen so of course I'm going to. The first month after my surgery I ate like a pig and I didn't exercise. I lost 10 pounds. I have bulimia but I'm in recovery and I don't purge often at all like only 12 times a month when I relapse. At this point I literally can't stop eating. I'll be full as hell but I still can't stop. I've recorded it and I've been eating about 35004000 calories a day for the past few weeks according to my Fitbit I only burn about 2200. I haven't gained a pound. All I've done is lost 12 pounds a week. I should also mention that I have super low blood pressure the doctors don't know why I eat salty stuff all the time. Every time I stand up I get lightheaded and spotty vision and I have to lean against something. I don't know what to do. Any medical professional that I talk to about this says that I'm just a teen with a high metabolism. But I've had to lose weight in the past so I don't understand.,Anxiety
34425,Anyone tried exposure therapy? My therapist says that exposure therapy is one of the best ways to treat health anxiety disorder which we're starting on Thursday. Just wondered how many of you are currently receiving treatment of any kind and how many have tried this particular modality.

34427,Healthy Anxiety worst nightmare! gt HPV Hi AllA year ago I found out that I had a wart in my throat possibly linked to HPV. It was removed and biopsy confirmed as benign. HPV specifically HPV16 found to be a major risk factor for oralthroat cancers possibly contracted by kissing oral sex towels and other methods.It triggered major health anxiety within me and my life practically ended. I quit my job I stopped any type of intimate relationships and basically waiting for life to have a miserable cancer ending.I did about 10 times oral sex in my life in total about 5 different women and now I'm certain I contracted HPV in my throat according to the statistics that everyone got that virus.I don't even know if I should vaccinate I'm 36 because the manufacturer itself says it could increase the risk of cancer if you already got infected with HPV16HPV18.Yes I know in 90 the immune system clears it in the rest of the cases you are as good as dead.There is no cure there is no test and I'm positive I'm headed for cancer. I tried doctors GPs ENTs CBT therapists alternative therapists nothing works for me.My life is practically over.I considered to start taking AHCC pills which women and some preliminary trial claim can help clear HPV faster just in case I did contract it I can never know.,Anxiety

34429,Does weed trigger intense panic attacks for anyone else? There was a time where I'd smoke weed and it would make me socially inept but also incredibly relaxed and I could just sit and play a game for hours. I haven't smoked since 2015 though I've gotten a slight second hand high from sitting in a car with my friendsI recently figured I might as well try some as I've had trouble falling asleep and I don't want to use heavier drugs to get to bed. Well I smoked a small amount but immediately it made my heart beat so hard it almost felt painful. I had a minor panic attack but after a few minutes I went to bed.This morning a friend used a knife of mine to cut dabs and some dab residue was left on the knife I figured I might as well gum it and see if it does anything and then go to bed. I awoke an hour after passing out to find my heart rate was incredibly high and it was also beating weakly. I felt tired dizzy and panicked out of my mind. I sent an embarrassing string of texts to my two closest friends and heavily debated going to the ER. I had drank a fair bit the night before and I take 5HTP for anxiety and I was worried I'd given myself serotonin syndrome or that my heart was somehow damaged.After a while I went to bed and woke up 6 hours later I've phoned in to work and am spending the night recouping but I still feel off. Over the past 3 weeks I've been feeling like I'm going to die somehow. Whether it's by alcohol serotonin syndrome a really bad anxiety attack or something else.It's all coming back to me as my 1 year anniversary of getting HA rolls around I started having panic attacks at this point last year. This was my worst episode yet and I felt absolutely insane. I can't stand not knowing whether I'm okay or not. For the whole day I once again have been super conscious of my heart.Hopefully I can fight this off once again I guess it's going to be an ongoing battle.,Anxiety
34430,Swollen lymph nodes for years driving me up the wall. Ugh Hello! I just found this sub and it's so nice to know it isn't just me. This month has been full of health issues and to try to make it a long story short an eating disorder gave me a ton of symptoms that I didn't even consider were from not eating such as really bad nerve pain dizziness lethargy LOTS of weight loss etc. I was POSITIVE the nerve pain positioned right over my left chest was a heart attack and went to the ER at 4am. They did an EKG a blood test urine test a full physical and xray. Everything was aokay aside from malnutrition and general ED signs.I started eating regularly and every symptom went away completely. I feel healthier than I have in a long time go figure. eating helps and I felt reassured and content for about 3 weeks. This all started on the 23rd of last month.But now I have a swollen rock hard lymph node under my chin I've never had before that is sore and a few big but squishy ones on the sides of my neck along with the muscles on the sides of my jaw being sore I grind my teeth possible cause? Something else that is important to note is I had shingles at around age 15 with very swollen and painful lymph nodes and a lot of them never went down. I'm 22 now and can't remember a time when they weren't swollen and occasionally painful but for some reason NOW I'm convinced I have lymph node cancer and can't stop freaking out about it because a new one popped up. I also have yet to gain any weight back but maybe it just hasn't been long enough yet. Panic attacks are becoming a regular occurrence. Has anyone experienced lymph nodes swollen for 7 years? I would have way more symptoms than just pain and swelling if it was cancer right? I just need some reassurance or tips I think. Thank you so much and I hope you all have a good anxiety free night.,Anxiety
34431,Rabies Anxiety Ive had a series of hypochondriac scares over the past few years but most recently Ive been concerned about rabies. About ten days ago I let my indoor cat out in the backyard to sun herself and I caught her hissing at what I think is a neighbors cat that had jumped over the fence. I didnt want them to get in a fight so I shood the other cat away and waited outside for my cat to calm down. After about ten minutes I picked up my cat to bring her inside and she freaked out and bit me. Since then the though that she might have given me rabies has been constantly on my mind causing a great deal of anxiety. I know that my cat is vaccinated she was given a 3 year booster 2 and 12 years ago and the neighbor cat was not rabid. I know that rabies especially from cat to humans is very rare in the US. I know that Im being absolutely ridiculous but knowing that doesnt help. I keep thinking maybe the booster wore off prematurely or the neighbor cat did have rabies and my cat bit her before biting me. It doesnt help that I woke up today with a headache and a sore throat two early symptoms of rabies and that Ive been having nightmares where I loose my mind and become aggressive. Im not sure exactly what to do about this or what this post is supposed to do. Im on lexapro for general anxiety and OCD tendencies. I guess I just want to be told Im a healthy idiot. ,Anxiety

I hear its dangerous to consume a pill that is crushed or broken down because it gives you large dosage at once. The good part is that I didnt swallow even half of what was inside the flomax pill.

34439,I'm convinced I may have blood clots in my leg. At the start of the week the box spring of my bed caved in while I was sleeping. I didn't notice this as I'm a deep sleeper. When I woke up I realized this and noticed my lower back was in great pain and my right leg felt like it was on the verge of cramping. It wasn't impossible to walk just difficult and I assumed it was mostly because of my back. A day later my leg is in great pain and I'm only able to be comfortable in very specific situations. This time I can only walk a little due to the pain increasing. I still figured it was just some sort of leg cramp waiting to happen but I kept noticing a pulsating sensation in my thigh and shin. I replaced my box spring and was able to rest somewhat even though the pain is very noticeable. The morning of the third day I was woken up by the pain in my leg. I can walk but at this point it's unbearable. It's as if I'm experiencing a perpetual leg cramp. I look into my symptoms a bit and can no longer shake the fear that I may have developed blood clots after my box spring caved in so I arrange for someone to take me to the hospital I couldn't drive. This was sheer agony as it has become impossible for me to sit upright. Despite the fact that they recognized I was in great pain the doctor didn't perform an ultrasound. She told me I had no symptoms of a blood clot and that I just had a muscle spasm. I was prescribed baclofen meloxicam and lisinopril slightly unrelated it seems I had high blood pressure on three consecutive visits and apparently this was a cause for concern. I went home took the pills and tried to sleep thinking all I could do was rest. I wake up a few hours later to find the pain is even worse and my right foot is tingly. I had to get a second opinion. I arrange for a second trip to a different hospital and again they recognized how much pain I was in and rushed me through. The only problem was...this doctor seemed almost apathetic. I explained the situation and he wanted to know exactly why I thought I have blood clots and I told him about the numerous articles I read. This prompted a quiet dismissive response very frustrating because I'm not the type to frantically rush to the hospital out of paranoia alone and just like the other doctor he told me I had no symptoms of a blood clot. Well...it's the fourth day I've done nothing but try to rest and now I'm forced to take pain pills yet I can still feel the pain regardless. What am I supposed to do if I have blood clots? Am I supposed to wait until my leg is the size of a log before it becomes an issue? I mean shouldn't they have at least checked to be safe?,Anxiety

I had a whole physical a couple weeks ago. I know I got to work on weight and diet. However bp was great urine no sugar or blood. Bloodwork will take a couple days to get back. I addressed all my heart anxiety fears. Got an EKG too and the doctor said I had pretty pqrts or whatever its called.I do have Hashimotos but not on medicine as of right now.I have suffered from anxietydepression past 18 years Im 35 now. It was SOOOO bad. Frequent trips to doctors ER urgent cares. Every single possible test done. I have always been okay. Then I was okay for a long while. Or at least all my symptoms became manageable.I was wondering if there was anyone to talk to about this. Why do I IMMEDIATELY think Im dying? Why do I feel like Ive failed when Ive been alright for many years. Why do I physically feel something and think Im for sure dying?Last night I had a headache and convinced myself it was a stroke. I spent an hour staring in the mirror and doing self administered stroke tests. Today I feel like little pings of pain but not really even pain but not a shock feeling either just feel something mostly in my right armhand. I am trying to tell myself its not a heart attack. I just want to know Ill be okay. I wish every day I could brush things off or rationalize it better. I sometimes can and then there are times like this where Im freaking out on the inside. The funny thing is in my day to day life I function. Im a mom I have a job. I also happen to have a husband who has been battling cancer for the last 2 years. I do what I have to do. But inside my head I feel like a prisoner because it is so consuming. Lastly I have started therapy again and I am hopeful that will help again.Thank you for reading this and listening to me and I am fully aware how crazy some of what Ive said sounds. The rationalsane part of me is over feeling and thinking this way,Anxiety

34449,Hard lymph nodes on mastoid bone and back of neck. Hello Reddit.Im a 28male6'7200lbs.For months now I've had two rock hard lymph nodes behind my ear on the mastoid bone. On top of that I've had one right next to my spine on the back of my neck right around my hairline. I've been having some neck pain and headaches non stop for three months. I've also noticed I have some brownish skin spots in my hairline. I've also noticed if I dig my fingers down in my skin near the node in my neck it feels like I can grab this round lump.I've been to the doctors and they brushed it off. they assured me its not canceris or anything like that. They me on some antibiotics a few months ago and it did nothing. They're not red or painful. They're hard and kind of fixed in place. They aren't growing either. They've been the same size the whole time.I get this is a long shot but I'm not sure what to do. Could the ones behind my ear be rock hard because it's right on the mastoid bone?,Anxiety
34450,Chest pain insomnia ugh All day I was experiencing intermittent chest pain near my heart. Knowing I have anxiety I always try my best to give random aches and pains a chance to subside but it gets really hard at night. Now I keep waking up and feeling it and worse now I feel this weakness like my blood sugar or blood pressure is off. I just had a regular wellness exam about a month or so ago and my blood pressure is always low so I know it's ridiculous to think I suddenly have some kind of heart disease but oh my god I can't sleep for more than 30 minutes at a time and its killing me! Unfortunately I just moved recently and I absolutely hated the doctor I saw at my union's preferred primary care provider and they are closed on weekends anyways. So I'm pretty much just stuck stressing and worrying. Please let this go away tomorrow! How's everyone else doing tonight? ,Anxiety
34451,Health anxiety in PEAKS So.. Im 21 now and I have crazy health anxiety from the past two years. When I was 13 my mother was diagnosed with Leukemia..shes fine now but I never came out of that trauma. Im really happy to have her by my side and I feel like I am the luckiest today.. but it has left a very bad effect on me. Everyday I feel like I have a disease developing inside of me..Im really really scared of cancer and any life threatening disease.. every week I have a new symptoms to worry about. I have constant heart palpitations. Ive tried a lot.. exercised distracted myself but that fear never left me. And now I am at my worst. I feel lightheaded in the middle of nowhere I have palpitations disorientation depression and I keep crying. I have loss of appetite gastric trouble chest pains and what not! And recently I just checked my blood pressure it came out to be 14080 with a racing heart. This has been killing me since the past week. Im so scared now that I have hypertension and its going to affect my health. because when I googled hypertension it showed lightheadedness as a symptomI also have another fear.. I cant get any tests done. Im really scared of getting them done bc I feel like theyll be something wrong and life can never get better. I havent been to a psychiatrist yet.. because many people have told me that the drugs dont help and that they cause other side effects which arent good for your body. I need help... should I get tests done or go to a psychiatrist??,Anxiety
34452,Sudden severe head and neck pain...should I worry? I was laying in bed when I felt a really weird painful feeling in my neck. It was almost like a stretching feeling.

Im really worried that I tore an artery or something. ,Anxiety
34453,So I'm in diagnostic phase to see if I have breast cancer and my doctors won't tell me anything. Okay so backstory. Four 4 weeks ago I found a lump under my armpit. It was hard fixed in place and didn't hurt. I watched to see if it would go away and it didn't. So I made an appointment with my GP.When he examined it he found that it was coming off of breast tissue of my right breast and ordered a mammogram and ultrasound which I had Wednesday.They found three lumps in my breast not including what is under my arm as well as my lymph nodes being enlarged. The only reason I know this is because I saw this on the ultrasound and asked the sonographer sp?.She showed the doctor my results and they recommended a CT Scan with Contrast and are sending me to a specialist.I've called to try and get my results from the mammogramultra sound but they won't give them to me over the phone which I understand.I had the CT Scan today and see the specialist Tuesday.I'm wondering if this was the process those of you with breast cancer or any cancer really went through test wise or do I have nothing to worry about?,Anxiety
34454,Lifelong HypochondriacHealth Anxiety. I didn't even know this Reddit existed until someone told me today after I posted in rxxketo about my platelet count. I am 33 years old and started with the HA when I was 16. I went to the doctor yesterday after troubling symptoms for a few weeks. I had a baby 3 months ago and gained 50 pounds so I have attributed my symptoms to weird hormones and my dieting but my health anxiety has come back full swing and now I'm obsessing about cancer of the lungs ovaries lymphomaleukemia and stomach etc..I also obsess about my heart rate lymph nodes I constantly check my fingers for capillary refill check pulse temp blood pressure and pupils. I have also obsessed about blood clots in the legslungs since this all started in 2001. I get blurry vision and dizzinessvertigo often along with a burning stomach throat and esophagus constant post nasal drip and tingling in my handsarms and legsfeet. Hotcold flashes weirdish night sweat hardly any sweating really and I have had severe joint pain and swollen red joints since 2015. It's intermittent and comes and goes. They have done RA bloodwork and gotten nothing even though my grandmother had RA and my aunt has lupus. Today I got my lab work and literally everything was amazingly perfect except my platelets which were 384 it said the range is 150379 and my T3 uptake for my thyroid was low..by 2 points. My doctor hasn't said anything yet I have an appointment again next week to discuss the results. Every part of me is so stiff and hurts so bad. My joints sear with pain and aching and my muscles are in total knots. I always feel nervous and anxious I feel nauseated and not even prilosec helps. It hurts to move sometimes. My bloodwork is always pretty much normalish this is the first time I've gotten something even remotely off. I'm always scared I'm going to die. I feel so vulnerable like I'll break if I push myself or do anything. I have tried CBD oil kratom cannabis and then also prescription drugs like Zoloft CelexaLexapro Ativan only thing that ever helped me. This is the worst condition to suffer from and I wouldn't wish this kind of torment on my worst enemy. I hate this shit. I know ya'll do too. ,Anxiety
34455,First time poster never used to be like this! Hi allAbout two years ago I passed out in my bedroom after riding home from work by bike on a cold day. Immediately jumped into a hot shower. Felt dizzy confused and then boom hit the ground. Was kind of half aware half unaware but then had a killer headache after a bit and slept it off. Went to the ER the next day for a CT Scan. Everything was peachy. Went about my regular day for a good 4 months until I was playing league and all of a sudden the cursor disappeared whenever it went past my right eye. I could still see out of it but I couldn't follow the cursor. Then the text became hard to read. Then I tried texting my mom that I was having a stroke but it came out like gibbrish. Then slow creeping numbness up my left arm all the way to my face. Somehow managed to call 911 and they brought me in by ambulance. Diagnosed migraines. MRI was clean. All that happened two years ago. I regularly get these strokelevel migraines with aphasia and confusion about once a month. Every sinus infection is a brain infection every unsymmetrical feature on my skull is a swollen lymph node and lymphoma. I'm itchy all the time in my apartment so I've got liver failure. Every minor ache or pain is the worst possible disease. I can't help myself making doctor appointments because I don't believe I have migraines.My life has been ruined my personality completely changed. I don't even feel real I walk around with derealization daily. Who am I?WTF is going on and how do I begin to deal? I'm only 29 and by most accounts pretty healthy.,Anxiety
34456,emetophobia I'm so tired of thinking about the stomach bug constantly. I can't even have a normal life. Im so worried about every meal becoming the one I have to throw up later. I worry my kids are gonna wake up and be sick with the stomach bug. It's a constant thought on my brain from the minute I wake up to the next time I wake up in the middle of the night. The only relief I get is when I have a wake up in the middle of the night and feel somewhat normal and then the sense of dread comes to my brain like...maybe this is my last hour feeling normal and I'm gonna start vomiting soon. ,Anxiety
34457,Awful feeling of dizziness and brain fog when standing? Just recently Ive been experiencing a lot of dizziness slight heartburn stomach aches and heat flashes. Heat flashes arent exceptionally uncommon for me. I also get a lot of stomachaches. Im not too worried about those. I have bad anxiety in general to begin with so when I started noticing around Tuesday or so I was getting this dizzying brain fog sort of thing I really began to freak out. Ive never experienced it before and Im worried its something serious. Im chalking it up to stress right now just had a family death general school stress being broke lack of sleep etc but Im really worried. It hasnt stopped. I feel like Im about to faint frequently. Its weird to describe but its almost like my brain is going a few steps too far ahead of my body. Sometimes vice verse. I stumble a lot when it happens and often need to hang on to something to steady myself.Ive noticed this is mostly happening when I stand. Its not as frequent or severe as when Im laying down which makes it really hard to get stuff done. I dont think its dehydration or a lack of sleep either. Ive been getting 10 hours of sleep in since it began and Ive been drinking as much water and Gatorade as possible.Has anyone else experienced this? Should I be calling a doctor?,Anxiety
34458,Has anyone else have had this type of anxiety attack? I have generalized anxiety but for the past couple of months due to the death of a loved one my health anxiety which was already present has skyrocketed. Anyway yesterday I started feeling anxious about something else than my health and then I had some coffee and started to feel sick like I was dizzy confused and nauseous. Health anxiety showed up again. While I was walking home I was constantly thinking I was going to die right there in the street and I started crying. I kept thinking I don't want to die in the street like this. At least let me get home before I die.. I got home and my relatives tried to comfort me but I couldn't calm down. I kept crying and feeling ill. I even vomited a little. Anyway they helped me test my temperature and blood pressure and blood sugar and they all looked fine but I was not feeling fine at all. Eventually I did calm down but it felt like forever. And I still feel physically bad so to say. I have aches and pains all over all the time. I feel like I'm 80 and I'm only 25.I don't get the normal raising heart beat thinking I'm having a heart attack kind of anxiety attacks so I'm not even sure if this is anxiety attack. Did any of you experience something similar?,Anxiety
34459,Dull Toothache. Should I go to ER or just wait it out. So on Wednesday I made a steak at home and got a string of fat stuck in between my back right two teeth. After eating when to floss and pick it out and digged around for a while. I think I got the piece out but my gums were bleeding a good amount. Note I do have healthy teeth and go to the dentist every year. On Saturday afternoon that tooth and jaw area had a dull pain made me stay in the night as it was just annoying. Today woke up and for the first hour seemed alright but that dull pain is now back. The thing is I am in the army and we are going to the field woods for training these next two weeks. So I won't be able to go see a dentist. Today is my last free day. Should I go the hospital since the dentist is closed today. Of course my hypochondria is freaking out because all these things of people dying from untreates tooth infections.,Anxiety
34460,I feel I'm becoming obsessed with the fear of being diabetic. Don't really know how to stop thinking about it. If this belongs more on rdiabetes I apologize and I'll remove if needed. TLDR Been scared of being diabetic since 2016 and got myself tested twice since last year. They found nothing but because of my anxiety I can't stop obsessing over it wondering if i really do have it and they just misdiagnosed me and I don't know what I can do to trust the word of the Doctor or stop obsessing over it all. Over the past year or so since 2016 I feel I've been fearful over being a diabetic. It's scary to me. Back in 2016 when I was having some frequent urination problems I went and looked it upBig mistake I know... and saw that they were possibly linked to things like diabetes anxiety prostate cancer I think I saw also..and diabetes was the one I started to worry the most about. So I looked into the other symptoms and started to piece together in my mind that I might have it. After some fighting with myself I went and got myself tested. Blood test showed nothing and I was able to relax and calm myself and it felt like the frequent urination problem I had stopped after hearing that.The problem came back though in last November. In December 2017 I got myself tested once again for it this time they gave me a urine test. Saying that they would do a blood test if the sugar in it was high enough. Which did worry me a little because it wasn't what I was used to seeing with diabetic tests but I did my best to trust it. They didn't need to do the blood test and said that things were okay.Then this year I felt i started to doubt it thinking I was being misdiagnosed that the test wasn't accurate enough and that I do have it they just haven't figured it out yet.I feel I'm gonna go back to my doctor's for a 3rd time to get tested because I'm waking up at night to urinate. But I don't know how to stop obsessing and panicking over this. It feels like every time something minimal goes wrong with my body. My mind is sent into overdrive thinking it's something truly awful going on with me. I was diagnosed with anxiety I know that much. So much that it feels like it does effect my day to day life a bit. I'm gonna try and get some therapy for it hopefully soon. ,Anxiety

34462,new here and need support HelloI am a sufferer of health anxiety and have been learning a lot about this disorder recently. I've always battled anxiety and depression but it hit an entirely new level when I was pregnant with my son who is now 4 and since his birth. Throughout his pregnancy I was convinced something was wrong with him. I was never relaxed or trusting despite having a textbook pregnancy with no issues. Since his birth I have been obsessed and I do mean OBSESSED with having breast cancer. I have had an absolute terror of cancer my whole life but it has reached a new level of hell in the past few years. I have to say and this is me venting here I am incredibly resentful of the overabundance of information on the internet about breast cancer because every time I google anything to do with my boobs it comes up as cancer. And it's because of this I have ended up in my lady doctor's office 4 times now showing her my breasts and the new dimple or vein or whatever that I have recently discovered. In my research on health anxiety I have learned that it falls more on the OCD spectrum than anything else which makes a lot of sense to me. My fear of breast cancer has become an obsession taking over my life at times and preventing me from enjoying anything. And the way I deal with it is compulsive by chronically checking myself over and over and over again in the mirror with my hands etc. I feel like I am discovering some new symptom every other day.Before anyone asks no I have not had a mammogram. I stopped breastfeeding my son 4 months ago and was advised to wait until at least 6 months. I have had my breasts looked at and examined and each time the doctor has said that things look and feel totally normal. They've also reminded me that by breastfeeding my son past 2 years I have reduced my lifetime risk for BC by 3040. I mostly know this is irrational and that my behavior mimics OCD. I am reading books on the subject and have schedule an appointment with a specialist who uses EMDR for trauma and anxiety. So hopefully those things will help. I have tried 4 different types of medications and none have worked because apparently I am one of the people for whom SSRIs don't work. Lucky me!Anyway I am rambling. I guess I am looking for support and stories. Can you relate? Have you found help? I am scared and sad and desperate.,Anxiety

I had a friend who passed away a few years ago while running due to an undiagnosed heart defect that he was born with.

34466,Been having bad stomach cramps for a week now...? I've been having really bad cramps they feel like period cramps but they're slightly above my uterus area. When I get there cramps I go to the bathroom and either take a dump which hurts my stomach or nothing comes out so then I wait for the cramp to go away. I don't know what's going on. Also I felt a weird stab of pain in my butt for a few seconds but then it went away. I've been eating pretty healthy but haven't had much meat...maybe that's it? I don't know. What do you think?Happy Monday ,Anxiety
34467,Breast Cancer Worries Hi everyone I'm sure this is nothing new but I really needed to get it out.My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer a few months ago and is currently going through chemo. I've had bad health anxiety all my life and my mom's diagnosis has pretty much put me over the edge.My left breast same as the one she found her cancer in felt sore so of course I squeezed and kneaded the hell out of it trying to feel something. I didn't feel anything other than the fact that it is slightly bigger than the other which is something I've known for a while but now I'm second guessing myself. The soreness went away with my last period and then returned this month. Again I squeezed and checked it compulsively. I cannot keep my hands off it. Always checking to see if it feels better or worse. My SO gently suggested that this isn't helping but I can't seem to stop. Now that my period has arrived it feels much better but there's still one spot that hurts to poke. I've also lost 70lbs in the past couple years so my breasts don't look great for a 26 year old and I think that contributes to my worry. I'm always looking for symmetry to assuage my fears.And now I've developed a rash that I'm pretty sure is from stress. It started on my stomach and is spreading. This prompted me to look up inflammatory breast cancer and I've basically given myself a death sentence. I'm going to the clinic tomorrow to have it checked out but every fibre of my being wants to cancel and just hope it goes away. I'm also going to request a referral for an ultrasound. I'm sorry if this is all over the place. I usually talk to my parents about my fears but obviously I don't want to bring this up. Besides the anxiety it's causing I also feel so horrible and selfish. Has anyone else imagined or basically given themselves symptoms after a family member or friend has been diagnosed with an illness? Any suggestions on how to function normally? I'm exhausted from the constant adrenaline rushes Thank you,Anxiety
34468,Uncontrollable HIV anxiety New to Reddit so I apologise if this post is a little all over the place!So I've struggled FOREVER with anxiety. I'm a 22 year old girl whole jaddajadda about troubled childhood absent parents etc which I think has contributed to it. Over the past 3 weeks I have been utterly destroyed with anxiety that I have HIV. I've been diagnosed with OCD and depression in the past as well as always having intrusive thoughts and being convinced that I'm on deaths door after panickingly Googling symptoms.So basically I met a lovely guy we really hit it off going on lovely dates every day for about a week. Then VERY out of character for me we got drunk and slept together every kind of sex for those interested. I barely remember it and the next day I knew we hadn't used anything because we couldn't even remember how we got home let alone anything else. Cue a panic just as we went out for breakfast the following day and I asked if he 'had anything'. He said no and seemed pretty offended. Well if he was offended by that he was even more offended when I said I thought he had HIV and proceeded to pester him all morning about when was your last test? Where do you have them done? How many people have you slept with? I physically couldn't eat for days and I spent the next 2 days having to make myself sick because the anxiety was making me so nauseous. I was shaking constantly waking up in the night in a hot sweat. In the end I spent 5 hours waiting in AampE until 1am to get PEP. I had to exaggerate to get it the guys parent's are Ghanaian and Nigerian he was born in Cuba but I said he was Ghanaian because I know there's a high rate there. I remember the doctor saying to me okay so there is some risk and I just started crying. I was exhausted and malnourished and felt utterly convinced at that point.The guy in question has been so lovely. He knew how anxious I was and he picked me up the following day at 7am to go to the local clinic to prove he didn't have anything. I'm currently taking PEP. All my friends think it's hilarious how anxious I am but honestly this anxiety is killing me. I can zone out for a good 10 minutes straight thinking about it. I'll think things like what if I've actually got it from a previous partner? This guy has tattoos would they test for HIV before that? What if he's taking me on all these lovely dates because he does have it and wants me to fall for him before I find out the truth? I had a blood test done at the end of January which was clear and my blood test from AampE was fine and I tested negative for everything except a water infection. Even then I was thinking what if the water infection is the start? I sneeze and convince myself these are the flulike symptoms. I see a spot on my body and I'm convinced that is the rash starting. Does anyone else suffer with this? I'm scared that even if I get a negative result that my anxiety will continue. ,Anxiety
34469,Hantavirus Hi all. I have OCD hypochondria panic disorder Cyclothymia blah blah blah the whole nine yards. Health anxiety fucks me up like daily but this week it's been super bad. So my fiance and I found a mouse in our room and kept it in a box for a bit because we had just had a bad snowstorm and don't want to put it out there and have it freeze. We've been packing because we're about to move and so we've been kicking stuff up but haven't found any droppings. Of course after we caught the mouse there were droppings in the box. Anyway now about a week and a half later I have heavy chest pressure a dry cough and back pain in the area of pleurisy. I went to medemerge last night and my blood pressure was 9865 pretty low but the doctor kept saying how great it was. I was diagnosed with a upper respiratory infection but she also gave me an antibiotic because my tonsils were pretty big. Well this morning I wake up and as I'm brushing my teeth I hack up something black. What the hell?!? I'm freaking out! I live in NJ but don't know the Hantavirus facts about NJ.,Anxiety
34470,Back pain and worst anxiety day in years!! Crying and scared 33 female. I have been doing really well with health anxiety not googling going to therapy etc. NOT TODAY! i am terrified I have some sort of kidney disease or something. Last night when I went to bed at 1 am i was irritated with back pain sort of mid back no matter how i moved so I changed my pillow my old one was giving me neck pain and headaches and still no relief. I didn't sleep well. I have been unable to function all morning so far bc I can't stop googling kidney failure infections back pain etc. I have sort of all over back pain mid back lower back not sharp but achey and like i pulled something. I can really feel it when i take a deep breath or move. Sitting on my couch right now even hurts. I finally broke down and took ibuprofen. I also keep excessively checking my urine to see if its cloudy and keep moving and touching my back and checking for other kidney symptoms. On sunday i spend several hours sitting on the floor going through several closets of clothing reaching and moving differently than normal. Yesterday I carried a heavy gaming system by myself from the floor to my car to the post office I also used my lap top while sitting on my couch to work most of the day and evening....Is it possible this is from weird posture and will go away or should I be going to the ER???? I know my anxiety is probably making it worse and my husband and parents are giving me the silent treatment now because I've had a slip in my anxiety. I am just really really really scared.,Anxiety
34471,Those of you that Beat Cardiophobia I Could use your Help... HelloLittle bit of background. My younger brother has a weird heart issue. He needed a pacemakerICD at 21. Nobody else in my family has it I've looked into it. I spent a whole summer getting second and third opinions from specialists in the field. I had 24 hr holter over the summer excercise test and several EKGs. This kicked off my intense fear.During the late fall I started developing weird dizziness. I went to the ER twice back to the cardiologist everyone deemed it panic. I want to believe them. I'm trying.The worst thing I've been doing is regularly checking my pulse and it's always changing. The doctors don't seem to worried though. When I'm relaxed or even just sitting and anxious it can be 60. Sometimes it's 107. The more I focus on it the more it fluctuates. I tried deleting the Samsung health app with the pulse ox but the curiosity always gets the better of me. I felt tired and panicky at work I had a little coffee and was surprised that my pulse was 66. Usually it's high when I'm stressed and have caffeine. I made a doctor's appointment and by the time I got there my pulse was 100. I showed him on the app that in the 5 minutes waiting for him to come in after the nurse took my vitals my pulse was all over the place. 65 84 100 76... He said that was normal.I just want to be free of this. I want to stop checking and freaking out. If it's high I get scared if it's low I get scared. The holter monitor averaged my hr at 66. When I'm take it it seems more like the 70s. I'm seeing a therapist but the hardest part for me it's believing I'm ok and stopping the hypervigilance and checking my pulse all the time.,Anxiety

34473,Tired of wasting my money and time I know nothing is wrong with me but I'm in so much pain all the time that I go to the doctor and my blood results are always normal. I'm so tired of it. I've wasted so much money going to the ER because the triage nurse suggested it based on my symptoms or because I was hunched over in pain for hours. I don't know if I'm a hypochondriac or what but I'm always at the doctors office and my job is very much at risk. At this point I'm saying fuck it if my appendix bursts then let it. If my iud punctures my uterus or becomes embedded in the uterine lining and causes digestive infection then let it. It would be better than living in pain just to be told nothing is wrong with me. Better than to be known as the unreliable employee. ,Anxiety
34474,Today I declined doctor's appointment. I had a dizziness episode and went to an ER. They did ECG brain scan bloodwork and did not find anything. My doctor's office called after couple of days I guess ER sends them medical records and asked if I wanted to schedule a followup. I'm not the one who would say no to seeing a doctor but I declined. Next time I hope I don't even need to to go to ER,Anxiety
34475,Ridiculously anxious about my teeth its making me miserable. Hi everyone. This is my first post here. Ive had health anxiety for around 3 years now but have only just joined reddit and thought Id search to see if such a subreddit exists and it does. So yeah Ive had HA for 3 years. It was severely bad 3 years ago I had a lot of stress going on but I managed to get it under control. I used to be so bad any pain or symptom I panicked and I cant even count the amount of times I called 999 or 111 Im in the UK and had ambulances come out for me. I was at the doctors almost 3 times a week. Everything has been fine until recently under a lot of stress again. A lot of uncertainty in my life and may have to uproot and leave my home for like the 15th time in the past 3 years. Ever since the stress the HA has crept back in. Right now Im petrified and convinced that Im going to lose my two front teeth. I havent been to see a dentist in the last 5 years since they gave me 2 fillings and I had such excruciating pain afterwards for a few months whenever I drank or ate something too hot or cold I had awful pain up the side of my face. Something as simple as changing my tooth paste fixed it and I havent had it since. But I havent been in 5 years and I think that itself is what scares me. Im not even registered at a dentist Im going to call round tomorrow morning to register. My problem is I am convinced that my 2 front teeth wobble. Well not wobble but they definitely move if I hold onto the tooth with my thumb and index finger and try to move each tooth. I can ever see it in the mirror I think. Its only slight and its not wobbling or twisting or anything like that. But thats enough to have convinced me that Im doomed and my teeth will fall out. I smoke so I think thats contributing to the fear. Plus I suffer from depression so I havent brushed as often as I should because I neglect myself. Has anyone else had any similar issues in relation to anxiety about their teeth? Are teeth supposed to move if you try to move them with your fingers? I did a google search awful I know I promised myself I would stop doing this and all the results were about gum disease or forums where people put as the header I lost my front teeth! So thats terrified me even more. My gums seem fine they dont hurt they arent red. They bleed when I brush sometimes but thats when im really rough at brushing. If Im gentle and brush properly no blood. Im so terrified Im already acting like theyve fallen out. Ive even been thinking that I wish they would just fall out at least then I could be like okay so now I need to get this sorted. But the whole worrying that it might happen is a nightmare. Ive been spending the past week either crying uncontrollably or sleeping so I dont have to think about it. That is of course unless I have a dream where my teeth fall out which I dream about quite frequently. Sorry that this is so long. Ive never really spoken about my HA before. Nobody ever seemed to get it and my doctor is in no way supportive or understanding just acts like Im annoying them. My family dont get it either. My mum actually told me I was deranged when I was in the middle of an intense panic attack a few years back. Thank you all for reading. I hope that everyone is well. Any responses will be greatly appreciated. ,Anxiety

A few months ago I had an ulcer in my throat left tonsil which freaked me out enough at that time but eventually it went away . Now ever since then my left tonsil seems to be swollen and has stayed this way but with no sensation. Few days ago got another tonsillitis infection what to do about this ! I went to the doctor and he brushes it off as nothing and prescribed me an antibiotic. If it helps to know Im also a smoker huge idiot I know Im really trying to quit . ,Anxiety

34478,Slightly red raised spot on the head of my penis For about a month now Ive had a small red slightly raised spot on the head of my penis. It hasnt changed in size or color. It doesnt hurt burn itch or anything. Its more of a aesthetic displeasure than anything else. I have had unprotected sex but only with my girlfriend of four years. I havent been tested for anything yet. I also had shown my dermatologist and they didnt say much just prescribed me a steroid cream. Any thoughts or any one else? ,Anxiety
34479,Have I been having heart attacks?! As of late Ive been experiencing pains on the inside of my left arm and frequent sharp pain in my chest to the left of my breast plate. Sometimes the pain radiates across my chest and shoulder and other times it can be one or the other. Ive also been experiencing rapid heart rates from little physical activity and high blood pressure. I do have pretty severe health anxiety and also suffer from digestive problems as well so I can be sure if it is just my anxiety manifesting physical symptoms. I went to the ER last week and they said the blood tests showed no signs of it being heart related but my PCP decided to have me wear a heart monitor patch for a week and that made me more conscious of my palpitations and pains. Today is first day since Ive taken it off and sent it in. While I was eating lunch normal meal that shouldnt have triggered anything I experienced hot flashes across my body and then the pains started again. Has anyone experienced similar symptoms? Im a 24 male who is 6underweight and pretty malnourished right now from my stomach issues. ,Anxiety

34483,Telling the difference between anxiety and something else? Upper stomach throat So I've had these symptoms for more than a month now...getting close to 2 and I KNOW I'm freaking out about them. Earlier I felt like I couldn't breathe and something might be wrong with my heart and that got all checked out got normal blood tests everything was fine and I finally saw my primary care who said my anxiety seemed really bad. So I felt silly for getting over anxious and I have a therapy appointment and a meds appointment and everything to deal with my anxiety. So that's all set to be dealt with.That said everything started in my throatupper stomach and that hasn't really been checked besides me going ahhh and doctor's looking down my throat apparently it looked bad at first but now looks fine. I'm having discomfort and some mild pain in a very specific area right under my breast in the center...front and back...the pain mostly in the back and discomfort in the front. I burp every time I eat I never burped before at all and the discomfort is worse when I eat and sometimes relieved when I burp. I have mild nausea. I have mucus in my throat a white coating on my tongue. And this has been going on for the full 1 month . I'm just not sure...is this just anxiety should I try to ignore it until my therapy appt? Is it indigestion or gas or acid reflux or something mild like that the primary care guy suggested acid reflux but I'm been trying various remedies for all this type of stuff and nothing seems to help? Or should I ask to be checked? My doctor does have an electronic place where I can ask a question but I just feel silly since I KNOW my anxiety is bad and it might just be anxiety.I see discomfort in this area can be related to like an ulcer or a hernia so I guess that would be my anxiety but mainly I just hate feeling so uncomfortable and having trouble eating so if there's any possibility it's physical I'd like to get it fixed!Does anyone have any advice or similar experience?EDIT So here's what ended up helping my acute anxiety. 1 I stopped Googling. 2 I remembered that while I felt sure I had an ulcer I felt sure a few days ago that I had anemia thyroid problems heart problems and I DID get tested for those...and they were all fine so it's likely this would turn out fine too even though I FEEL so sure. 3 I distracted myself and tried to do something else. ,Anxiety
34484,Has anyone tried EMDR for health anxiety? Ive got the worse health anxietyanxiety to where I have many panic attacks and pain everyday. Ive tried CBT it did not work. Having a therapist tell me to go to my happy place sounded like a croc of shit lol. Ive convinced myself I have MS and that I have heart disease. Those two are the big ones. Any small ache or pain I think Im dying. I dont take meds because Ive heard really bad things. Ive taken one Xanax which actually didnt even help. So Im gonna try and new technique and wonder if anyone has ever tried it? I also get numbness mainly on left side of my body. Thanks guys! ,Anxiety
34485,Persistent pain in Fibrocystic breast Anyone have similar experiences? A couple months ago I got a checkup because my breasts have always felt lumpy. Doctor felt with her hands and said they felt like normal lumpy breasts. I got an ultrasound and was told I have fibrocystic breasts. Cool! I could finally relax.A month later I literally woke up one day and felt a pain in my right breast I hadn't felt before. I don't know if pain is what I should use since it doesn't hurt too bad but I can definately and specifically feel it and it's a sensation I don't feel anywhere else in my breast.Ever since it randomly started that day months later it is persistent and I still feel it in the same spot. I'll feel it twinge throughout the day. It hasn't been getting more painful but it is a specific sensation in the same spot although sometimes when I sleep it'll feel slightly painfulmore pronounced in the morning but then goes back to its normal sensation after I move around. It also hurts when I feelknead it with my hands but so do many other parts of my boobs.During my cycle my nipples will get sore a few days before my period and then feel normal again once it starts that is the way my breasts have acted during my cycle for years. This new specific sensation in my breast is persistant throughout the month and I believe it's unrelated to my cycle.Has anyone had similar experiences like this? Any advice similar experiences or concerns if something's going on with me that I should get checked out would be appreciated. I'm so mad this pain decided to start RIGHT after I finally got an ultrasound so I feel obtuse about going to get it checked out again especially considering I don't know what else could be done to examine it besides getting another ultrasound. ,Anxiety
34486,Worried I have worms in my brains among other bizarre health anxieties. For the past several months I've been on a huge parasite scare that came out of seemingly nowhere. I even had stool samples taken again several months ago and everything came back negative. But now I'm thinking maybe the samples weren't great. Apparently they do their testing kind of hastily sometimes so I'm thinking of doing a second batch of samples.Anyway... I always thought that tapeworms were just an intestinal parasite. But then I read that they can spread to other organs too including your EYES and BRAINS. Christ. So naturally I look in the mirror every day to make sure there aren't any worms in my eyes. I also check my stool with every bowel movement. And now I'm worried that the larvae of this hypothetical worm has spread to my lungs I've been coughing a lot lately and brains as well would explain my headaches and why I feel so spaced out.I've also had to take my cat to the vet a couple times because she was diagnosed with diabetes so naturally I'm worried about fleas as well now. I just saw some kind of small brown bug on my floor one of my cats spotted it that bounced around a couple times before I killed it. Now it could've just been a moth that was struggling to fly but it could've also been a flea. Right? And infected fleas carry feline tapeworms that are even worse than regular tapeworms if they spread to humans.So yeah it's 3 AM and I'm going over all of this shit in my head unable to sleep.I guess I should mention I'm also worried about going blind as my astigmatism has been getting worse and I found out about something called keratoconus which I may have and I also have all kinds of pains in my body around pancreas and liver especially so I could also have cancer. Or maybe those are just the cysts formed by the larvae of the tapeworm.And I do also worry about earlyonset dementia and stuff like that but that's kind of taken a backseat while 90 of my mental energy goes into worrying about worms.,Anxiety
34487,Drove downwind of a confirmed asbestos fire today. freaking the hell out so yeah there was a major fire in the city today. we had no idea till we were driving up on it. The route I wanted to take was blocked due to the fire. At that time we had no idea the smoke was highly toxic. So cause our route was blocked I took a street pretty much parellel to the one we were supposed to take. We drive and we come across smoke and drive right through it. I also played the funny guy and breathed in really hard and said mmmm smell that to be funny.Read on the news when we got home the building contained asbestos and theres an asbestos warning for the whole city center. So yeah now here we are. I'm in a really really bad place now.That said there are a few things which I guess are kinda making me feel a bit better. We were about 800 feet maybe from the burning building in question and we drove through about 8 hours after the fire started and apparently it had been contained by that point.Still we walked around the city center all day and drove through it and waited at a stop light in the smoke. My lungs feel full and I think my nose burns a little though that could be becuase later on at the bar I stood with my frie ds a few times while they all smoked cigarettes.And this is kinda gross but I could have sworn my farts had a kind of asphalt like smell which I got when I quit smoking which indicates smoke inhalation of some kind. I guess I could be misidentiying it though.I dunno... I'm just really scared now.,Anxiety
34488,Health Anxiety gets worse during the winter months? Nice to meet you I'm new here.I've been struggling with HA for quite some years now. This last year I've graduated university and started a new career. Everything's been very stressful and somehow it's impacted my HA too.The thing I noticed is that it always gets worse and more intense during the winter months and beginning of spring. I get back pains my joints start to ache I feel tired... which triggers unhealthy and irrational thoughts and anxiety about my health for the last month I was absolutely sure I had heart problems lung cancer an aneurysm and some other illnesses. It's absolutely crazy.I don't know but it's often this way. It always gets worse during the period of january april. During summer and fall I sometimes get little health scares but they're nowhere as intense as during the cold and darker months.Do any of you have the same feeling?English is not my mother tongue so I apologize for possible mistakes weird phrases,Anxiety
34489,Worried about tetanus??? I was sorting through a ton of change some really rusty and old I had and my arm felt itchy so I scratched it pretty hard and it broke 58 little pieces of my skin.

Could I possibly have tetanus?,Anxiety
34490,Does anyone else only worry about sudden health issues? I dont know how to explain it really but the only health anxiety I have is usually kind of sudden things that could kill me like aneurysms embolisms all that. Ive never worried about cancers really or longterm sort of degenerative things. I almost think its because its the fear of not knowing something is coming. Im afraid the XRay missed something and that my aorta is going burst or something. Like if I knew something was coming I would be able to tie up loose ends spend time with friends and family take a vacation and live until I die. I wouldnt be happy about it obviously but I never get very anxious about things like that. The things that scare me are things that could just randomly kill me while Im studying or playing video games or something. The kinds of things that just make you drop dead and end up in an article like Healthy 20 yearold dies in sleep. Its more of a fear of sudden death for me like its waiting around the corner and I just dont see it yet. ,Anxiety
34491,Having a difficult time managing my anxiety Hi everyone. This will probably be quite lengthy so Ill apologize in advance. Ive been struggling for years with health related anxiety which I managed for a long time on my own. By manage what I really mean is just deal and push through it. Im at a point where its more than I can handle now and its crippling. My mother has had Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis for 21 years and I grew up watching her deteriorate from an independent strong woman into someone who is now dependent on someone else for even the most basic tasks. I think this is the root of my health anxiety. I am terrified of getting MS. Over the last 45 years Ive had varying degrees of symptoms ranging from tingling in hands and feet to constant headaches. Ive had a number of tests done which all come back either normal or with some other explanation. The most recent being a constant left sided headache and pain in my left eye. My primary care physician ordered an MRI based on my family history of MS which came back abnormal with some extremely small white spots which they were unable to make a diagnosis of. Their recommendation was to see a neurologist and get a lumbar puncture. This was in November...I live in Massachusetts which makes me extremely fortunate to have access to some of the best hospitals in the country. I was able to schedule an appointment with a neuro at Mass General currently 3 in the country for neurology. The doctor was extremely nice and listened to everything I had to say. He flat out said I do not think you have MS. He explained to me that MS has certain patterns that show in an MRI which mine did not show. He said he believes my headaches are being caused by a combination of tension from clenching my jaw at night which I absolutely do and migraines with aura which has happened twice. I asked about the lumbar puncture and he told me if I really wanted one and if it would put my mind at ease he would gladly order one but he felt it would come back negative. I certainly do not want to put myself through that unnecessarily and Im afraid it still wouldnt placate me. He also completed a full neurological exam which I passed. I left there feeling pretty relieved. That lasted for about an hour. I started thinking about what if hes wrong?? Hes basically just assuming this is due to headaches but he really doesnt know for sure. I really dont know what to do at this point. My anxiety is out of control and I cant stop thinking about this. It consumes every thought of my day and it is exhausting. I hate feeling like this. I do have a NP Psych who I see every six months who is very nice and tries to prescribe medication for me but I can never bring myself to take it. I read the side effects and they scare the crap out of me so much that Im too scared to take them. The only thing I will take is Xanax which usually isnt often but lately its been almost every day. I also see a therapist who also is very nice but if Im being honest isnt very helpful. Whether that is my own fault I dont know. I originally went to her because I have issues with control and wanted to try to work on that. I just dont find it to be doing anything for me though... I just wish I knew how to RELAX my thoughts and stop being such a worry wart. Im wound so tight Im ready to snap at any given minute. I get up every day shower go to work and then come home and lay in bed until I fall asleep because Im so exhausted. I dont know if Im exhausted because of my mental health work hours or if something is really physically wrong with me. Im honestly not even sure what Im looking for in writing this maybe I just needed to vent. But if anyone can relate or offer any advice I would be open to hearing anything you have to say. Life is so hard...,Anxiety

34493,Severe HA and a nodule found in my lung yesterday Hey all! I've been on Reddit for a while but haven't posted here. Basic backstory... I'm 34 female son died in 2009 was diagnosed with PTSD and general anxiety. Health in real life began to fail after his death. I have since been diagnosed with POTS fibromyalgia PAC's diabetes had two colonoscopies with polyp removal gall bladder removed three ruptured discs in my neck and recently had pneumonia at the beginning of February. The pneumonia brought back severe symptoms of HA. They hadn't gone away completely but I had made real progress. Yesterday I finally went to the doctor after three days of chest pain thinking maybe the pneumonia was recurring. After the xray I was told I was negative for pneumonia but I have a 1cm nodule in my right lung. She said they are usually benign but of course I'm flipping my shit. I have smoked for 22 of my 34 years on this planet so lung cancer is a real legitimate fear. I have to wait for two months for reexamination to check for growth. How the hell do I get through the next two months? I have found myself already writing an end of life journal for my other two kids. I feel completely defeated and hopeless. I'm not functioning. My house is a wreck and I just can't find any motivation to do anything at all. Please give me some advice to help get through the waiting game. Sorry so long but I'm feeling desperate. ,Anxiety
34494,Brain amoeba First of all thanks to everyone who participates here. Finding this sub has been a huge encouragement to me as I've realized I deal with increasingly frequent health anxiety. My current concern is with the brain eating amoeba. I spent time in a hot tub that wasn't properly chlorinated this weekend. Shortly after the hot tub I got in the shower and ummm.. picked my nose rather vigorously. After doing so I thought about the warm hot tub water so I blew my nose then used saline spray to clean out my nostrils. 2 times in the last 3 days I've gotten really dizzy and lightheaded feeling like I was going to fall or pass out. Today I've had a bad headache and have felt extra sensitive to light. No fever at this point. Allow me to think out loud can the amoeba even enter the brain from picking your nose? is it possible that the amoeba would have just been in my nostril then I helped it further up towards the brain with the stream of saline solution? would a headache associated with the amoeba come and go or be constantprogressively worse?I know a much more effecting outlet would have been distracting myself or using other anxiety relieving techniques.. but I couldn't resist venting on here. I'm struggling! I know the questions I posed are mostly unanswerable. Just needed to ask them out loud rather than let them cycle internally. ,Anxiety
34495,Years of Random Sudden amp Violent Vomiting. Anyone Else Have Similar Experiences? I am wondering if anyone else has had similar symptoms and had any luck correcting it? I am 39 and have been suffering from random vomiting spells in the mornings for approximately 15 years. I have seen many doctors and specialists without any luck finding a cause. They have performed many tests and everything showed up negative or inconclusive.It can come in waves but is fairly consistent. For the last two weeks I have thrown up 6 out of the 14 days 43 of the time. Sometimes itll be for a few days in a row sometimes I can go a month without a spell and have experienced it multiple times daily for over a month at a time. The worst was about three times daily for a month and caused me to lose 45 lbs that month due to no appetite.The majority of the time it happens in the mornings right after I wake up and before I get into the shower. It can happen throughout the day as well at random. Its fast uncontrollable violent and usually produced a white foamy substance. However I had my gallbladder removed in November due to gallstones. That didnt fix the problem and the docs thought it would. Ever sense the gallbladder removal all I throw up is yellow stomach bile. Today it went from yellow to a green color. After getting sick I usually have a pain of about a 4 out of 10 right in the middle of my torso. I find myself applying pressure with my hand to relieve the pain. Usually have to lay in the fetal position after a bad spell without an appetite until the end of the day or night. Some of the exams that have been done without luck is Celiac Disease the breath test for H. Pylori Barium Swallow test upper Endoscopy Colonoscopy ultrasounds of my gallbladder amp liver gallbladder removal MRI brain scan for tumors.Again it happens usually in the mornings with gagging and dry heaving until something comes up. Usually there is no food or liquids other than the white foam and stomach bile. If anyone else has experienced similar symptoms and found relief please let me know.Thanks!,Anxiety
34496,Same illness for two years in a row! Need advice Could be TMI but here it goesSo this started in March 2016. I started noticing that just before I peed I felt a sting every time before I passed urine. This when on for 23 weeks then I got really scared and when to the doctor. They prescribed a urine test and also prescribed some medicines for UTI. The results came back negative for a UTI. A couple of days later I had a really upset stomach with nausea and my roommate had to take me to the hospital. And I mentioned to the doctor about my prior visit. He prescribed another urine test checked my penis for any issues I also felt some tightness in my foreskin. He couldn't find any issues. And this urine test came back negative too. I was starting to panic as I the situation was not getting better. So I had to fly back home to see another doctor i was in college btw. Another doctor another urine test and the result nothing nada zilch!It was same for some more time and then I started feeling gassy along with the initial symptoms. I got prescribed some gas relief medicines and that was it. All in all this went for couple more months then the sting before peeing gradually went away.So now a little over a year later in June 2017. The same symptoms returned. And the same progression of symptoms occurred the stinging sensation and few weeks later the gassiness etc. But it was worse this time around I had a very bad heart attack scare with symptoms like pain in the chest my left arm going completely numb and gassiness. So I was rushed to the hospital where they performed an ECG. I had a fever too. They concluded that nothing was wrong with me. Oh yeah I had another urine test a couple of days earlier and it was negative. Amidst all this chaos I had to travel and it had a 32 hour travel time. So obviously I wasn't looking forward to it. And my nightmare came true. I finished that journey with constant gassiness nausea and uneasiness. So I guess I'm not in a hurry to ever take on that long a journey ever again in my life. So these symptoms finally improved but painstakingly slowly 4 months.So my concern now is that it gonna be April soon that means I might get this stupid mysterious illness again. What do I do? I feel about 70 just might be my head which is causing all of this anxiety.Also i feel I was misdiagnosed everytime. The doctors always brushed it off with Your results are fine don't worry about it.,Anxiety

34498,Waking up with a dead limb and worrying I had a ministroke I woke up to pee in the middle of the night and when I stood up my lower body was involuntarily leaning to the left. It seemed like my left leg or knee had just given out but I was still able to stand. After a couple minutes it went away and I was walking normally. I ended up going to the ER after speaking with a nurse. All blood tests came back normal and so did the physical tests. The doctor checked my eyes walking reflexes etc. It's the next day and I can't help but feel like they missed something and that I could have possibly had a TIA ministroke which can be a warning sign for a stroke. I even told them I was feeling lightheaded the day before but I don't know what is just anxiety now. Still feeling out of it and being hyperaware of my body right now.

34502,Trying to be a supportive girlfriend of hypochondriac boyfriend Hi all! My boyfriend and I have been dating for over two years now and I always sorta joked about how he was a hypochondriac but hes shared some recent concerns with me and Ive realized how severe his anxiety is behind it. A few weeks ago he was convinced he had ALS because of muscle twinges. Last night he shared with me that hes terrified he has liver disease as a result of how much he used to drink in college. He gets down this long rabbit hole of searching through the internet and it drives me crazy because its not helping anything. And he refuses to get tested for anything because he doesnt want it to be confirmed true. He has generalized anxiety on occasion and has started to go to a therapist but still hasnt talked about these types of things with the therapist which drives me crazy. Were in our midtwenties live in a metropolitan area and live a pretty healthy lifestyle going to the gym frequently and eating semihealthy. Im thinking about blocking sites like Mayo Clinic and webMD so he cant search at home but I dont know if thats a mean thing to do.Anyways can you please share advice on how I can be the most supportive I can be? Or any advice I can share with him?? Thank you!!PS this has been my very first post to reddit D ,Anxiety

34504,Struggling tonight I've always had issues with health anxiety and I can get really scared when I think even the slightest thing is wrong with me. I finally got to the doctor for my annual physical and that was a nice victory in itself. Unfortunately my blood work came back with low platelets and elevated liver enzymes. My doctor had me get retested and those numbers came back today and they're worse so now I'm going in for an ultrasound and more testing to rule out hepatitis. I can't stop shaking and crying. I'm so scared! It's probably going to be nothing but I can't stop thinking about all the serious things it could be. I'm taking care of it with my doctor but I really could just use 100000 hugs right now. And some chocolate. I just wish everything came back fine instead of having these things to worry about until I get it all confirmed that it's okay. Every time I even look at my dog I think he's looking at me like he knows I'm sick. My anxiety is just spiraling out of control.,Anxiety
34505,Hypochondriac seeking advice on visiting fiance in the hospital Hello there! I'm looking for advice on how to cope with a special situation. My fiance is admitted into the hospital ICU with the flu and pneumonia. I am flying out there to be with him but I am so scared of the hospital and getting sick. His entire family has the flu as well. I want to be with him and by his side but my anxiety is through the roof about it. I'm going to go because he needs my support but does anyone have any advice or coping skills to help me get through this? He might be there for multiple days and that thought is ruining me. I've always had bad experiences in hospitals like passing out so my anxiety correlates the hospital with passing out which is a big fear for me. I'm scared that something is going to happen to me while I'm there. I'm also scared of catching the flu myself. By the way I have panic disorder if you couldn't tell. I know I have to do this for him but I could really use some advice to help me survive. Thank you.,Anxiety
34506,Post TC anxiety Hi allJust venting some steam off here.So last August I found a lump I had a CT an op to remove my left testicle and then on 02 October was officially diagnosed with Stage 2a Testicular Cancer. Since then Ive had Chemo Radiotherapy and as of a few weeks ago my first Scans are normal meeting with the Onco. Hooray!That said the health anxiety Im experiencing is taking the piss. Every little ache twitch twinge anything makes me worry unnecessarily.As a result of the Radiotherapy my guts have been a bit iffy since but a recent toothache caused me to take a lot of Ibuprofen which together with the Radiotherapy caused me some really dire constipation. This lead to a hemorrhoid. Its internal and normally I cant feel it unless Ive sat on something cold in which case it throbs for a few minutes and then stops. Occasionally theres a spot or two of blood on my crap and one occasion I had such a large bowel movement that it turned the toilet water bright bright red but otherwise my bms are consistent size shape colour and bloodless they just scratch a little as they pass. Im improving my diet to include more fibre so hopefully itll sort itself out.Right now I want to concentrate on the future. Ive been given a new lease of life but I feel that all the residual after effects are holding me back and the worry over everything my body does is becoming quite a burden.,Anxiety
34507,Lets talk coping strategies I love this sub. Everyone has been super open and supportive. In my short time following i have felt a sense of belonging here because all of you seem to really understand how it feels to deal with HA. For me its an stressful frustrating terrifying condition that leaves me paralyzed with fear and exhausted from sleepless nights of searching the internet for reassurance. I definitely get the temptation to post here looking for reassurance from each other that our symptoms are benign but lets take some time to talk coping. I would love to know what you do to cope when the anxiety takes over. Perhaps we can help each other cope a bit instead of reassuring each other that we are healthy. Ive shared my two tips before the first is to allow myself a few moments a day to think about my worry. I give it space to exist without doing anything to correct it. I recognize that its there and then put it back on an imaginary shelf to visit again tomorrow. The rest of the day I do what I can to keep it there. Sometimes I even say no Ill talk to you later! Its worth noting that this strategy doesnt always work but sometimes days go by and my anxiety has been kept at a manageable level.The other one is for full on panic attacks I pick out 3 things I can hear smell see and if possible taste. Sometimes doing this mindful activity can give my brainbody the space to rest for a moment.... long enough to calm down a bit. Anything work for you? ,Anxiety

And I have a strong urge to pee as my groin feels really strange. I have pain in my left arm as well and I feel like my hearts about stop any moment. I have no history do any heart problems. I have had anxiety attacks in the past but they always scare me into thinking I'm having a heart attack or cardiac arrest. Is this just another anxiety attack?

34510,chest pain I'm only 16 and I have occasional tight chest pains on the left side. I've been to a cardiologist for other unrelated things because of an abnormal EKG but it was an abnormality that was no cause for concern. I am a pretty anxious person but sometimes these will come on randomly when i don't feel that worked up. I have gotten a chest Xray several 24 hour moniters stress test and blood tests. I don't know if its hormonal or what is going on but its pretty scary. The pain is sometimes a dull achey on the left side and sometimes pokey feelings on the opposite side. The pains come and go.. But sometimes i do notice my heart rate going super super fast when I'm stressed or when I get overwhelmed. But I just don't know the cause of these pains. Any advice on how to deal with these.,Anxiety
34511,Reassurance HelloI stumbled upon this subreddit about two weeks ago and since then have been reading it often to help cope with my health anxiety. I often end up laughing at myself over my anxiety. This is my first post and rather lengthy. I apologize. My most recent concern is that I have some sort of colon cancer. I have been having unusual bowel movements for several months. Changes in appearance size etc. Sorry too much information. I mentioned it to my doctor earlier this month and he shrugged it off and said to try Miralax. I did but didnt notice much difference aside from change in color and more loose. Ive recently thought Ive noticed some red streaking in the stool which has elevated my anxiety about the situation. My employment offers a telemedicine service so I called and spoke to a doctor about my concerns and he said its likely IBS and promised I was fine. I follow up with my doctor again this past week and he said the risk is slim for anything major but referred me to a gastro doctor. The appointment isnt until next month. This weekend I decided it would be a good idea to get an EZ Detect test which tests for blood in the stool. These are little pieces of paper you put in the toilet after a bowel movement that changes to blue or green if blood is detected. You are first supposed to put a paper in to test the water color. I decided to skip that step and test my first bowel movement yesterday late afternoonearly evening. There was no color change on the paper. I was satisfied. This morning I decide to do the water test to eliminate any what ifs from my mind. Once again there was no color change. I follow the water test with another bowel movement. There was no color change. There is a control test you are supposed to do at the end to verify that the paper worked properly. It comes with a powder that changes the color of the paper. I flush everything and pour the powder in and then place the paper in for the control test and it instantly turns blue. About an hour or two later I feel another bowel movement coming on and I decide to use my final test. The paper instantly turns a very faint blue and I immediately freak out. About 510 minutes later I realized that I had put the powder in the toilet and that its possible there was some left over in the water even after flushing. I have noticed some little white specks in that toilet throughout the day today. I just am looking for some reassurance that there was likely a little bit of left over powder and that my health anxiety is getting the best of me as usual.,Anxiety

34513,Sharp stabbing pain in head on top of head in the same spot every time can't stop thinking it's a tumor For the past 4 months or so I've been getting this offandon stabbing pain in the top of my head. It stabs for a second and then goes away and it keeps happening and it only seems to happen when I open my mouth or talk or smile. I had a big episode where I thought I was dying of an aneurysm and went to the doctor and all that and figured out that it was not the case so I've been through all that but I still can't help this nagging feeling of WTF IS IT THEN??Initially I theorized that it must be my headphones causing it headband is too tight because the pain seems to be coming from muscles on the outside of skull as shown by how when I massage it the pain temporarily suppresses. So I switched to inear buds exclusively and the pain went away for awhile. I thought I had won... but now it's back! AGH. Why? And now that I've ruled out headphones as the cause I am freaking out again. Constantly thinking it must be something fatal. Even though I have already shown myself that it is muscletension related massaging it the fact that it only happens when I open my mouth etc. and multiple doctors have assured me that what I am experiencing is not lifethreatening. I just can't stop I want the pain to leave me alone. ,Anxiety
34514,fear of rabies hi i'm new to this subreddit but i've been lurking it for a while so i figured i'd give this a shot instead of other forums. i've been a hypochondriac since i was little but it's been kind of getting worse with age. now something new and exciting has hit me super hard and super fast rabies!it comes and goes and my ocd a whole other animal makes it worse but right now it's at one of its peaks. long story short my HEALTHY VACCINATED dog scratched me and since then the spot on my wrist where it's at has had an internal tickling sensation and to make matters worse when i get nervous my throat gets tight and i feel like i can't swallow. i feel like i'm fully going crazy.i love all my dogs but due to all of this i can't even bear to be around them anymore. i just sit around and cry all day on the lookout for symptoms and trying to come down from all this anxiety and it's almost like i can't trust myself to know that i didn't contract anything. like 'i KNOW it's all in my head but HOW DO I REALLY KNOW?' or 'WHAT IF ITS REAL THIS TIME' or something.i'm starting to feel hopeless and like i'll never calm down again. i feel really dumb and embarrassed because i definitely know better but i just... like won't listen to my better judgement. my family and friends are sick of me being such a mess and that makes me feel bad too.sorry if this is long or ranty or hard to follow this has really gotten under my skin pun kind of intended. can anyone relate or offer some advice? if you've had the same problem what did you do? i'm kind of super at the end of the rope with this lmao,Anxiety

34516,Nervous wreck ulcerappendicitis Google brought me heregarding ironically as it is causing me to be a nervous wreck.Last month I got hit with bronchitis hard. Couldn't breathe chest was heavy fever hacking the whole works. Around that time my stomach would be hurting after exercise or drinking a lot of wine or taking ibuprofen but I didn't think much of it it always went away after awhile and was t that bad. After the antibiotics my chest was better but my throat was still swollen. I ended up getting a raw piece potato stuck in my throat didn't chew it well enough and had to get an endoscopy to push it down. Since then I've had some of the worst acid reflux from my esaughagus being swollen but nexium and tums seemed to help...until this morning. I drank a couple cups of coffee to my multivitamin and about and hour afterwards my stomach began hurting again. It felt like a knife stabbing me 1000 time in my upper abdomen. I planned on walking to the e.r. but I had to stop and rest at the police station where they seen me sweating pofusely breathing hard and pale and called an ambulance. I'm there for three hours. My white cell count came back fine as did my hemoglobin and everything else. She said before I left you may have an ulcer brewing down there but only your GI can go and look for sure. I was released with a antacid and zophran.Well like a dumbass I sat down and Google my symptoms of an ulcer. Started reading about puforated abdomen and began freaking out . I tried to smoke some green to calm down as it worked before and had some vague pain in my lower right side. Since I am my own biggest asshole I absentstoner mindly put lower right abdomen pain thinking it was gonna say ulcer and reinforce what I believe without solid proof....aaaand guess what it says first? Appendicitis. I still have my appendix not my galbladder and boy THAT was a dumb idea to google. I shut down my home screen and put in some gtaV and tried to veg out on that. It worked temporarly. I have to call my GI in the morning and I keep telling myself I'm probably just tripping out and blood tests dont lie but there's that though in the back of your head that keeps your heart racing. Mostly because I have never had appendicitis or an ulcer no does anyone I know have had besides my dad which I was 7 and remember my brother going when I was being a whiny as sexstarvedpeepingtom dad has an ulcer. If it start's bleeding because your stressing him out he can die. He did die cancer 6 years later. Google is an amazing tool but I think I should stay off it.

34518,Anxiety gt ... gt tender neck muscle To start I've been going through a lot of health anxiety the last few months. I've never actually felt sick or anything but this basically stems from getting fixated on swallowinghyperawareness for months on end. It started out as if it might be tmj pain but recently it was tongue pain mostly when swallowing for a few weeks. After I finally went to a dentist assuming I must be scraping it on sharp teeth or something they weren't able to find anything wrong. That has since eased off I assume because my anxiety about it relaxed but now it's more focused on a tender spot that seems to be on my scm muscle...which I saw can be a cause of swallowing pain.The upper front end just below the corner of my jaw spanning about a halfinch. It feels as if it's bruised or something and it seems to be super tender to the touch. I don't feel any strange lumpslymph nodes and my salivary gland above it feels fine it seems to be part of the muscle or a tendon in there. Pretty close to the surface. I've read that trigger points in the digastric might be involved causing pseudoscm pain but it's been driving me crazy. I've also been feeling a lot of tension around the upper shoulders. So I wanted to just see if this all sounds like a reasonable idea of what's happening and if anyone's got some advice. It's super irritating and it's really hard to take my mind off the tenderness. I'm going to try and get a massage next week I think. Any help would be much appreciated,Anxiety

I do brush and rinse regularly and smoked smoked socially but quit earlier this year.

However I've also been experiencing some mild chest pains and also this feeling of an obstruction when I breath in but I can still get a deep breath. Occasionally it might feel like I can't. Also it feels like there might be some chest tightness or pressure. Throughout the course of this cold I've been afraid of it turning into pneumonia so obviously this is making me pretty anxious.

Long story short I was recently accepted into a Nursing Program at a local college. Part of the admissions process involves a physical exam. I enlisted in the Army at 18 and had a physical at MEPS but the doctor was an old man so it didn't matter much. This time however the physical will be at a local clinic due to my lack of insurance. The doctor and the practitioners that work in his practice are all old family friends. Like since I was about 6 I'm extremely nervous because I'm afraid the physical will make things weird around these people.

34534,Fluttering Having an episode now and just need to vent. Open to advice or anything you have. A few months ago I started feeling a funny feeling in my chest. Specifically it seems to occur when I lay down after light exertion. Like walking up the stairs and plopping on the couch. My heart flutters like crazy. It will beat hard one time not beat for like two seconds and then beat really fast. I get this funny feeling in the back of my throat too. So I went to my PCP and she listened and said she heard a murmur AND a flutter. Great. So Im dying. Well she sends me to a cardiologist. I get an EKG and a halter monitor for 24 hours. Nothing shows. Cardio says its fine. Not a single thing to worry about. But I still get these things. It fucks with my head cuz I just keep thinking a healthy heart doesnt do this and I will probably die young because of this. I know these things are common but that serves little comfort when they are happening. I just worry that my heart is wearing out or something. Can anyone provide me with literature that goes into detail about how chronic palpitations are not associated with lower life expectancy? Or if they are hit me with that shit too. Im not afraid of the truth haha. I just get into this habit of checking my carotid pulse when it happens and being like ooohhh fuck youre surely gonna die this time... this is a bad one... ,Anxiety

34540,Terrified of brain amoeba fowleri Hi everyone. I'm down in South Australia and I've found myself going a little insane over something very silly for the last day....I will start by saying that our water has a decent amount of chlorine as far as I can tell it's the only thing you can taste in the water and if you fill a bathtub it's even ever so slightly green. There's never been an order to boil water or anything of the sort either here.So moving onto story time. I often get itchy eyes before bed so I keep a glass of water in the bathroom that way I can rinse my eyes out quickly to calm things down the glass of water had probably been out for a few hours anywhere from 6 12. Last night I did it and as the water ran down my face a little bit got in my nose maybe a drop or 2 tops. I started freaking a minute later as I remembered all I'd read about fowleri.... I blew my nose a bunch and I rolled up some toilet paper and stuck it up my nostril as well in an attempt to deal with any water that had made its way up there. I spent a terrified hour in bed reading things on my phone and eventually calmed down enough to sleep.Now all day today I haven't had a fever or anything of the sort but I have been getting sinus headaches. Quite possibly from blowing my nose so much And I got rather paranoid in the shower too anytime water got near my nose or even the tiniest bit might have entered I freaked out a bit. My right nostril which is the one the water entered is also worse than the left but the discomfort might just be from me freaking out and blowing it a ton... I have bad sinuses at the best of times so it could just be dust or allergies too.I know I'm probably being silly but some confirmation would be lovely especially since the glass of water while cold was sitting out a long time... A day of sinus headaches just doesn't exactly fill me with confidence even if it probably was cause I wouldn't leave things alone. One last thing to note is that 2 family members of mine recently had colds so that might be why I'm feeling crappy sinus wise too the right side being worse than the left still has me all freaked out though.,Anxiety
34541,A great simple technique for coping with health anxiety I posted this as a comment to another thread about panic attacks but thought it warranted its own post. It's adapted for anxiety from a similar method in Feeling Good The New Mood Therapy a book on depression by David D. Burns M.D.If you struggle with health anxiety or any kind of anxiety really give this a try the next time your worries start to get the better of you. I do it in an Excel spreadsheet but a notebook works fine too.The ThreeColumn TechniqueColumn 1 FearIn this column write down whatever's freaking you out at the moment I'm worried I'll have a heart attack out of nowhere or What if someone took what I said at yesterday's meeting the wrong way?Column 2 What triggered itWrite down what you were thinking feeling or doing when you started down your current worry spiral. For example I felt a skipped heartbeat or I felt my lymph nodes and they seemed a little swollen. Over time some triggers will appear more often in your notes than others helping you spot habits that get you into trouble.Column 3 Real talkNormally you only think of the worstcase scenario. This is your chance to do the opposite write down every reason you can think of that you'll be absolutely fine which by the way are exponentially more realistic scenarios. Go nuts the more you write the better you'll feel. For example my scariest symptoms are skipped heartbeats so when I feel one I list points like these Skipped heartbeats are perfectly normal most people have them and don't even notice Some people experience thousands of skipped beats a day and are perfectly healthy You already met with a cardiologist and she gave you a clean bill of health Skipped beats are a very common side effect of anxiety it's much more likely anxiety is the cause than some rare heart defect This aside I have zero symptoms of an underlying heart issue ...and on and on.The more you use this technique the more you'll notice the same fears and triggers popping up over and over again. And when you see that you'll see how often you worry about the same thing and how your worst fears are never ever realized.Hope this helps stay strong!,Anxiety
34542,Thought I was finally getting over my brain tumour worry... It's been over two years many illnesses MS Colon Cancer Diabetes you know the story but the one constant is this damn brain tumour. Antidepressants and CBT yet it's still there I even successfully stopped googling anything medical for nearly 2 months but relapsed very bad this week. It always comes back to brain tumour now I'm feeling like I haven't made any progress I can't get past it. Don't know how much longer I can do this.,Anxiety
34543,As someone who has recovered from health anxiety I want to reiterate how true the pinned post about reassurance is unathan98900 has posted some excellent advice about how reassurance feeds health anxiety. If you are not hypochondriac and you get stressed due to a chest pain then yes reassurance will work for you and you will get on with your life. But if you are hypochondriac since your mind is in worrymode when you are reassured about one of your symptoms yes you will feel temporary relief but it is very likely you will probably find something new to worry about. I was sick and tired of worrying about every single symptom and spending a fortune on dozens of doctors. So one day I decided that I will stop caring about my symptoms and stopped googling and got on with my life no matter what. Then for a few weeks my symptoms and anxiety become worse almost unbearable. Of course they would be. My anxious mind had got used to the instant gratification from reassuarance seeking and was begging for that. But I had said to myself that I would keep myself busy and distracted no matter how anxious I was and ignore my symptoms no matter how much panic I had. Then something very logical happened. My mind decided that since I am not reacting to all these symptoms then they must not be that serious. So it could take some time off and relax and not worry anymore. Then anxiety slowly dissipated and along with that all these symptoms that I thought could give me a diagnosis of 20 extra rare fatal diseases went away as well. Also remember that almost all people recover. You do not see that in this sub because people that recover do not come back to post. You may feel hopeless now but it is certain that you will be fine eventually once you find what works for you. This is what worked for me btwhttpswww.reddit.comrHealthAnxietycomments7z73gnigotridofhealthanxiety3yearsagoafterStay strong and take care!Edit Sorry for the unstructured post I wrote this on my mobile phone,Anxiety
34544,Worried ive had cancer and its progressed too far now undiagnosed I apologize in advance for my sloppy writing. Im a 19 year old male and 18 last year when i started experiencing my symptoms. It was June or july 2017 and i had been starting to feel tired more often as my senior year ended. Nothing shocking since ive always been tired and i was losing sleep over stress of not knowing where i was gonna go for college or how i was gonna spend the summer. One day in the summer when i was hanging out with my cousin i became unbareably tired and felt like i was gonna pass out. Id describe it just as the feeling of having really low blood sugar. I layed in my bed and freaked out because i thought i had something terribly wrong with me my parents didnt take it seriously but instead talked very gently through it with me about how it was probably my anxiety and that did bring me back to feeling somewhat less fatigued after a rational conversation. I thought this feeling would go away during that week for sure but i felt fatigued the whole week through. Being alone bored fatigued and scared to death that whole week took such a toll on my anxiety and stress levels. After that week i started to attempt to move past it getting out and doing more physical things to try to shake it off and to also test that my physicallity wasnt degrading. Im not very fit and was never good at running but i wasnt physically diminished at all i could run for just as long and do just as many pushups despite feeling a vague fatigue. After that it was on and off but it always came back a sensation if vague fatigue and low blood pressure that would just strike me randomly. I went to the doctor a month later and all of my vitals were normal and he brushed it off as anxiety and stress related. I also wanted a blood test which returned as completely normal. So i was just living like this being constantly fatigued on and off. I eventually went back to him in august to try and get more answers but with good vitals yet again he wouldnt listen to my concerns and kept telling me it was psychological. I had another blood test which came back completely normal. Probably around september i started focusing on my bowel habits and noticed sometimes my food was indigested. So i thought hey either colorectal cancer or ibs is behind this. I got a stool test done which came back completely normal. Now comes the beginning of this year and im still feeling frustrated by my off and on fatigue without any answers so i try talking to a new gastro doctor because im still focused on having colorectal cancer. This doctor actually listens to everything i say and he suggests adding fiber to my diet. He asks me if i wanted a colonoscopy but i say no because im afraid to have one and we have poor insurance which is possibly the most annoying aspect of this whole thing because whenever i visit the doctor which yields nothing my moms stuck with a bill that almost always goes into collections anyway i voice the concern that i might have celiacs disease because i have many food allergies as it is. I get a blood test done in late january checking for sprue and some cancer markers because i voiced my concern. Still completely normal and its not celiacs. Here we are in march and my worries at an all time high. Its literally all i can think about. Made so much more troubling by the fact that over the past week ive been off balance on and off. This started last week after smoking marijuana right after waking up and having an anxiety attack im scheduled to go to a different doctor for a physical and guidance but the next available spot is fucking april 29th. Im so afraid i have some kind of abdominal cancer and its already too far. ,Anxiety
34545,I feel drained mentally because of myself Every single day for the past few years I have woken up and felt something wrong with me and I convinced myself it was everything you could possibly imagine cancer AIDS heart disease and whatever else. I used to smoke cigarettes regularly I switched to Juul which is still unhealthy but at least it's better but I just recently quit due to my fear of developing cancer. Every tiny problem with my allergies constant dry cough dry throatmouth has a reasonable cause but I ignore it and continue to worry myself to death. My health anxiety is bringing me down and I'm constantly depressing myself to the point of not caring about anything. edit grammar,Anxiety
34546,UTI wont go away I was diagnosed with kidney infection last Tuesday but had to stop Bactrim early because of allergic reaction. I had my UTI right culture done and theres still bacteria in it. My Doctor said it could be because I had to stop early or it wasnt right med for that bacteria.So my doc is calling in another round of antibiotics. Im sad and anxious Ive heard stories about ppl who battle these and forever and some that escalate into something worse. Has anyone gone through similar with a positive outcome? Thanks!! ,Anxiety
34547,Some advice for those of you suffering from hypochondria.... Get professional help before it turns into a more generalized anxiety. Over the course of six years I basically burned myself out on the health anxiety. One disease after another until the point that I stopped caring about any symptoms imaginary or real altogether. Unfortunately it's turned into a living hell of generalized daily anxiety with no breaks in between. I thought I had beaten my health anxiety into submission but in reality it just morphed into a new beast. Now instead of having some relief between imaginary diseases I face an unrelentless onslaught of unreasonable fears. ,Anxiety
34548,Worried About Arsenic Poisoning I'm a college student volunteering at the local Natural History museum in the ornithology collection. Early on my supervisor warned me that some of the older specimens had been treated with Arsenic. I continued sorting specimens never running into the aforementioned older ones until last Tuesday. When I encountered them I made sure to handle them carefully and thoroughly washed my hands when I had finished with each bird. When I mentioned the specimens to my supervisor she jokingly said technically we should be using gloves. I immediately began to panic. For the last few days I've been concerned that my health has unecessarily been put in jeopardy. I read online that there can potentially be cross contamination between specimens so now I'm worried other birds could have had trace amounts. I haven't always been super diligent about washing my hands postvolunteering. Now I think I may have permanent brain damage. I forgot my headphones to an editing job today which only bolstered my concern. Does anyone know anything about Arsenic? I'm freaking out.,Anxiety
34549,Soreness in Hand and Leg Starting on monday night my left hand has been numb sore and weak. And then on wednesday my left leg had started to get sore. I'm worried that this could be ms or guille barre or something similar. Anyone else had an experience like this?,Anxiety
34551,Stressful anxietyridden past few months So I just wanted to start off by saying that this community has really helped me to calm down by knowing so many others are going through similar things as myself. Everyone is also so kind and helpful to one another which is even more reassuring.I've always had a little bit of health anxiety since I was a child e.g. thinking I have appendicitis when I have a pain in my right lower stomach but for the past several months I have been in constant panic mode. It all started when I went to the ENT in December she removed the wax from my ears which I've had done before and then a few days later I had intense ringing in my ears a clogged feeling in my right ear headaches and dizziness. I was googling like crazy which made things even worse. That ringing and googling led to what I now know were panic attacks in which I was feeling disconnected from the world and having episodes of shaking like the chills amongst other symptoms. Long story short and countless ENT visits later where they didn't find anything wrong with me I then went to the dentist who said I most likely had a TMJ disorder as a result of grinding my teeth which I thought would make me feel better. But obviously it didn't and I just started to get different symptoms instead. I have been having a random tic in my neck in which it will randomly slightly jerk my head. Sometimes I get a little spazz in my leg or my arm as well and a twitch that will last for a second or two in random body areas. I also have like a shaky feeling on the inside which will sometimes lead to my fingers or toes being a little trembly. I recently have been getting floaters in my eyes which I'm not sure if I've always had them and just never noticed or if it's something new my vision has been bad for years. Also I randomly have visual snow which I think I've also had for a while but was never really concerned about until now. I feel like I am so hyper focused on my body and I just don't know how to get out of this phase.I am only 23 and I feel like I am going crazy. I'm in my last year of grad school right now and currently doing an internship in a hospital for speech pathology. So not only am I at a super stressful time in my life but I am around these disorders such as ALS Parkinson's MS etc and the fact that I see these disorders frequently makes me even more nervous because they can really happen to anyone! I am caught between that 1st year medical school syndrome thing and going to the doctor to see if there is something to actually be worried about. I stopped googling my symptoms which has helped a great amount but this anxiety has not fully gone away. For anyone taking the time to read this thank you. It is a little bit of relief being able to express my feelings instead of keeping them inside.,Anxiety
34552,CT Scan coming up. I went to my primary a few weeks ago for what I suspected was a UTI. Turns out it wasn't and I was referred to a urologist. The doctor made me extremely nervous said there was some trace blood in my urine and wants me to go in for a contrasting CT scan and then have a cystoscopy. I'm beyond to pieces right now. I haven't been able to focus at work or at home. I just keep thinking it's cancer even though there's no history in my family of bladder or kidney cancers and I'm only 29. It's all I can do not to google myself into a panic attack. The tests are still a week away does anyone have any advice or any stories of similar events that might help me get through the next week.,Anxiety
34553,So worried any ideas what could be wrong? Hi everyone so basically for the paat month i've woke up everyday with headaches mostly tension headaches and the feeling of pressure. I also get flashes of light in my vision chills and a tingly feeling going through my whole body also pain in my arms and slight numbness in my fingers. 2 weeks ago i vomited aswell which really didn't help matters as i have a fear of vomiting.Im convinced i have a brain tumor but i went to the doctor and he shone a light into my eyes and said everything looked ok but i still dont believe him. I've have headaches from anxiety on and off in the past but they never lasted this long before.The last 2 months have been really stressful for me as my mum was in hospital with liver failure and i had to look after my dad during that time who is a schizophrenic. My anxiety was improving but this has brought me back down and i feel worse than ever.Does anybody know what it could be? Is it a stress reaction or could i really have a brain tumor? ,Anxiety

34555,Possibly letting anxiety get to me? I am the type of poster that you will hate. I'm fully aware that I am 90 of the time just blowing everything out of the water with anxiety it's been my MO for awhile.I was at a bar talking to some women when we had to run my cousin back across the street to the hotel due to him getting into arguments. When we came back there were shots on the table for us and I really remember almost nothing after that. The only thing I remember is being in a car with one of the ladies and that guy being really grabby from the backseat.Woke up at the lady's house the next morning and she dropped me off at my car. I've talked to her since and she's the guy did kiss me when we dropped him off. She said you did get out to piss at one point and he followed you out. Don't know what happened but you were only gone about 45 seconds and didn't say anything when you got back in.That was last Friday nightSaturday morning. It's not Sunday and I have been sick as fuck. Sore throat head stuffed up probably one of the worst coughs I've ever had. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind to me is HIV. As far as I've been told from her nothing happened that night aside from the kiss part. I have since noticed that the condom from my wallet is gone but that honestly could have been gone for awhile before hand. I may have just forgotten to replace it. I would think if anything else happened I would be a bit sore the next day. I obviously know nothing about this person so their status would be unknown to me.I know the general consensus will likely be that I am being overly anxious. But I know that I will not be able to calm down until I can be tested. Apparently HIV RNA tests are able to detect after 11 days? The only thing I can find about those is through this site httpswww.stdcheck.comhivrnatest.phpAnd I'm not sure how trustworthy that is. Thanks in advance!,Anxiety

34557,Obsessing over stools. Worried about parasites. I've been looking at almost every stool I pass for the past couple of months because I'm crazy and I have a fear of parasites.It seems to be only getting worse as now I'm afraid to eat some foods because of some stupid stories I read online. Yesterday I cut open a quinoa patty and almost had a panic attack because I didn't know quinoa looked like worms.Anyway back on the parasite topic. I've been passing weird white stuff for several months now and I think it's gotten more frequent somehow. Although I think it happens with every bowel movement.I posted on rAskDocs with a pic if you're brave enough to go look at it warning it's pretty gross as you might have guessed.I've also started washing my hands every time I touch something and I also check my bedsheets obsessively for anything suspect before I go to bed. I look at most foods with my phone's zoom too.I can't even pet my cats anymore because dandruff and flea eggs are like indistinguishable.Going crazy.,Anxiety
34558,Brain tumor anxiety Hey reddit. I'll start by saying that I'm a huge 22 year old hypochondriac. It started in last December when I pooped a lot of blood and I was convinced that I've got colon cancer I couldn't function properly for a whole month before I got my colonoscopy which revealed a small benign polyp which was removed. Anyways since yesterday all I've been reading about is brain tumors. The reason of that is when I was in work yesterday slept only 6 hours and didn't have breakfast then worked from 8 am to 2 pm I kind of tripped twice when I was standing and wanted to turn around. Like I'm clumsy overall and I sometimes trip or bump onto things but never so often. Also when handing the change to the customer I'm a student but I work part time as a cashier I dropped a coin twice. Or when he asked me for certain cigarretes I grabbed the blue instead of red ones etc. After the day of overall lack of concentration I started googling and I found that brain tumor may cause clumsiness loss of concentration balance etc. I had a CT scan done 4 years ago due to head trauma but it was clear. However I've read that tumors can grow fast. Should I go to doctor or observe myself for couple days? I've never head headaches as well. ,Anxiety
34559,My Health Anxiety Symptoms Hi Everyone! As someone who has been struggling with health anxiety for the last 4 years I have found the acknowledgment of potential anxiety symptoms to be the most reassuring form of support. This is not only reassuring to me as it reminds me of all of the different ways anxiety might affect your body it also reminds me and hopefully others that many of these symptoms quickly pass as they are only manifested only as a result of mental illness. Here's all of the symptoms that have come and gone as a result of my health anxiety. I hope that people may relate and be reassured. I've bolded those symptoms which have remained more constant throughout the last 4 years.tingling extremities cold hands and feet muscle spasms mostly in leg thought it was a blood clot it was not tightness of muscles particularly around neck and shoulders dry mouth bruxism chest pain stabbing chest pain dullachey constipationdiarrhea thought this was hypothyroidism it wasn't hair loss thought this was PCOS it wasn't Paralysis like symptoms this came in two ways. One overthinking things that should be unconscious me thinking about swallowing resulted in my temporary inability to swallow liquid. Two mid panic attack thought I could not move legs. pelvic vaginalvulva pain thought this was vulvar cancer literally got a chunk cut out of my vulva to test. As soon as results came back negative the pain stopped headaches HEADACHES pressure in head tightness insomnia lethargy difficulty concentrating hearing phantom ringing always hearing my alarm clock even when it's not going off jitters. That is all! I think. I hope this helped someone please feel free to ask any questions. ,Anxiety
34560,Not sure what is real and whats not anymore Hey guysI am a 29 year old female with two kids ages 6 and 11 I have had this illness since I was around 6. It would be to the point I would make myself hyperventilate and my heart would go nuts and go to the emergency room I would vomit all the time and be in serious pain. I had all sorts of tests and they were all negative. It died down a lot from ages 1324 but since then its been getting worse. It didnt help that for 3 weeks in 2016 I thought my symptoms of a bad headache neck pain and double vision was just my anxiety but it turned out to actually be meningitis!!! I was in the hospital for 7 days. Now every headache I freak out. Every rash I freak out. Stomach ache palpitation everything. Ill be at the store sitting in front of the bp machine for 10 minutes. I carry around a thermometer if I feel hot I check my temperature. I google non stop. I look in the mirror and smile to make sure Im not having a stroke. Its embarrassing and terrible! Lately I have been losing my memory and getting panic attacks when the light changes from high to low. I have a red rash on my face I cant get rid of. And I KNOW these arent made up.

34563,Feeling stupid lately... Alright so Im 16m have health related anxiety and have had this sort of thing before. Maybe someone has something wise to say.So I constantly worry about losing intelligence Im a pretty bright guy but I often worry that this attribute is slipping away from me. Im rather insecure about this.I work at a swimming pool thats under construction. There were diesel fumes in the pool the whole 3 hour shift. They were bad enough at one point to give a coworker a headache and at least one patron turned right around when she came in and smelled how and it was. Mgmt didnt close till the last 30 mins! I was one of the last on the deck. Didnt really get a headache though. Anyway I own a juul I was using that before and after. So nicotine exposure. Havent used it for a few days. Also I drank a bit with friends the night of that work shift. Continued using the juul and drank more the night of the next day. Also I was at higher altitude for two days after this but only 2000 ft higher than the 5000 of my hometown. Back home and still feel what Im about to describe. I feel like my memory has been shitty since this and my mentalcognitivelinguistic abilities down. I feel dull. Ive had scares like this before but this feels different. Is this just anxiety? Anxiety seems to cause very real physical symptoms for me but I feel less stressed than I normally would during this type of episode. Anyone have any words of advice? EDIT Forgot a MAJOR component I got a meningitis vaccine the day before the second drinking incident. Not an antivaxer at all I just was worried about the interactions between all these in relation to my memorymental issues recently. Kinda reinforces my point that I forgot this big part which was a primary part of my thoughts about this ,Anxiety

34566,Hantavirus freaking out vacuumed large amount of what looked like mouse droppings from engine bay of car. Im seriously worried right now. Heres my info. Male 21 yrs old 165 lbs 511No previous health issues and no medicationsI purchased an older vehicle from Alabama I live in northern Illinois on March 3rd 2018. It was shipped that day and arrived March 6th 2018. On March 25th 2018 I opened up the engine cover It is a van and discovered a large amount of broken nuts or acorns and what looked like mouse droppings small round pellets about the size of rice on top of the engine along with a few chewed wires. Im assuming that at some point this van sat for a period of time not sure if recently before purchase but I assume not as there are was no sign of a current infestation to the previous owner prior to purchase. Anyway fast forward to me cleaning it out a few days ago with a regular household vacuum. I dont believe I used a respirator mask for all of the time but if I did it was a 3 one that is made for basic things like sanding not for chemicals or pathogens. I vacuumed it up for quite awhile probably about an hr. My question is am I at risk for hantavirus? It seems that the virus wouldnt survive after excretion for very long and assuming that the mice were active until the very day that the van was picked up in Alabama unlikely there still wouldve been about 2.5 weeks between then and when I first opened up the engine compartment and another week or so until I vacuumed it up. Any knowledge or experience with this? Lifespan of hantavirus after excretion? Im killing my self over this and my anxiety is giving me a bunch of symptoms. Thank you in advance! ,Anxiety
34568,I'm so tired. I am 27 y.o male and I am so fucking tired. Every goddamn day that I wake up I have a brief moment of calm before everything gets going. When I wake up I am fine. 2 hours later I know that I am going to die in a couple of weeks. It never ever fucking goes away. Being a hypochondriac is going to either kill me from some fucking disease or it's going to make me kill myself. I havetried getting help from the psychiatric ward and I was actually seeing a therapist for a couple of weeks before they said that before we can go on I have to start taking my ADHD medication again. I said Ok fine thinking that it would only be a coupleof weeks before I could continue with the therapy sessions. It has now been over 3 months since I was in a session. It always keeps on gettingpostponed because a doctor quit or that there are many people waiting for a psychiatrist. I am so fucking tired of waiting so fucking tired of worrying about disease X and disease Y. The first time I started experiencing problems was this autumn. I went abroad and as soon as I landed I got a lot of problems with my stomach. Constipation dihareea. When I got back home I went to see a doctor who did a shit load of tests on me. Couldn't find a single problem with meother than possible lactose intolerance. So I went to another doctor who said it was most likely IBS. After a couple of weeks the problems wentaway until I was more or less completely normal. Then I noticed I started loosing weight. My thoughts automatically went to a number of horrible diseases. I started eating more and stopped taking my daily walks. Which I started because I was told it was good for anxiety. When my dad came to visit the latest batch of problems started showing up. A lump in the throat. It feels like I have somethingstuck in my throat that I am trying to swallow all of the time. It's not present the first couple of hours after I wake up but after a whileit sets in. So I went to the doctor today and described my issue and after an examination including blood tests and some stick in the throattests he said that he could not see anything. He mentioned Globus and I have read that that is connected with anxiety. I just can't seemto get it into my head that it is that and not something else. This is where I am at the moment.I am so tired of this constant worry all of the time and I am so tired of going to the doctor every other week trying to figure out if I am going to die next month or not. It is so fucking exhausting...The only medicine I have at the moment is Promethazine for my anxiety and I don't really know if it is helping or not. I guess it helps a little but only for a couple of hours. I am tired of this and thoughts of just ending it and getting it over with are constantly lurking around. What the fuck am I going to do?,Anxiety
34569,Change in stool? First post here! I know it's gross but I've noticed what I would call a significant change in my stool within maybe the last year. I don't go nearly as often and sometimes when I do it feels like it's very little or there's more in my body that I can't get out. I think that's kind of normal since I'm a 24yearold female and I know my metabolism has to slow down at some point but I feel uncertain about it. On top of that I have noticed a little bit of blood in my stool. I've have had trouble with hemorrhoids in the past so I'm pretty positive that's got to be what the blood is coming from. On top of THAT I've also noticed an increasing amount of mucus in my stool which I feel like my body may be producing to make up for my possible constipation. Anyway it worries me because I know colon cancer is becoming more prevalent in adults my age.

34571,Smaller stomach after hernia repair surgery Help Helloi am a 19 yo rather healthy female and i have underwent a hernia repair surgery a month ago.Im roughly around 66kg and 176cm tall. Now im not the most fit person and i had some stomach fat before the surgery and after. The past week has been different and i had started eating once or max twice per day since my loss of apetite and i noticed that my stomach is way way smaller than it used to be. Is this the cause of the said surgeryeating less food i was pretty inactive though or could there be another more worrying reason? I need advice.,Anxiety
34572,Has therapy helped you? Hi guys I just found this sub. I've had health anxiety my whole life but as of the past year it's gotten so much worse and it's really ruining my life. I feel like I have symptoms of OCD mixed in as well. There is always something I'm worried about and I suffer from intrusive thoughts regarding exposure to diseasecarcinogensetc extremely often. It has given me some kind of solace scrolling through this sub and seeing I'm not alone. I really would like to see a therapist regarding this issue and I'm wondering if any of you have done the same with positive results. Are any of you prescribed medication as well? I'm not keen on medication but I would take it if deemed necessary. TLDR I'm looking to get professional help. Has professional help helped to effectively treat your issues with health anxiety?,Anxiety
34573,Be careful of Google results. Don't click on calmclinic. Also my head hurts. I'd never seen the website before in my life but it was suddenly not only the promoted result and the top nonpromoted result when I googled a generic symptoms I know googling bad. I clicked out of curiosity seemed like an innocuous anxiety website it directed me to a test which then offered to send me indepth results via email no or I could get basic results which I clicked. Then a longass video with a woman promising she could cure me in just a few weeks no meds no therapy! It was really deceptive because the video suggested she would tell you the solution at any moment but eventually she asked for 78. It was an obvious scam to me and I knew that from the start but it was really well crafted. I doubt anyone here would fall for that sort of thing but if you see calm clinic in Google results click on the feedback button to report it as a scam. I think at one point the woman insinuated that if you thought the whole deal was too good to be true that also was your anxiety lol. Who tf can sleep at night after weedling mentally ill people for money?Anyway comes and goes but I've been getting this weird pressure headache generally around the crown and eyes.

Currently Im terrified I have a pulmonary embolism that my drs are missing. Ive been short of breath for a month now. I went to the ER and they did a CT with contrast and an XRay and said there was no PE especially since my blood ox was 100 and my BP was perfect. I accepted this for a little bit but now I fear they just missed it. My GP said its my asthma and allergies but since my inhalers arent working Im back to thinking a PE. I got dizzy recently so I called 911. They said blood ox was good and EKG was good and agreed it was my asthmaanxiety. The EMT said they can miss PEs on CTs though so Ive been spiraling since last Thursday. Im so scared this thing is missed and Im just going to drop dead. I cant talk to my husband about it because the subject just enrages him at this point. Im sitting here debating on going to the ER again for another CT but I also know thats crazy.

Like yeah hamburgers are arguably gross but I always thought they were just bad for you nutritionally and that was a lot easier to dismiss than hey your burger might be harboring a death sentence. I didn't learn about BSEvCJD until a few months ago. I feel disgusting. The only beef I really ever ate was ground beef whether it's from the store or from taco bell or some other burger joint. I ate ground beef frequently and carelessly. I have tiny muscle twitches frequently at night and it perpetuates my fear. What do you think the odds are that the beef I ate contained BSE? I'm reading that fast food ground beef uses the mechanically repurposed beef which is basically all the risk tissue smashed into a patty. I'm horrified and terrified. I have panic attacks nightly.

Panic attacks pulse checking spending way too much at the doctor's office the whole shebang. Around February I got on top of my shit and turned a leaf. My therapy healthy eating and exercise finally kicked in and I was literally like a new person. The health anxiety dissipated and I was able to function.

Ive been to the doctor about my heart and everything always checks out as normal but I cant keep the anxiety and worried thoughts away. The best form of coping that Ive used is showering. On a bad day Ill shower around 56 times a day. It seems to be the only place I can meditate and really relax and get my HR down. Im lucky to have at least that but its not very practical especially when Im trying to function with my day to day responsibilities school work socializing.

Despite that i have health anxiety and always thing Im gonna die lol. Well I went to the dentist recently and we scheduled a day to do some fillings and I have one tooth that needs to be extracted but was waiting for a later date. My fillings appointment is on Monday. Just my luck either the tooth that needs to be extracted or the tooth that needed a filling next to it got infected just yesterday. I had bad jaw pain and tooth pain and my face is swelling. Im taking some over the counter meds and trying to tell myself I can wait this out until my appointment on Monday. Im not in any pain anymore but my face is swollen still.Anyway I know a tooth infection left untreated can get worse and start breaking down your jaw and infect your heart and whatnot and the thought of that is really freaking me out.

34600,Working out worsening my anxiety Hey allI'll try to make my story as quick as possible. I've been working out for about 9 year now. I've battled forms of anxiety and depression my whole life. My health anxiety has been at an all time worst this past month. About a month and a half ago I took performance enhancing drugs PEDS. I stopped cold turkey after taking them for 12 days cause I saw some symptoms I didn't like. Ever since I've stopped my panics and anxiety have been killing me. My biggest fear is that I screwed up my heart just from those 12 days. I don't really fear anything else except for heart issues. I haven't been able to sleep since I've been in fear. I went to my doctor and she gave me all the physical tests took my blood pressure listened to my heartbreathing and checked my limbs for swelling and she said everything seemed fine.Yesterday I returned to the gym and working out makes me so nervous. I keep thinking any type of physical exertion is gonna cause my heart to stop. One symptom I've noticed is that I feel a weird bubbly feeling stemming from my upper left abdomen sort of where my chest meets my stomach and it feels like a weird pressurebubble rising through my stomachchest and throat on the left side. It's almost like I have to burp but can't. I noticed its been happening and its mostly when I workout. I'm super scared that I have AFib. Hoping this is just anxiety related or stomach related. I've been doing so much googling lately that I've come up with about 50 different possibilities of what it could be lol.,Anxiety

I tried it months ago but the fear I was going to have one multiplied and I couldn't stand feeling my heart beat.

He hasn't wanted me to go to therapy because I haven't committed to his solutions yet. I get and appreciate he's trying to help but I really wanted professional help. I went to them in tears a couple weeks ago saying please just let me get some professional help and my mom said she'd find someone. Fast forward to today and I found out she got my a family psychologist one that already sees my 10 year old brother he gets very angry.

I drink only beer intentionally so that the harm of alcohol is less. Recently however this is still becoming an issue. I let my alcohol addiction to beer to overrule my healthy life. I smoke a lot of cigarrettes and I drink beer every day. I also drink so much coffee. My life is good but recently I feel this anxiety. My overall performance is getting lower too.A few months ago I noticed that I have swelling exactly bellow my Xiphoid process. It is something internal. I have Gastrointestinal tract issues. I feel stomache discomfort as well as drifting issues regularly. I researched about symptoms and could not get any information about it...Recently I feel a lot of anxiety and it is messing my decisions and mental health already. I think this could turn into dementia or something serious. It could be a cancer as well I don't know.I could have possibly gone to a doctor but the problem is that I come from a poor family and owe around 500 euro for health care which I cannot spend at this point. I hope you guys could help me identify the possible reasons for all this so I can make some adequate response to it.. And I will see a doctor soon probably. I am just a bit scared and unaware of what I did to myself. Hope you guys support me and give me advice Thanks!EDIT Also I have been very anxcious around people ever since child. Every time I talk to someone I feel something like pain in my stomache and have to make effort for all my conversation. I ended up a quiet and lonely guy because of it. This is the whole reason I abuse alcohol cigarrettes and coffee. I wanted to overcome something psychological to be more connected. This abuse was obviously affecting my digestive system or something.. i don't know. I know that this will become a nightmare and could possibly be the reason for my death some day.Edit sorry I am actually 30 years old male. I am so embarrased right now.

34606,Sick of taking anxiety medication ast year I was paralyzed on my left side due to a lesion on my brainstem. I recovered thankfully and learned to walk talk and eat again. I have documented the last 15 months since being discharged. I have tried different medications a lot for my residual symptoms. Equilibrium and gait issues depression and anxiety cognitive issues and most importantly my severe neuropathy. If I didnt take my medicine I was so itchy and uncomfortable I would be clawing at my feet and legs and actually leaving pretty big cuts. I was losing my train of thought and having trouble finding certain words. I have been in the medical neurology field since I was 19 Im 34 now. I know about medical issues and treatments and all of them have such a negative impact on daily life. I had to make a change. I started taking CBD oil and weaned myself off all my meds. I feel great. My thinking has improved. My speaking skills are on point now. I am no longer losing bits and pieces of a conversation. I wish I did this sooner. Like I said I recovered but I was left with a lot of symptoms things that my grandparents are complaining of and even though Im only 34 this is my life now. I cant go on the rest of my life taking pills everyday. So now I take CBD oil in the morning and at night. I started out slowly and gradually increased it. I decided to start selling it to get a discount on my monthly oils. Im not a sales person but if I can benefit from this I am sure other people in the same boat as me could too. I was desperate and willing to try anything and now knowing I can take something that is all natural and not made by a pharmaceutical company and its legal makes me feel so good. I dont mind talking to you personally or just go to the website. httpwww.hempworx.comDfrizadoI I wish you luck on finding your cure to be pain free now that Ive tried this I am not going back to pharmaceuticals. ,Anxiety

34610,Struggling to discern between anxiety and real symptoms How does anyone manage to deal with health anxiety when you clearly have symptoms of something and it isn't just a general worry about dropping dead from cancer or a stroke? A couple of weeks ago I noticed I had air hunger that sensation that you aren't getting enough oxygen and I have begun to get vertigo dizzy or lightheadedness quite frequently. Here in the UK it is quite hard to get a Dr's appointment that isn't an emergency one and I have got one booked in for close to the end of the month. The last week has been horrible for me because while realistically as a 29 year old I am not at a huge risk of lung cancer or heart failure and I cannot stop obsessing about how serious this illness could potentially be. Especially because it is clearly not a common cold but if it is real maybe a viral infection like labyrinthitis. The problem is that the more I worry the more things happen like palpitations stomach ache and such like. All classic anxiety symptoms that I am sure are due to my HA but my mind just cannot reconcile that the simplest explanation must be true. Its the opposite of how i operate as I am a scientist and normally think very logically. In the past I have spoken to the GP about my HA but they don't really seem to do much about it. I asked if I could be refereed to someone but instead was told to look up selfhelp related stuff online. Weirdly I worry that being labelled as a hypochondriac on my medical records will bias a doctor towards me if I am require treatment. Just have no idea how I am going to get through the next few weeks until I can see a GP for a 10 minute lets do nothing and see what happens waste of time. ,Anxiety

After that I went straight home to rest .

During this time I convinced myself I was dying too many different ailments to list.I started having panic attacks usually when in a crowded area that were debilitating.Cue lots of therapy medication and 6 years later I felt I had it under control I still have bad days and symptoms but not as bad as previous. I haven't had a proper panic attack for a couple of years.Then today. I've had a cold for a few days and had taken my daughters to their dancing competition when suddenly I started to feel dizzy.

34620,Consistent head pressure around sinuses and vision has felt off for about a month. Is this anxiety? So for the past month I've had this strange consistent head pressure on the right side of my head around my sinuses and something about my vision has been off. It's the best way I can describe it. I've had my eyes and vision checked and they said everything looks fine. It's almost like the link between my eyes and my brain isn't quite working right. This also came on pretty suddenly out of nowhere. Other than that I don't have any other symptoms of anxiety to speak off. No panic attacks. I sleep just fine. I've always been a bad hypochondriac but I've never experienced physical symptoms like this so I'm not sure if I can attribute it to anxiety or something else. I've also been to the doctor and had blood work done and everything was fine there as well. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? If so how did you deal with it?,Anxiety

She talked about how she had a stroke at age 20 Like most of you my constant fear has been health related more so the fear of having a stroke. She described what happened during the stroke and it is absolutely terrifying. She said hat she was feeling fine and then all of a sudden the right side of her body was paralyzed. She couldnt even speak or make out any words. After listening to that I started freaking out immediately.

34625,Heart Disease depression anxiety and stress This semester I am taking Abnormal Psychology. One of the chapters I had the misfortune of reading was on the physical health effects of negative emotions something I am chocked full of. Whether its stress anxiety depression angerfrustration I show it. My mood bounces around a lot. Even at my young age of 23 I am starting to worry about developing heart disease something my neurotic nature seems to be a predictor of. Most of my life I've eaten a poor diet although my cholesterol was only 150 with my LDL at 88 and my HDL at 30. No idea about cortisol CRP or interlukins though. I have also been pretty sedentary though that is very slowly starting to change since I turned 18 and have had a slew of medical problems since then. My gums have receded more I fought off gingivitis but am on the cusp of developing gum disease from gum recession. I used to get very angry at video games I developed tinnitus a year ago which drives me crazy and I'm depressed and socially isolated. I have no know history of heart disease but of depression and low serotonin. Thus I am stuck in a dilemma. I also started taking amphetamine mediation for ADHD in January so my heart rate tends to be higher on average but I eat less and have lost weight. In some cases my blood pressure is normal on stimulants even when it feels elevated. I'm paranoid about my health a bit of hypochondriac. I vape don't drink anymore and and am an on and off smoker. All of these things and more point to heart disease. I cannot just relax however and I refuse to take antidepressants. I detest those medications and will take any medicine for depression that is not an antidepressant or antipsychotic. Even at the cost of my life from getting heart disease I will risk low mood higher inflammation and more clotting and an early death than take those. I have often been pointed to exercise as the key which I will do in the form of jogging. I will not do yoga even if its relaxing because I think its a stupid form of a exercise. I want a form of exercise where I can feel angry and aggressive. Maybe that defeats the point but at least its something. I need some answers within my confines. Diet changes are hard because I'm a picky eater and will throw up if something doesn't taste good. Regular good sleep is also out of the question because for some reason I rarely sleep more than 45 hours consecutively. Exercise is pretty easy I'm just a bit lazy. I'm open to ideas but antidepressants are absolutely out of the questions. ,Anxiety
34626,Terrified of a brain bleed... This sounds so ridiculous but I dropped my phone on my head yesterday from about an arms length. The corner of it just happened to hit me on the perfect spot right above my temple. It hurt pretty bad for a few seconds but then I didn't have much pain. I've stupidly been googling like crazy and keep reading about hits where people seem fine and then just die from a subdural hematoma and that they can take days to weeks to cause problems. Ughhhh I also take a daily baby aspirin for a blood clotting disorder and people on blood thinners have a higher chance of a bleed. I feel ridiculous I haven't have a trigger like this in a really long time!! Today I am having a mild headache and pressure in the base of my head. I'm terrified but I feel like going to the er would be overreacting to a bump from my stupid phone. I've been trying to keep myself from reaching out for reassurance but I can't help it today!

I went to the ER and got a ekgnormal heart attack blood marker testnormal and a chest xraynormal. While I was there I found out the funny heartbeats were ectopic beats.My primary care sent me for hotter monitorconfirmed benign ectopic beats stress testnormal and echocardiogramnormal. This still wasnt good enough for me so I asked to have a CT angiogram to make sure I had no blockages. This came back clear.I had a couple good weeks and was getting good at ignoring my funny heart beats and then just days ago I started to focus on odd feelings in my left chest almost under my armpit. No sweat shortness of breath or any other symptoms. So I went to the Emergency room and of course everything normal.No matter how many times I tell my self to calm down everything is alright. It just does not work and I just focus more and more. Its really getting to me ,Anxiety
34628,Anxiety panic and my heart I dont really get it I mean I do but I dont at the same time. Like today I just had a really bad panic attack all because I went for a walk. Im 26 and quit smoking about a month ago now. I know nothing is wrong with me except that I used to smoke and am struggling with things like shortness of breath etc. but every time I get my heart rate up even a little or feel short of breath my anxiety kicks in then quickly turns into a panic attack. I get ALL the usual symptoms tight chestchest pain light headed fast heart rate and those agitating urges to hit the toilet among other things. Im afraid of having a heart attack and constantly monitor my heart. Its debilitating because I dont want to go for once enjoyed walks a run or even work...nothing that would increase my heart rate even a little. I really do hate it and I just want to get over it but the slightest internal change just sets off my panic. Ive been to several doctors though not since I stopped smoking and everything has always come out fine. No heart problems on ekgs ultra sounds or Xrays etc. No major problems in the slightest. My mom thinks Im insane. She used to have panic from excessive worrying but never health related anxiety. Shell confront me about it sometimes and I think its just so she can tell me how crazy I am anymore. As soon as I try to explain my fear she rolls her eyes waves her hand and walks off with some ridiculous verbal response. I wonder how shed feel if people did that to her years ago with her excessive worrying. Ive told her to stop talking to me about it if shes going to be that way but it hasnt deterred her. She tells me shes been right where I am but got over it and treats me like an inferior because the magic trick she used doesnt just work for me like it did her. I call it magic because it was like she was all better over night. ,Anxiety
34630,Brain Neuro issues? Hi allLike a lot of people with h.a. my biggest fear is having a brain tumor.So I've had some weird vision things for the past year and I've been to an opthalmologist twice because the first time wasn't enough apparently. I sometimes see glittery floaters or what appears to be a quick line through my vision. Also I sometimes have funky peripheral sparkles. My opthalmologist performed intensive tests and said my eyes look extremely healthy. I think I'm seeing these things because of my anxiety and stress of my life as a college student. It's just very concerning it doesn't seem to go away... But the doc probably knows best.Also commonly headaches are pretty common...Finally maybe once a year I'll have an ocular migraine where I get some weird vision tricks and my lips and fingers seem numb. Although these are probably nothing major I've been wanting to get an MRI just to be sure.Mother thinks most of this is caused by me over committing to activities and my academic stress in college but some of these symptoms seem so real it's hard to not think it's a neuroloical issue. Ive been told to try deep breathing and exercise. Have of you experienced these things?Thank you everybody... ,Anxiety

I've seen earlier a post about colon cancer anxiety so I decided to blow off some steam by telling my story.It all started last summer when I had a weird pain in my left abdominal area. Went to my GP said it was nothing but that I should have a blood test I was 20 at the time. I found out I had an important Calcium deficiency and after I took some supplements the pain disappeared. Fast forward to last week that pain came back exactly in the same spot. Now I'm going once or sometimes even twice a day compared to my usual routine of once in two days. The pain fades away after bowel movements and that put me at ease for a couple of days but today I saw in a stool some darkbrownish spots which I believed to be blood.This has gone too far. I have no idea what I should do but I want to get out from this dumb situation. I don't enjoy life the way I used to because of some stupid thoughts.,Anxiety

My symptoms are blood while defacating especially while constipated but when I'm not I sometimes feel my anus hurt and see the blood on the paper then diarrhea constipation pain on the right side of abdomen for over a year now it comes and goes now it's mostly in my upper back extreme fatigue I've had black stool once but it was after drinking red wine so I thought then that's the causeI'm also scared the cancer is already in my bonesspine as my back often hurts and I can feel some kind of dent in my spine. I'm also diagnosed with severe anxiety duh so sometimes it's hard to tell which symptoms are real For example my fiancee tells this dent in my spine it's just my muscles contracting because of my anxiety. The same can be said about diarrhea fatigue... But then again how do I know when it's anxiety and when it's real?I know I should just wait for the colonoscopy in 4 weeks but I can't function properly right now. I've made mistake and visited a forum for colon cancer survivors and not only they all have symptoms similar to mine but lot of them were very young like me. My doctor told me it's probably IBS and hemorrhoids but my mom had colon cancer at 50 and I've read it's getting more and more common in young people and here I am crying myself to sleep every night because I'm convinced I'm dying.

34640,How to escape an HA hole when the symptoms persist? Ive been sick for awhile with a diagnosed but generally not serious sinus infection but lately Ive been noticing some other things which I wont mention so you dont fall down the same hole Im in and those things of course led me to the worst possible idea Googling my symptoms. I came across something rare sporadic and deadly of course and Im now constantly worried that its something that could be far more serious. Even though I went to my general practitioner for the sinus infection today and mentioned the other strange symptom I didnt mention the name of the specific thing I think I could have because it felt ridiculous and the symptoms were subsiding. He felt the area and chalked it up to side effects of the sinus infection but of course since he didnt SPECIFICALLY say its not and the symptoms have come back im now back to spiraling between youre just making it worse and maybe I should make sure just to be safe. Any advice to get my mind off of the possibility when I still feel like Im feeling the symptoms? I have this huge urge to go back to a doctor and get specific reassurance but I know thats problematic in the long run and could end up getting expensive for no real reason. Not to mention Id feel a bit ridiculous. Really starting to think I should see a psych as I havent since my anxiety began as a more generalized disorder a little over a year ago ,Anxiety

34644,Balamuthia I have severe health anxiety. I go to therapy for it and had it well under control. However in January my ex husband passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. We have a daughter together. Since then this shit has been out of control. I can't leave her parentless. I can't. In my depression and mourning since her dad died we have been pretty inactive. I'm not a gardener. I don't plant things. I take care of my house plants and that's it. On a whim I bought some flowers at WalMart. I thought it would be nice for us to plant them together. I wanted get back into being a normal mom a good mom. So we're outside planting these beautiful flowers. I'm a hypo already and I couldn't stop thinking about damn N. Fowleri of all things. I know I can't get it from dirt but we were breathing in so much of it! I didn't know to wet the ground before digging. We just went after it. I thought breathing through my mouth would keep me safe. Wrong and stupid. By the time we get back inside my nose is all stuffy and my throat hurts. I assume this is from dirt and allergens. I ignored my compulsion to Google for a little while. Then I got a weird metallic taste in my mouth and that was it. I found Balamuthia Mandrillaris. FML. Fast forward two days. My eyes hurt like they're tired. I had some brief photo sensitivity but I attributed that to playing Skyrim all day yesterday in an attempt to maintain control over my thoughts. My sinuses are still full but I'm not congested. I can feel popping and pressure in there but no snot and I can breathe fine. My irrational brain tells me that this is a direct result of amoeba eating away my soft tissue. It is not possible for this to be run of the mill allergies or a sinus infection. My head doesn't throb or anything. It's a like a sinus headache but very vague. I can move my neck and all just fine. I don't know if I have a fever. The kid hid the thermometer some where. It's messed up I felt fine when I woke up this morning. No nasal problems. It wasn't until later on it started up again. Now my face is twitching in weird places. Which I read is also a symptom of the amoeba infection. I already know this is rare. I've researched it thoroughly. I'm scheduled to see my doctor tomorrow but I want to go to the ER. I can't just up and take my kid with me though. I can't let this shit disrupt her life. She's spent many hours with me in the ER already. What am I supposed to do though? I know something isn't right. I don't want to die. I don't want to leave my baby alone.

Has it infused with my brain?? I left it too long!?? My skin and moles have never been a trigger for me in the past despite it being a likely genuine health problem for me fair skin family history etc. How am I going to get through the next week until I get the results?? Usually I can have small comfort that my fears are somewhat irrational.... ,Anxiety
34651,Worried after burning nonstick pan? I was heating up a nonstick frying pan earlier and left it on high for about 10 minutes after forgetting about it. It started smoking I realized what was going on and I grabbed the pan and ran it under water. I turned on a fan and went about my business for another 10 minutes in the slightly smokey room.Suddenly I became anxious and looked up if this could be harmful and found several articles about something called polymer fever? I definitely have a bit of a scratchy throat and feel kind of weird but I don't know if I'm just imagining it.,Anxiety

34659,HA strikes again... So... Im not looking for reassurance or diagnosis or anything really I guess. But I just had to share with some people who might understand.I have a long history of health anxiety. Cant get a cold without convincing myself I might be dieing. Frequent rabies scares. Ive convinced myself something was seriously wrong a couple times a month for years. Ive mostly talked myself out of seeing a doctor because I know its just anxiety and I dont want doctors to think Im crazy or wasting their time.A few days ago though... I found a lump under the skin above my right rib cage. So I did the logical thing and poked around for a lump on my left side... I thought maybe I felt a smaller similar lump and talked myself off the ledge.But now I can actually see a lump on my right side in the mirror. And when I prod around it feels like there might be a cluster of small lumps only one is visible though.So... of course Im worried it might be cancer although Dr. Google tells me theres all sorts of benign explanations.Im currently talking myself into seeing a doctor for peace of mind. But I hate the doubt telling me this is anxiety and Ill be wasting the doctors time. Im terrified the doctor will label me with hypochondria.I dont know why Im posting this. Im just frustrated that I can be terrified of illness and doctors at the same time.Anxiety is torture that worms into everything and just makes me feel so confused.,Anxiety
34660,Palpable lymph node Im terrified... So two and a half weeks ago I went to the dentist with a tooth that was shaky after a previous filling had fallen out. Id been feeling a bit weird in my throat on the same side too. She looked it and firstly said it appears I have gingivitis. She had to extract my tooth surgically by altering the gums and said it was infected so put some medicine in it and temporarily closed it. The next day I went back and she opened it all up and then sutured my gums back together. When she checked my lymph nodes mainly under my neck I directed her to the mandibular node which had been noticeably hard for maybe a week before. She called it a palpable node and said it could be due to the infection and the antibiotics amoxicillin she prescribed should take care of the infection. Well almost three weeks later and Im freaking the fck out. My infection appears gone and Ive had no pain on that side since the extraction. My lymph node is still as palpable as before but whats worrying me is that its painless whereas when its an infection its usually quite tender? Its hard but a bit rubbery and moves around. It couldve been around a lot longer than just the three weeks its been since I need to push it out a little from against my jaw to feel it but I can REALLY feel it. I had a couple of random lumps in my armpit groin and side as well and whilst it felt hard they had sort of pus coming out of the end so I assumed they were harmless as they went down after a couple of days. This was before the dentist. Im scared its lymphoma. The reason for this isNight sweats Ive had this onoff for the past few years however. But Ive noticed it again despite keeping cool. Temperature regulation out of nowhere Ill get quite warm and then get a bit chilly again. The node is pretty much painless but despite the infection going its still the same size and hardness. General fatigue but I have that anyways recently its been muscle achesIm a smoker... and at times in the past year Ive been very heavy. Im just freaking the fck out. Can anyone let me know if they had anything similar? Or just put my mind at ease?I know I should go to the doctors but Ive just built up such a resistance to it with how much anxiety Ive had over it. I fear having to face the issue and find out I have something serious. Im booking a GP appointment for a couple of days time. But until then anyone have a clue what this could be? its slowly consuming every second of my life. ,Anxiety
34661,I convinced myself that I have esophageal cancer. So I am 22 years old without any known digestive issues like GERD or anything. However for a couple of weeks now my stomach hurts like hell everytime I swallow something like a cramp when the food is passing into it.The last few month have probably been the most stressfull of my life so I had a lot of acid reflux issues which in turn can lead to only one logical conclusion that it hurts because my esophageal cancer is blocking most of the pipes and that I am going to die s.The symptoms have gotten better over the last week now while I had vacation and only swallowing large portions causes the pain or when there is a lot of sauce on it. But that is a state I reached a few weeks back and it eventually retuned.Anyone have some input here because I know how much of a hassle it would be to get my doc to order a gastroscopy. So far he only gave me these acid absorbing pills or something like that but I am not sure that they helped all that much.EDIT Sorry for spelling errors in advance english is sadly not my first language,Anxiety
34662,Scared of HIV extreme anxiety dont know what to do Hello folksSoo for a long time I had enlarged lymph node behind my ear. Then I went to the doc. She looked very worried. Sent me to bloodwork for a few tests. Then I became very anxious like my life will soon end then I somewhat learned to deal with it I became less anxious then more anxious again as I got sick frequently. Recently not only the lymp node got bigger I got a few test results from blood work.I have not good levels of some stuff but I cant understand it and I dont wanna research HIV results not here yet. Bad thing is I am always anxious feel like my life will really change. I have thoughts of how the area behind my ear will hurt very much and I would need operation.

34664,Would you go to the doctor again? Alright. This is a pretty long story... I haven't had a UTI for about 5 years I'm a 27 yo F but about a month ago I was in China and got one. Went to the doctor to get antibiotics took them for 5 days. 2 days later I developed super intense middle super low abdominal pain that almost made me faint Broke out into a sweat couldn't stand ears began ringing.Went to hospital where they ran some tests and said the infection was still there so they gave me another batch of antibiotics. These made me feel super ill every night btw at this point the UTI stinging symptom is long gone and by the 5th night I felt sick af and was vomiting.Went to hospital the day after and I still had the infection. So 3rd batch of antibiotics. Went to hospital the 3rd night because I was nervous I had a UTI that lasted so long. They told me I still had an infection and that it was severe So I should stay at hospital. Didn't feel comfortable doing that in a foreign country so I got on a plane to Melbourne where I'm from the next day. Dad picked me up and took me to hospital. I did indeed still have an infection so they gave me a new batch and sent me on my way I was asymptomatic at that point. 3 days later I have muscle aches in my leg I start feeling super weak and my heart rate was really high 180 when I arrived at emergency shortly after being admitted I developed diarrhea. Doctor on duty thought I might have an undertreated UTI so they administered new antibiotic via IV. I was discharged the next morning.Considering how long this UTI lasted I followed up and had a new urine test 8 days later last Monday Called my GP's office last Wednesday and the results were normal yay! But was feeling worried because since Tuesday I felt ultra uncomfortable in that region down there. Had an ultrasound on Thursday and went back to the doctor on Friday explaining my concerns. He told me my test results from earlier in the week were completely normal so it was highly unlikely anything was wrong. Gave me some tablets they apparently usually give to old ladies with bladder issues.Started feeling okay Friday night and Saturday. This morning Sunday I woke up and started feeling the same horrible sharp pain that almost caused me to faint in China. It's right below my belly button but at the pubic bone and it's SUPER fucking sharp and intense I've taken 6 paracetamol tablets today spread out But the pain hasn't completely disappeared. All this shit is making my hypochondriac tendencies go mental. It's almost 230am and I'm struggling to sleep because I feel so uncomfortable. I saw the doctor on Friday I know but this pain is fucking intense. Am I being paranoid or should I go back to the doctor tomorrow? I feel kinda stupid because he kinda laughed me off on Friday too... but... I'd also rather be safe than sorry. What would you do? ,Anxiety
34665,I might be dying and my anxiety is going nuts I might have messed up yesterday. I'm an avid codeine user. I don't do hard drugs because I'm too scared of damaging my brain or other organs but over the years it has become increasingly difficult to lead a normal life without the help of a substance considering that I have severe anxiety depression depersonalization derealization and Pure O. So I started to consume codeine once in a few weeks in order to be able to function correctly since I've tried around 20 antidepressants and SSRIs and nothing worked for me.Yesterday I took another dose. I buy OTC pain relief pills which contain codeine phosphate but they also contain paracetamol acetaminophen and aspirin and in order to stay safe you need to do a cold water extraction in order to remove the acetaminophen and aspirin from the pills. Opioids are highly soluble in water so the codeine dissolves and the other ingredients get filtered through a fabric and removed from the water leaving a crystalclear substance containing just codeine. However I was in a hurry yesterday stupid excuse to overlook my safety I know and I didn't wait long enough for the water to reach the right temperature it needs to be around freezing temperature but not frozen and I did the extraction anyway. The water came out very milky and that is a sign that the extraction was not successful. I didn't know the water needs to be COMPLETELY clear and I didn't look it up...I took the substance anyway.A few hours later I did some reserch and found out that I might have potentially intested 4 grams of paracetamol and 5 grams or aspirin. 4 grams of paracetamol is a risky amount because it can cause liver damage. The liver then continues to selfdestruct over a period of 2 weeks !!! without showing any serious physical symptoms so there's no way to know whether I overdosed or not...it ultimately leads to necrosis and then painful slow death. ampnbspI am at a loss and don't know what to do. My health anxiety is sky rocketing right now. I wish I would've been more careful but the deed is done now. Does anyone here have experience with paracetamol poisoningoverdose? I'm going nuts right now...,Anxiety

34667,Selfdiagnoses panic attacks and hope Here's my story. Last summer I convinced myself that I had intestinal parasites and kind of lost it. I finally went to the doctor and it turned out to just be a yeast infection health anxiety right?. Well it was a really intense yeast infection. Got it under control after finishing medicine from doctor and then purchasing OTC medicine. Then I started noticing that my digestive system was totally out of whack and was experiencing a constant fatigue and strange stomach aches that would appear out of nowhere in my lower abdomen. The aches would be sharp and burning I felt like I got a hot flash and then they would go away after only 1 or 2 minutes and I'd feel fine. So I convinced myself I had a stomach ulcer thanks WebMD. I conquered my health anxiety once again and returned to the doctor. Up to this point I've never had any real health issues in my life and pretty much never went to the doctor unless I got sick. Except that I was diagnosed with high risk HPV which had recently been clearing up. That's another story. So they do a breath test for H.pylori and take my blood. The blood test shows I have elevated bilirubin and they do an abdominal xray and ultrasound. No stomach ulcer. And nothing in the xray or ultrasound that indicates something wrong with my organs. Around this time I begin having panic attacks because I feel like something is very wrong with me. And then my skin on my face goes insane. Small red bumps everywhere and flaking off all over and so much redness. I get a prescription cream and it gets worse. I also get a prescription for a mild anxiety medication. The anxiety medicine makes me feel SO light headed which triggers more anxiety because I feel light headed when I have a panic attack. I started a glutenfree diet because I felt like it matched some of my symptoms. Started taking probiotics every day and my digestive issues have gotten so so much better. I went in for a followup blood test that showed my bilirubin levels are now normal. I realized the lightheadedness of my medication was caused by consuming grapefruit. I've finally gotten my skin under control with daily chemical peels and tea tree oil and it's improved a lot though still nothing like it used to be. So I've made a lot of progress. However I still feel very fatigued most days. While glutenfree has definitely helped and I think I'm getting a better hold on my anxiety in the back of mind I'm still afraid something is wrong. Can anyone relate? I'm reminding myself that I've made a lot of progress and I think my initial health scare just triggered this health anxiety that I had never had before. ,Anxiety

34672,Stomach related cancer Hey guys....I've been having problems with my stomach lately it started on September. Basically I had tons of things to do on my uni got really stressed out and started feeling like my stomach or better yet the area above it felt heavy. I started running by that time and I ran almost every day until the real winter kicked in around two month period. I also started eating more healthy and I stopped eating after 7PM for quite some time. While I ran I almost felt as if a weight was in my chest and as if it was jumping while I was running so I visited my doc.In the meantime I lost quite some weight. I was usually around 100kg 5 and last time I tracked my weight I was at 83.The doc basically said it's all stress related and she took my blood urine and stool sample.Stool gt negative for H. PyloriUrine gt everything good except high amount of proteins in urine I had wisdom teeth extracted and took antibiotics a week before so I'm not sure if it's related to that if anyone has something smart to say regarding this...please doBlood gt All goodShe gave me a prescription for Controloc pills proton pump inhibitor and told me to take them for two weeks at least.Well newsflah. I'm stupid. First of all I started taking them and the situation improved. So I stopped taking them after around 5 days forgot one day and figured oh well if it doesn't hurt it's fixed. Then another period of high intensity workload on uni arrived and so did the pain. I started taking them again but for a week and it improved a little. Later I figured I won't be my own doctor and I stopped taking them so for a while I felt just a minor annoyance above stomach but nothing alarming or hurting so I ignored it.Now back to another high intensity period my stomach is going crazy again I google telling myself not to do it but hey I said I'm stupid didn't I?The moment I read about bla bla cancers of this and that caused by gastritis I totally lost it.If I had these symptoms on and off considering I didn't take my meds as I was supposed to how bad did I fk up my stomach? Could this half a year have made any permanent damage? I'm terribly afraid of well...pain doctors disease and death nice combo in fact so nice that it keeps me scared but not scared enough to face my fear of doctors and operations.Yesterday it was hell I took 2x20mg Acipan same thing as Controloc basically and I feel a lot better but my mind is still in a terrible place. I guess this turned out into a rant rather than a question but still... any comments are welcome.sidenote I read that the usual period of taking controloc or similar pills for such symptoms is at least 4 weeks considering I didn't take even 14 of the given time is it possible it's simply the gastritis coming back every time?,Anxiety

34676,Have been getting sick fairly often This year I've been getting sick a lot. Back in October I believe I had a flu. 102 fever for 5 days straight respiratory symptoms etc. but I never got swabbed. Then in December I had a cold. I caught another cold again in January and then Influenza A in February. Now just a week ago I caught another respiratory virus. It wasn't another flu because I got tested and the swab was negative but it also seemed much worse than a cold I had fevers up to 102. A week fever free but I'm still very congested. In between all of this I've had random sore throats as well. I'm worried something more is happening whether it's some sort of auto immune problem or something else possibly worse. I'm getting a metabolic panel tomorrow so hopefully that'll answer some of my concerns. I'm hoping it's just a vitamin deficiency but of course my mind goes straight to something serious like cancer or something like that. This is also fairly recent of a problem. I've always had a lower immune system but I've never been this constantly sick. ,Anxiety

Is this resting blood pressure laying supine for 20 minutes or standing or moving upright? Because if it's resting my blood pressure doesn't seem to be below 90 but if it's moving about it does go below 90 systolic. To be clear I'm a very unfit person though I'm relatively slim.

34682,Is face burning sensations something that can be attributed to anxiety? My life has been a big mess since August. A dizziness episode triggered my health anxiety. I suspected MS did an MRI an SSEP they found nothing. Then I moved onto ALS. Nothing again. Several neurologists said I had nothing but anxiety and still I kept thinking the opposite.In January I woke up with my right side tinglingpins and needles followed by a toothache. Of course I googled these symptoms and found Trigeminal Neuralgia a condition that checks all the boxes of a hypochondriac nightmare.I had a cavity did a root canal the toothache disappeared. But the tingling is still here and around my eye I have been dealing with burning sensations eyelid eyelashes inside the eye. It's not unbearable and maddening like those who have trigeminal neuralgia say it is but it's really uncomfortable.I've seen two major neurosurgeons about this they said I didn't have trigeminal neuralgia. I don't know I can't find peace I'm always startled nervous and expecting to be hit by a major wave of unbearable pain. I really don't know anything anymore. Don't know if is my HA causing this or if in fact I have this condition but doctors are simply being dismissive. One thing that makes me believe that my anxiety is the root is that the burning gets tuned downdisappears when I'm distracted. But it hits me again when I'm alone at home working for instance.Oh well long post already. Anyone with similar experiences? Thank you,Anxiety

34685,Very scared about having an appointment scheduled at a cancer center. So April 18th I went to a free clinic because I cant afford healthcare I had acid reflux. But the doctor ordered my feces to be examined for ulcers that checked out fine they also drew blood to see if I was ok. They scheduled a return appointment to see how my acid reflux was doing. The next day in a voicemail they left a message saying it was very important of me to keep my appointment bc my thyroid levels were low. I kept it. Returned for the appointment which was about 23 weekend later. We talked about my acid reflux for like a minute and then everything shifted to my thyroid. She said I have Hyperthyroidism and she wanted my neck to be scanned to see what kinda of treatment I needed which could be a pill taken for 13 years surgery or radiation. The radiation part alarmed me so I asked immediately if it was cancer smiling she said no. I went home looked up the symptoms of hyperthyroidism but only 1 or 2 seem to match. A week later I called back bc I never got a call to schedule my appointment they said I would be called Monday again no call Wednesday I get a call and I was scheduled for the appointment which is a 2 day process for some reason. Monday at 900 later at 200 then Tuesday at 900 again. Its also in a cancer center which worries me so much and I cant stop thinking about it. Should i relax? Does anyone see anything positive in this? ,Anxiety
34686,Please give me some advice This all started about two months ago I went about 4 days without eating to help me lose weight. That Thursday I decided to start eating again so me and the family went to eat Mexican. I ate a small plate of fajitas not spicy. On the way home I felt my heart rate go WAY up and started pounding really hard. Then I started to feel like my chest was tight and I couldnt breathe properly and my hands and face began to get pins and needles. The pins and needles spread all over my body and I got this enormous pressure in my lower diaphragm. All of my joints locked up and I couldnt move. I could speak but it was slurred. They took me to the ER and after taking several tests including a EKG a CT scan of my brain and a battery of blood tests they concluded it was a low potassium level in my body which triggered a panic attack. Ok. So the next Tuesday I went to my primary care doctor for a follow up to check my potassium level and on the way I began to get that tingling and pressure in my chest again I pulled over got something to drink and made it to the doctors office. Potassium came back fine. The feeling didnt go away. All the rest of that day I felt like I couldnt breathe. The next day I went to a minor emergency center and after even more tests on my heart lungs and veins they concluded that I was fine and it was probably just anxiety. 3 days later. Went to the ER because the feeling still hasnt gone away and it is getting hard to live my life. Same thing a bunch of tests and concluded nothing. Doctor said it might be a ulcer in my stomach and put me on medication. One week later and it only got worse. I went back to the ER and they took even more extensive tests and still found nothing. I was desperate to feel better it had been two weeks of constant suffering. I went back to my primary doctor and he ordered more tests and a copy of the results from the ER. He found what appeared to be a hiatus hernia in my stomach and gave me a acid reducer. It has gotten better but still hasnt gone away. It has been almost two months since that Tuesday and I havent gotten even one minute of relief. My heart pounds constantly my stomach bloats Im always cold I have pain in my chest I cant take a deep breath and Im always tired. I feel like if someone cant help me Im going to die. I dont know if this was the right sub to post this on but nobody else will really listen to me. I have had worrys like Im having a heart attack. A few days ago I was helping my dad move a water tank. I got a scratch on my arm somehow. Afterwards something flew by my arm. Probably a large insect like a dragonfly but my mind immediately thought it was a rabid bat and it had just flew by and scratched me. A few days later I lay down to go to bed and I start feeling cold my heart starts pounding and I get scared and start googling. I had read a story about rabies on Reddit a while back that scared the shit out of me. I began reading the symptoms and convinced myself that I have only days to live. I dont believe rationally that I have rabies. My state has not had a human case in the last 30 years. But Im so damn scared and there is nothing I can do about it. Any advice to make me feel better? I feel like I have fever but I have no temperature and I feel a pressure in my face. I havent slept in 2 days,Anxiety
34687,Pain in left thighleg and muscle spasms freaked out about DVT again I've been afraid of DVT since early March because I have had various weird spasms and pain in my left leg. It happened twice that I woke up with immense pain and cramping in that leg. This happened to me when I was a kid sometimes but I don't remember if it was just in one leg then. I've had two doctors tell me that my pain and symptoms don't match those of DVT and that I need to stop Googling so I'm laying off the Google now...The pain was mostly gone the last two weeks but right now I have a lot of cramp and a burning sensation in that same leg again and it seriously makes me anxious.I also have another issue. I got meds for my anxiety gabapentin and lexapro but I am afraid to take them because of the possible side effects. I have been taking gabapentin but it only helps for a few hours. Lexapro seems more dangerous and I don't know if I'll just worry myself by thinking about the symptoms. Anyway thanks for letting me get this off my chest. ,Anxiety

34689,Your honest opinions please! Ok so I have struggled with hypochondria for going on three years now. Last night my girlfriend was puppy sitting for a coworker and I stopped by to bring dinner and hang out with the cute puppy for a while.As puppies do he was a little bit of a biter and at one point he got in a little deep just above my elbow on my bicep. I pulled my arm away but it dragged a little bit and drew a little blood so i assumed it punctured the skin. He's only a few months old and apparently he went to the veterinarian four days ago. I haven't confirmed that he got a rabies vaccination there. I think he would have but I don't remember what all my dog got when i took him home two years ago. This puppy who bit me came from a shelter. So please tell me honestly should I be worried about rabies? Should I go to the doctor just in case? I could use a level head's perspective on this.,Anxiety
34690,Terrified I have myocarditis and will suddenly die soon I've been suffering coldlike viral symptoms for the last 10 days and I'm terrified the virus will attack my heart in a condition known as myocarditis. It began as a sore throat and a constant need to clear my throat but has now progressed to a hacking productive cough. I have also had some chest pain today although admittedly it feels muscular.Roughly 4 days into my symptoms 6 days ago now I went to ER and they performed ECG and took blood. Cardiac troponins were not elevated and ECG was normal. However I can't get my mind off the idea that because my viral symptoms have worsened the virus is attacking my heart and I now have myocarditis.Is it worth going to ER again for an ECG and cardiac troponins to put my mind at ease? I've been reading reports over at the myocarditis foundation website and what strikes me as particularly terrifying about this disease is its tendency to randomly cause sudden death without prior warning. I mean as a health anxiety sufferer whose condition arises from a fear of death this is the worst illness I ever could've learned about. ,Anxiety
34691,My mind is tricking me into feeling like I need to urinate A couple of years ago I went on a vacation with my family. I had bladder issues at the time so I spent 12 the trip worrying that I would constantly feel like I need to go to the toilet and that it would ruin the trip for me. Ever since then every time I go to see a movie I'm anticipating I love and am very passionate about movies I will fear that my mind will trick me into feeling like I need to go to the toilet and this fear will cause my mind to trick me into feeling like I need to go and it will ruin the experience for me.I'm currently scared this will happen to me with the new Avengers and I'm already constantly thinking about and feeling like I need to go to the toilet. I've seen several doctors and we've all concluded that it is a mental thing but I don't know how to solve it. I'm constantly thinkin about the toilet and feeling like I need to go. Does anyone have any advice on how I can fix this? Thanks.,Anxiety

This means I'm not at a higher risk for penile and headneck cancer.I really hate life sometimes.,Anxiety

34698,Could an Acute HIV rash start as one bump and spread up the lower arms? I had a rash on my lower arms 3 weeks after possible exposure with no other symptoms. It started with one itchy bump and then it sort of spread around my arms but it wasn't too bad. I went to the doctor and he told me it's allergic reaction from switching body washes frequently. It was there for about a month or so. This was about 6 months ago and I did not feel the need to get tested. It crosses my mind every now and then so I wanted feedback.,Anxiety

34701,Nodule in neck So I've had this bump under my skin near my jaw for about 6 months now. I went to the doc a few months ago and was told to come back if it doesn't go away. It didn't disappear so I returned and was scheduled for an ultrasound on my neck. The doc then sent me to get a CT scan of it. I'm worried that I've got cancer or something.

34702,It's officially affecting my every day life The anxiety meds aren't responding. I got finished with an eye doctor appointment who told me my eyes were fine the initial cause of this got one night of rest after 3 weeks of anxious manic hell and it started up the next day. It moved from my eyes to other health concerns. It just never stops. I've talked to my therapist but I don't know when I'll see my psychiatrist next. I'm losing sleep. I'm barely hanging in there. I'm being a good girl and staying away from google but still continuously performing body checks every few hours and obsessing over random sensations and tingles on my body. Sleeping is the worst. I can't at all. I toss and turn. Wake up from panic attacks. Have vivid nightmares. It's just all gone to hell after years of building up and I don't know what to do. I've attempted grounding meditation nature sounds reassuring myself etc etc. It builds back up.I'm not sure where to go next or what to do. Maybe more doctor appointments if it even helps anymore. Sometimes I think they're lying to me. Sometimes my brain tells me they either missed something or just aren't trained enough. I'm just crying right now because I feel so defeated. My brain has collapsed into itself and I can't escape it anymore.,Anxiety

34704,21MFIRST TIME HERE THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP GIVEN TO ME. Hi guys never posted here before however I am in a very dark place right now with my life and don't really know how to start this but for a while now I have felt very low and have felt as if I am becoming a different person as I no longer find happiness in myself as I did before I am a university student also working in retail as well as recently being signed to a modelling agency and I often feel as if I have to put a happy face on everyday and I am honestly tired of having to do this it is physically as well as mentally draining. This feeling came around I would say at least a year ago and I kind of thought that it would pass as everyone does go through periods in their life were they feel low however it seems to have stayed and feels like a black cloud hanging over me which feels worse some days more then others I come from a very loving family and live with my Mother and Stepfather as well as my younger 3 half siblings I am very grateful for the luxuries I have in my life however there is so much going on within me some days I often wake up feeling very down for no reason at all feeling very worthless and lonely even though my family are very supportive and caring I couldn't ask for a better family. ampx200BI believe my mental health has worsened due to finding out through family members that my biological father has been diagnosed with cancer and I guess this has made me realise that life really is so short and for some reason it has caused me to question myself asking I wonder if this is cancer causing? or what if I also get cancer one day? almost as if I have some sort of health anxiety and this is becoming an everyday moment as a youngster my biological father was unable to be there for me and my mother due to his lack of love or care and the biggest blessing was my mother marrying again to a man who I can happily refer to as a real father also a very close family member to me who I once spent a lot of time with has recently tried numerous times to take their own life and being so distant from them for so long has not been a good feeling and has made me feel quite lonely as I am already an individual who does not really have true friends as I struggle to trust people there have been many times were I have been invited out by others and have had to make up excuses for reasons not to go. There have been times were I have contemplated taking my own life as the feeling of worthlessness and sadness was at its most high this feeling is very hard to explain and I am just looking for a bit of clarity on maybe why I am feeling this way or if others have experienced something similar I really would appreciate any help at all.To individuals at work and university and others I meet I am often commented on being a very outgoing individual with a lot of confidence however deep down I often feel as if inside I am a totally different person which really does make me wonder how I became to be like this. I feel as if I lack the routine I once had in my life before and some days waking up feels as if I am just going through the motions not long ago I would read everyday and would love to keep a journal to put my thoughts to paper I remember heading to the gym 5 times a week running twice a week being full of energy living life to the fullest appreciating each day with those around me where has the old me gone?. Often I have been told by others I am a very goodlooking individual and in playful ways people have said You love yourself don't you or you are so cocky as I very much take pride in my physical appearance and enjoy doing my best to look as good as I can the truth is recently I have been struggling everyday to keep a positive mindset and do the things I enjoy having to put a mask on everyday is a task which I have become very familiar with I just want to know if others have felt the same and I would really appreciate any help which can be given I don't want to give up I don't want to carry on feeling this way I want the suffering to end or at least made easier. ampx200BThank you for taking the time to read this I apologise for any grammatical mistakes it is quite late in the night right now. ,Anxiety

34706,Just had the worst panic attack Was at my moms for dinner. Had a plate in the kitchen when I all of a sudden didnt feel too great kinda faint. Tried to walk it off and got dizzy tunnel vision sweaty and heart rate was through the roof. Seriously felt like I was about to die so I told my mother and wife.

34707,Im so tired of it all but I cant stop thinking something is wrong with me. Ive never had health anxiety but Ive been blessed with plenty of other types. Lately HA seems to be my primary form.Back in August I visited the ER for 104 degree fever that affected my vision in October urgent care sent me to the ER for an uncharacteristic migraine. In November I started getting chest pain which sent me to the ER several times out of fear. After numerous EKGs blood tests a stress test and event monitor setup Im told Im fine but have some PVCs. Im still getting the chest pains palpitations and headaches and multiple doctors ranging from primary care to ER to neurologists to cardiologists all attribute it to stress. Last year my blood pressure used to be 12173 when visiting the doctor but lately its skyrocketed to 15088 in the office. Taking it at home I average about 12876 but I can see my pulse go up when I take it.Im so scared about a multitude of things happening to me and I cant stop thinking about the unknown. I dont know if Im really okay or if theres something wrong with me with the constant headaches and other symptoms.How do people deal with this?,Anxiety

34710,Cant function properly due to fear of MS A few years ago I was involved in a serious car accident and developed quite severe anxiety. Shortly after this I started experiencing numbness and tingling down my left side went to the GP thinking it was MS and was basically laughed out of the surgery. Went to a walk in centre and was told it was anxiety. Over the years Ive occasionally gotten numbness tingling in my left side. Sometimes the left side seems weaker but its subjective not objective. Recently someone I knew from high school was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Since then Ive experienced loads of tingles and numbness in my left arm hand and foot. Im terrified its MS and have spent a lot of time in bed over the past few days researching MS crying and doing neurological tests on myself over and over. Im convinced I have it and my life is over. I just moved somewhere near and havent registered with a GP yet so its going to take a few weeks to get an appointment. ,Anxiety

I should be looking forward I should be looking to tackle the year head on and look to fulfil my potential. This time next year as we approach 2020 I want to be living my life to the full and not feel crippled by how my mental health perceives my physical health. I am so scared of dying that I dont spend anytime living. And that is a travesty that I must fight against. ,Anxiety
34712,mole anxiety Hi. i'm glad to have come across this group because nobody understands my anxiety. Since having children my anxiety has become really bad. I fear I'm not going to be around for my children. I've had a fear scares too and I have some chronic health problems. I'm on holiday now and noticed a mole was raised and a pink. I don't know how long it's been that way. I can't see a doctor for a few more days either. I scratched it a few weeks ago and the top of it came off and now the scab is sort of a shiny pink underneath. The mole seems to have been there for a year or so but not before that I did look at previous photos of myself. It's grown in size and changed to pinkish tinged. I am so nervous. I keep imagining that i'll die from this because I read that some pink melanomas can be life threatening in 6 weeks or so. It's awful. I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old so it's even more devastating. My husband doesn't understand. ,Anxiety

About two weeks ago it seemed to have a little white head and I popped it. Just like a tiny little zit. It does seems smaller and less red but theres still this tiny darker dot right next to it. WHY IS IT STILL THERE???? Ugh and I have to convince my parents somehow. I wish I was an adult where this would have been solved in a week in October. Im 16 just to throw that out there. ,Anxiety

34717,Health anxiety when sick Hi everyone I've had issues with GAD for the past 10 years it's something I've learned a lot from and managing it usually is not terrible difficult. In late November I came down with a cold which in turn became a sinus infection. I've had seminoticeable issues with my sinuses for the past two years but nothing crazy mainly decreased sense of smell and having a stuffy nose. During this time I became paranoid of various fatal diseases I had a ton of different symptoms some that can be related to sinus stuff some anxiety things. I've had a few ups and downs throughout the last month and a bit at one point having almost a full week anxiety free. Anyways do you guys have any recommendations for dealing with HA when you have an actual medical thing going on with it's own symptoms? I am currently paranoid about some kind of Bacterial Meningitis which while being rational is kind of a ridiculous fear. Going to the doctor is also a bit of a challenge I can't get a GP in my city In Canada and have to use health clinics. I haven't had any of the super thorough scans tests etc. Which also makes me a little paranoid even though I know it's recommended not to go down that rabbit hole. I feel like my mind gets incredibly caught up in that minuscule chance that it's something serious and my ignoring it is going to be the nail in the coffin. I also just wanted to mention that I know this is a positive experience for me even though it's kind of miserable. I don't want to be overly negative as I have had my good days during all of this and I try to keep positive even when things seem incredibly bleak and dreary. ,Anxiety
34718,Brutal bowel movements after eating and random constant burning sensation in chest all day no matter what Hi all just wondering if anyone else has dealt with this my health anxiety is improving no more panic attacks googling has gone way down but my stomach just wont seem to improve and this burning in my chest right between the collar bones seems to be completely random. I don't feel particularly anxious I cant even recognize it right now just kinda deflated to be honest but I know my thoughts remain on my health just way less intense than they were. I Don't really enjoy eating because I know whats in store for me and have gone from 187lbs to 164lbs. I had an endoscopy that they said was clear I'll most likely need to have a colonoscopy doctor said and going to see a lung specialist soon. If that stuff comes up clear which it probably will any advice how you help ease your stomach? Worst part is my diet is way better than it was so like should shrug I'm thinking of taking CBD oil but iono at this point just lost.

I went to the bathroom and when i wiped and put the toilet paper in the toilet i noticed a little bit of red on it like blood. i thought i was getting my period but i wasnt. i didnt see any blood after that. so now I am worried that it was someone ELSES blood on the toilet paper and am concerned about being infected with HIV now. Ugh. my biggest fear. The reason I worry is because one person who was at the party is a gay male and I am unsure of his status.. what if he was sabatoging the toilet paper with his blood?!I HATE THIS ANXIETY!

34723,I am just glad I have found you I have been struggling with severe health anxiety for the last six months. In the past year my life has been turned upsidedown I was bullied on my workplace I moved to the UK from Italy and my parents divorced. And although I am living with the most wonderful man I have ever met and I am finally doing what I love in a city I adore I feel completely BROKEN. Every night I go to bed thinking about the fact that a tragedy is meant to happen sooner than I could imagine and that a terrible unnamed illness will take me away from the love of my life and from my dream of becoming a museum curator. Every day I make an effort to get up and I immediately start checking my breasts and my neck for lumps. I feel exhausted. I only wish I could be able to enjoy a pleasant evening at the restaurant without a cruel voice inside my brain whispering that my happiness is not meant to last. I do not want to live like this anymore. I am 27 I have the holy right to be happy and healthy and to enjoy my life. This is so unfair.I wanted to thank you guys for putting into words all the things I constantly feel deep inside my chest. You made me understand that I am not alone in this.

Ive poked and prodded at it so much trying to feel around for any abnormalities such as a lump that now it hurts more from all the poking. Im not exactly sure what it is that Im afraid I have this time since Im trying so hard not to google anything and besides appendicitis I am not sure what other malicious causes could explain this sort of abdominal pain.

34729,Not sure if I'm having health anxiety or if there's something seriously wrong with me and doctors won't listen I've been growing more and more anxious and I stumbled across this subreddit through related searches. Basically I keep getting the sense that I'm not well off if you will or that there's something worse wrong with me than all of the doctors I've seen are making it out to be. And just to be clear I haven't gone to the doctor about random things that turn out to be nothingit's always for streplike symptoms colds or throat infections. I've had three in the past two or three months doctors just say maybe you need your tonsils out or might be a carrier for strep but at the same time I've lost around 10 pounds... I thought this was over the course of the summer but looking at my last medical visits I've gone from 135 Feb 2018 to 130 Oct 2018 which is normal weight fluctuation for me but then from 130 to 125 Nov 2018 and then my most recent visit Jan 2019 for my third throat infection my weight was 121 pounds. I'm a 5'4 woman and I keep telling the doctors about my concerns different doctors too but none of them seem really concerned. Is this normal?? They suggested maybe I was eating better which might be true but I really haven't consciously changed my eating habits and idk if I'm eating more or less than usual because I've never thought about it that hard... Can anyone help me?? Should I chill out?? Should I see another doctor and what would I say to get them to take me seriously? This is causing me a lot of stress and I feel okayish but I'm uncomfortable with the amount of weight loss I'm experiencing and it only seems to be getting worse.,Anxiety
34730,Cant do this anymore. As the title says I really cant do this anymore living with anxiety and health anxiety isnt even living its basically existing. Its got to the point that its changing who I am as a person Ive become jealous of people for being able to just live their lives I feel like Im becoming a bad mum and partner through it and Ive decided its time for a change. Instead of going to the doctor for yet more tablets Ive decided to overcome it myself eating better sleeping better avoiding alcohol Ive realised this does not help at all it helps while Im drinking and then the next day is hell avoiding caffeine and exercising and reading more. Ive started playing the sims on my phone just to keep my mind active and on something other than my health or whatever strange worry my mind decides to have that day. Ive decided enough is enough and Im going to push myself to do things I would never usually do and get better. Sorry for the moaning boring post but sometimes it feels good to get it out to people who actually know how you feel and wont just say youll be alright Also a great app Ive found is called Dare its absolutely brilliant for panic attacks and has really helped me the last few days.

I felt fine for a week after seeing her im not really feeling any sharp pains like i was but now I'm feeling dull aches at the base of my skull and behind my eyes its seriously scaring me so much I literally cried last night because I'm scared it's a brain tumor or aneurysm I want to go back to the doctors and get an MRI so bad I hate this so much im constantly scared I'm gonna die at 21.,Anxiety

34734,Lumps appearing overnight. So I dont post much on reddit but recently Ive starting to see more and more lumps appearing on my body. First was back in November on the lower left section of my abdomen. Two weeks ago two appeared near the last rip of my rips cage one on each side. I went to the doctor yesterday and she said theyre most likely cyst and to not worry about them. Although ts might just be me being paranoid but I swear more grew over night.

34736,Blood test results Hi all. Little backstory. I recently went to my doctor for some chest pains I have been having. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder since I was roughly 19. These chest pains have always been an on and off thing with me I've had scans out the wazoodle and also blood work over the years that has shown nothing.Today my doctors receptionist called me to inform me my most recent blood work results were in I had the blood work done roughly 3 weeks ago. This is terrifying to me as they have never called me before in results to blood work results.My mind is pacing thinking they found something horrible as it was not discussed over the phone I have an appointment tomorrow morning to go over the results with the doctor. My mind is going nuts thinking I have cancer or diabetes or something very life threatening has been found.I dunno I just needed to write this down makes me feel a little better in a way.,Anxiety
34737,Coping methods you use? venting I was finally approved and am able to afford health care and I scheduled an appointment for the GP and the Dentist because of a small bump I have sort of underin front of my ear by my lower jaw on the right side.But I am sort of terrified and am obviously fearing the worst I just wanted to know what coping methods you have. Bleh. I'm sorry I need to vent a little too. I've always had one tonsil larger than the other on the right side too and I like freaked out about it when I was 15 or 16 but it never grew or anything. I've had jaw pain on and off for a few years I think mostly when my wisdom teeth started growing in. I also get earaches tinnitus and jaw popping again mostly on my right side. I know this sounds like tmj but now I found this bump and I am just terrified the bump has been something more sinister and I could never afford to do anything about it and I am just ashamed of myself. Also like I need to get work done on my teeth and I am just a mess. I am happy I got insurance finally so I can see a doctor and maybe a therapist tbh. Bleh. I'm sorry if this is triggering for you guys I am in such a bad place mentally at the moment and I feel incredibly alone. It's gotten to the point where I kind of wonder why I am here sometimes. Like trying to be positive is so difficult. I try but it never sticks and I don't know how I got here. I am so sorry if this is triggering at all to anyone. If anyone has any coping skills or ways to distract yourself that would be incredibly helpful. I'm already doing the don't google your symptoms while I wait for my dr. appointment which is on the Feb. 1. So anything you got let me know.ampx200B,Anxiety

34739,weight loss I feel I should mention I've always been underweight with a high metabolism. I was recently sick last week with bronchitis which made me lose my appetite and since I've healed I also have stppped smoking weed. My eating habits are coming back but one thing that is concerning me is over the course of that week and a half I have lost 67 pounds.

34741,My story of chronic chest pain and health anxiety Six weeks ago I M26 was keeled over in bed clutching my chest. I felt a pain on my left side that felt deep and biting. It subsided shortly but since then I had what felt like a mass in my chest. Im not newcomer to chest pain either. Last year I was diagnosed with having PVCs preventricular contractions which are benign but ended up requiring me to get a Halter monitor and Echo. Those results indicated my heart was fine. Now however I was panicked thinking I might have a respiratory problem. I started googling lung cancer symptoms bone cancer symptoms the whole nine yards. One night I had a full blown panic attack thinking I was going to die from what felt like a huge tumor growing in my chest. And that damn pain never went away I paid attention to the tightness I felt in my chest all the time it was inescapable. While at times I would be distracted and not notice it a large portion of my day is spent studying and during those times of quite my mind would be drawn to the tightness I was feeling. I should also mention Im in medical school so learning all of the pathologies that could happen to a person made anything I felt be drawn to the worst diseases Ive since come to learn. It was only last week that I actually discovered this subreddit and I became sure my chest pain was related to anxiety. The anxiety of school the anxiety of my chest pain and the anxiety I had regarding my own mortality after a recent friend passed away. And what made it worse was that all of these things were acting as a positive feedback loop. For example Id stress about an exam which would provoke my chest pain which would make me more anxious which lead to worse chest pain and on and on. Maddening. Even though I knew how incredible rare it would be for a young nonsmoker to be diagnosed with a disease like lung cancer it was always where my mind went. In order to rule out actually having a physiological problem I got an Xray done today and it came back negative for anything. Though I question if that was the right thing to do. I dont want to be a hypochondriac and get needless and expensive tests done. And in some ways I felt like I gave in to my emotions. However Id be lying if I said I wasnt much more relaxed knowing that my problem stems from anxiety and not pathology. I write this only to say that chest pain is scary but more often not a lifethreatening ordeal. I hope to calm those who come here freaking out about a symptom similar to mine. And while I still have the pain I now understand it and accept it. Our bodies are weird and no one has the same body as you or will experience the same symptoms as you. My body likes to give me chest pains which are sometimes chronic sometimes short sometimes after a tough exercise. But after having run the gamut of tests Im actually just fine. TLDR Chest pain turned out to be nothing but anxiety after extensive testing. Youre fine. ,Anxiety
34742,Heart Palpitations StoppedEmpty Feeling hello everybody! i've been dealing with cardiophobia for 2 months now ever since i went to the ER for a fast heartrate that wouldn't stop. everything is fine with my heart i've had loads of EKGs chest xrays and bloodwork done. the month following however i could always feel my heartbeat in my chest. i would often put my hand on my chest to feel it beat to calm me down. i got put on anxiety meds and now my heartbeat isn't palpitating like it was in fact i only feel my heartbeat in my wrist pulse now. it's fine i guess that's normal but ever since it's stopped i've had this empty feeling in my chest. it's probably psychological but it makes me nervous sometimes that i can't feel anything there. thanks for listening to me if anybody else has any wisdom or similar experiences I'd love to hear it!,Anxiety

Anyway my latest worries are that I seem to feel like I'm struggling for breath at times and having random heart palpitations.This is one of those situations where as a sufferer of health anxiety your brain puts you on the spot and you have to make a decision. Do youA write it off as anxiety and try your best to get on with life.B jump to a conclusion that you are probably dying and seek medical advise.Guess what I did. After the doctor listened to my heart and lungs and said it sounds fine but we'll Do some blood work as I hadn't had any in a while and an ECG just to be sure. So I spent all Christmas worrying that I'm dying of a serious lung or heart problem and today the day finally came for the blood test and ECG. Now even the thought of blood work makes me feel sick. I layed on the bed and had the ECG done and when it came to the blood test she stuck the needle in and I had a panic attack and she couldn't get the blood from me. I am so embarrassed and ashamed of myself I can't remember feeling any lower. I tried to hard and iv been worrying about this whole thing for quite a while.Now I'm convinced I'm gonna get a phone call saying to immediately come in because I have a serious condition.

34753,Worried about my gallbladder how to stay calm until my next ultrasound. Quick background I've had health anxiety since my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer and it's gone through the roof in the year amp a half since she died.A year ago my doctor discovered a small polyp on my gallbladder. It was only 3mm but he decided to monitor it anyway just in case which means an ultrasound every 6 months for 2 years. During my second ultrasound the polyp was a little bigger this time 4mm and my doctor seemed worried. But he seems like he gets worried easily so I don't really know how I should feel... My mom's gallbladder was removed for a variety of reasons at 45 and it turned out hers had precancerous cells cells that look a bit off and may develop into cancer. So my family history has me worried. I'm also concerned because a it's a single polyp and single polyps are more likely to be cancerous and b it's growing albeit slowly.I keep trying to tell myself that I'm young midtwenties and that gallbladder cancer is EXTREMELY unlikely in anyone under 40 but I can't shrug this awful feeling. Gallbladder cancer kills 85 of people within 5 years though most people are diagnosed latestage so who knows what my odds would be if I actually had it.My next ultrasound is in a few weeks and my anxiety levels are ridiculous. How do you guys find some peace when you have a test coming up? ,Anxiety

I had awful diarrhea couldn't swallow drink eat no appetite was naseuas had chest pains and had very high heart rates. Over this period I got 3 blood tests a stool sample 2 abdominal CTs where you could see a bit of my chest and a chest xray. Nothing came back positive. Eventually I started feeling better and started going on with my life. What may be somewhat important information is that my dad is a surgeon and I work reception for him he had similar problems a few weeks before me.For the last few days I've had some looseish stools a bit of weaknessfatigue but mainly I'm concerned about a dull pain that moves around my chest. Today it's mostly been on my left side and about 30 min ago went into my left shoulder. Its not constant and it can be lower right upper left whatever. I'm terrified I have a pulmonary embolism or some sort of clot. I know I'm probably panicking for no reason and I hate annoying my dad with this stuff and he makes me feel crazy which doesn't help.

34758,Terrified of catching the flu after ENT visit. I've been a huge germaphobe for as long as I can remember. In the spring and summer it usually doesn't cause me to much distress but once cold and flu season pick up it starts to have a greater impact on my mental health and my ability to function. Earlier today I had my biyearly appointment with my ENT to get my ears cleaned out I produce a ton of wax. I was super anxious going into the appointment as there is a very bad cold going around my area right now and the flu is widespread. I took hand sanitizer with me and was prepared to grab a mask if the waiting room was busy. Thankfully there wasnt a single patient in the waiting room. I was called back quickly the nurse took some info I sanitized my hands and then my ENT entered the room. He shook my hand and then sanitized his and got to work cleaning me out. Once he finished I asked a quick question about how to avoid facial and ear pain on a long flight and he suggested the vasalva maneuver. He demonstrated it for me and then asked me to try it. Ordinarily I dont touch my face under any circumstances but since I had just sanitized my hands and since I was just pinching the outside of my nose I was careful not to get too close to my nostrils I figured it would be okay. So I pinched my nose very briefly and went on my way. On the drive home I started to think about it a bit more and realized that after I sanitized my hands I shook his hand so my hands probably were not very clean when I pinched my nose shut. And I started to get really worried that in doing so I probably exposed myself to tons of coldflu germs that will infect me in the coming days. Now I'm anxious as can be trying to find some rational reason why I shouldn't be worried here so I can calm down a bit. I havent had any luck yet. Can anybody help me out here? Also just for the record I'm seeing a therapist twice a week to help with these things. We just started back in October but unfortunately he's been out of town all of December for the holidays. I've backtracked a good bit in his absence. I'm also more anxious than usual about getting sick because I have a vacation coming up next week and I really dont want to have a coldflu while traveling. ,Anxiety

34763,A stranger touched my face last night. Very upset and scared. Went to a gay bar yesterday with friends at about 4am last night around closing time. My friends kind of separated from me trying to pursue a bartender. I sat at the bar looking at my phone when another person who was there started talking to me. I didnt mind at first but then I noticed he was drunk. I being horrible at small talk decided to compliment his teeth. I SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS because he then complimented mine and grabbed my face in an effort to open my mouth to see my teeth. Luckily he didnt get his fingers on or in my mouth but his hands were all over my lower jaw. I struggled to remove his hands off of me and then that asshole pushed me away. This person was a male probably in his mid 50s. On top of feeling like my personal space was totally violated I have been worried sick about any germs or viruses that could have been on his hands. I have not been at peace since it happened last night. I tried to talk to my friends about it but they were too drunk to care.,Anxiety
34764,Pilonidal cyst not responding to anti biotics ugh. I've had this thing for a while but when it flares up its never THAT bad. This time it was pretty painful and didn't go away after 2 days like it usually does. I went to the dermatologist he gave me anti biotics. Its been 2 days with the anti biotics ciprofloxacin and its still inflamed arguably worse than ever. Ibuprofen helps but not enough. Sleeping is so god damn difficult. The dermatologist said that these things can go 'deep' which scared the shit out of me. I've let this thing just sort of stay there for years now and I am terrified that a surgery would basically take a huge chunk of the entire area out just to get rid of this thing. I actually had a surgery for it years ago but that was when it FIRST appeared and that was bad enough. I hate this so fucking much.

34766,Should I be concerned about stomach cancer? Im a 24 year old male. 2 years ago I started having symptoms described below and it would come and go every couple months. So about 2 months ago I started having stomach issues with gas being constantly full zero appetite and little pains in my stomach. The pains faded after 2 weeks and the last 2 months it feels as if my stomach isnt producing enough acid. I dont know what is going on. I have zero pain during or after eating. The only symptom I have is the feeling of my food not being digested after eating and being full for hours and hours after eating. I have ZERO appetite. And also after eating my gut gets very gurgle and makes lots of noises.Ill even workout twice a day and fast till dinner and still have zero appetite. I usually consume 400600 mg of caffeine wether its multiple cups of coffee tea or pre workout so I dont know if that is bad. My anxiety has been very high worrying about stomach cancer.Anyone have any idea what this could be? Is it the caffeine? Does caffeine ruin your stomach? Is this cancer or chronic gastritis? Should be be concerned? ,Anxiety
34767,Acid Reflux Attack Interested in other people's experiences of PanicAnxiety attack.Does anyone else get an attack of acid reflux when they are in a panic? My wife tends to get a lot of foamy sputum coming up when she's getting a full bore attack which appears to be due to saliva mixed with stomach acid. This she feels hinders her breathing and it's only once she's cleared it does things start to settle but as with all health anxiety she's still concerned this is due to something else.This is all very new to her at this level at least had it low level for years. Still trying to get to grips with what symptoms are actually her anxiety attack.,Anxiety
34768,Blood Pressure This is for anyone with high blood pressure or blood pressure anxiety. In the past year I've gained some weight and become a lot more sedentary. My bp about 2 months ago was around 13082. The past few weeks I've been experiencing some pressure in my ears and throbbing eardrum. I visited my doctor and my BP reading was first 15095 and before I left 14589. She wants me to log my blood pressure and return it to her after about two weeks. What I'm curious about is to be diagnosed with high blood pressure does it have to stay elevated above 12080 all the time or if it gets up to higher than 12080 often it's considered high blood pressure? How exactly is high bp diagnosed? Is this something can kill me soon or is it a risk for the future? I'm a 27m a little overweight. ,Anxiety
34769,Four days of pure hell Today I decided I was tired of feeling like I was in mental prison. I have been not doing a lot because I feared I was dying after going to the dentist and feeling on and off fatigue for the last 4 days. I think I made it worse by thinking non stop negative thoughts. I literally poisoned myself with my thoughts. My lovely boyfriend came over the other day happy to see me and I was trying my hardest to hide my state of panic and fear from him. I couldnt even enjoy my time with him... I think Im okay today. This morning I was like fuck this and just got ready. Im hoping today I feel better. I might have had slight fatigue but my mind turned it into 100 worse then it was .... ,Anxiety
34770,Unclean tap water fear I was in the Philippines last January and I remember drinking tap water connected to a filter. Since Philippines is a third world country of course it's not going to be 100 clean. Surprisingly I have not gotten sick from drinking the filtered tap water. I'm scared there might be an amoeba hiding inside of my body right now ready to attack me. ,Anxiety
34771,Wtf is going on in my head? Normally I'm good at handling this but I really need reassurance tonight. I rolled over in bed and accidentally strained the right side of my neck a bit too much. I immediately felt discomfort and started to get a dull pain shooting up my neck and into my head all on the right half. My face felt numbish and now feels... not swollen but I guess 'puffy' is the best way to describe it? I have a dull headache on the right side of my head. Totally freaking out. Should I be worried or am I losing it over a simple muscle strain? ,Anxiety

34773,Does anyone else have pelvic floor pain after multiple ejaculations in a short period of time. Lately I masturbated two times in a short period of time within about 1 hour I guess after the first ejaculation I had no pain in my lower area. But after the second time I had a little bit of pain in my pelvic floor area for about 3045 minutes. As far as I remember this happend to me when I usually was younger Im 21 now as well when I masturbated a lot in a short period of time but since I had no HA back then I didnt stress about it. I just wanted to know if this happens to any of you guys as well and if it is normal.,Anxiety

34775,Helping Twin Brother Deal With Health Anxiety My twin brother 23 m has been suffering an extended episode of anxiety for about a month regarding terminal illness and neurodegenerative diseases. Two years ago he needed to have surgery for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome which was a major anxietycauser. Long story short his arm swelled up and he needed to be taken to the hospital learned he had blood clots in his lungs and spent the rest of the year on blood thinners to prepare for his first major surgery. Since then he's been extremely wary of any aches and pains he feels. This December his arm started hurting and he got an infected salivary gland. That combined with it being around the two year anniversary of his surgery triggered major anxiety symptoms. Since then he's had aches and pains tingling fatigue headaches all proportional to the level of anxiety he feels at the moment.He recognizes this too. He knows that anxiety something we have been officially diagnosed with combined with the hypersensitivity that comes from being on the Autism spectrum is the most logical explanation for his symptoms. But there's always that doubt and that causes more anxiety. According to the anxious part of his brain he's had MS some kind of cancer or some obscure disease that he read about on Wikipedia at some point. We have no family history of cancer MS or any weird diseases and we live extremely healthy lifestyles. He even went to his doctor to see what they thought. His blood pressure is perfect and a blood test came back with the only problem being a Vitamin D deficiency. His therapist has assured him that everything he's feeling is textbook anxiety. Despite this he still gets panicky about every little twinge he feels. It's making him to lose sleep causing him to feel tired and fatigued during the day and giving him more anxiety. It's a selfsustaining cycle.Him describing what it's like to be in the middle of an attack I feel like I'm dying and no one believes me.Now I suffer from health anxiety myself but for different reasons. I hate catching colds because they're basically a constant sensory overload for me. Besides that I've had existential crises and a bout of Alice In Wonderland Syndrome yes really but all of these things are or were made far worse by my anxiety about them. I've been able to get through to my brother by talking about my own experience but that only seems to work temporarily.I'm looking for advice Does anyone here have family members with health anxiety? If so how do you help them? Has anything worked for you? I hate seeing my brother deal with this and I just want to do what I can to help.ampx200BOh and don't hesitate to ask for more details or clarification on anything!,Anxiety

34777,Weird symptom I've been having that scares me. So for the past year I've been having this weird symptom on and off and it freaks me out every time. It only happens when I get out of the shower. My toes will turn noticeably bright red while the rest of my foot remains regular skin color. When this happens they are also very hot when you touch them. There's no pain numbness or tingling Just extremely red. Normally it only happens when I get out of the shower but I got off the couch tonight and it happened. I've done a lot of research on the possibilities and the most common answer is peripheral artery disease and that terrifies me. I suppose I'm just looking for some insight at the moment. I'm a 28 year old male quite lean. My family has a very good medical history but my father has hypertension. He's not overweight at all it's more of a genetic condition than acquired. I've never been diagnosed with hypertension but I wouldn't doubt if I have it or develop it at some point. ,Anxiety

34779,A person with health anxiety did the 23 and me health test and doesnt know how to deal with the results. Hi everyone. I am a 20 year old female. Long story short I watched my grandpa who has been my father figure all of my life die of a heart attack suddenly after years of going to the cardiologist for monthly checkups being told he was fine. Since then Ive had debilitating anxiety which has mostly caused me to be a serious hypochondriac. You name it I thought I had it. Ive been through all the typical anxiety symptoms that have caused me to go to countless doctors getting brain scans blood tests etc. Ive never checked out therapy due to always going to medical doctors. When they cant find anything I dont trust them I fear them from what they did to my grandpa. I stay up at night thinking about how they didnt find something that is seriously wrong with me like the cardiologist couldnt find my grandpas heart attack before he died from it. I have such a fear of death its probably insane. My main question here is this I got a 23 and me kit with the ancestry health for Christmas like most people! I was never worried about Parkinsons since it was never talked about on my moms side of the family. I dont know my dad personally I only know of him. I knew he was Italian which matched to what my reading was saying but I never knew anything else. I had 2 variants detected in my health report. One major variant detected for Parkinsons the GBA gene and one variant for Gauchers disease meaning Im a carrier. When I say I was shocked I mean I was shocked. My mother never mentioned anything about Parkinsons on either of my sides. I linked my results up with my moms results she also had the test and she also has a variant detected for Gauchers disease she gave it to me Im guessing but she doesnt have one for Parkinsons only I do. The more research I do the more I want to cry. From what Ive been reading I understand that I am at a high risk for Parkinsons from my gene being a GBA and having Gauchers. I see that I am at risk for early Parkinsons the one that causes the most cognitive decline very early in life. I have health anxiety to begin with yes I know I probably shouldnt have done the test but I really was never expecting THIS. I dont know where to go from here or what to think. I dont know what I should do. All my research through various websites scientific journals and forums are telling me about what high of a risk I have for early Parkinsons. I cant sleep at night after finding this information. My heath anxiety has been through the roof. How serious is this? Please no judgement. ,Anxiety
34780,Rabies fear Hello everyone back again this time with a rabies scare.I got a new cat about 3 months ago and she's a community stray from kind of the outskirts of Philadelphia. She's about 9 months old now and very rambunctious and quite a cutie.However as she is rambunctious I somehow started looking into whether or not she could have rabies. She runs around like crazy rolls around a lot and loves biting me. Like LOVES biting me. Definitely drawn blood a few times no infections due to careful cleaning after. I read that rabies usually shows 23 months after infection and upwards of a year so theoretically if she was bitten before I got her she's 100 an indoor cat now she could start showing symptoms. Is it at all possible or am I being a doof?Also should mention got her all of her shots after taking her in. Not sure if that matters for rabies.Thank you all!,Anxiety
34781,Why does my vision go black for a split second?? For a while now my vision has been doing this thing where I go blind for a millisecond a few times in a row almost like Im blinking without actually blinking. My blood pressure is fine I dont get dizzy I dont have anxiety when it happens it just randomly happens. I can be doing anything and all of the sudden its like someone turned the lights in a room off and back on real quick. Its strange. Is this something to worry about? Any help would be great. ,Anxiety
34782,Pulse Palpitations in Neck Hey guysI just wanted to ask around if any of you have this going on as well. For the first time in my life and only two days ago I realized that I can see the veinsartery in my neck visibly pulsate. I have had problems in the past with palpitations but now that I have noticed this I cant go in front of a mirror without freaking out about it. Is this something new or has this always been there and I just never noticed? There isnt much information about this online not that I want to search and freak out some more.What do you guys think is this normal male anatomy?,Anxiety
34783,Anxietips. Or not really. Just a story of my anxiety and how im not taking shit from it anymore Eight years ago i was diagnosed with chronic anxiety. That time i shrugged it off thinking hey this is normal right? Everyone gets anxious sometimes. This will go away right? Wrong. Here i am eight years later cringing at past me for even thinking that anxiety goes away like a seasonal flu.I spent some time going through therapy sessions and while those helped they didnt really cure me of my anxiety because for people like me anxiety is everpresent an annoying unwanted companion i am eternally cuffed with.I struggled battling anxiety for a long time. It was hard to be a fullyfunctional human when every speedbump looked like a giant boulder in the middle of the road. Instead of looking for ways around it my focus was on the speedbumpboulder and how impossible it was to conquer it. Anxiety paralyzed me and made me feel like i was always bound to fail.The smallest tasks would sometimes trigger anxiety and panic. I would cross the road planning my funeral because what if the bus hits me? I would get invited to parties and yes i craved to socialize but i would bail because what if i spill the drink and make a mess of myself? Public speaking was the worst subject ever because that triggered so much whatifs. I was sweating with just the thought of mispronouncing words and forgetting my lines. There were days when i thought i was perfectly fine then i would be attacked by constant panic and pressure that took away my ability to function and i would shut myself in because anxiety was crippling that way.I quit a lot of things in my life school jobs relationships some i didnt even get to start all because i worried i wasnt good enough. I was scared of taking a course i wanted because what if i couldnt find a job after i graduated? I couldnt take these programs because what if i fail them and i had to retake them? I resigned from my teaching job because i feared no one would take my subjects the following year that i might not be a good enough instructor. I was scared to build relationships and would stop talking to people i really liked or wanted to be friends with because what if they dont understand me?Because that was what i felt that no one understood me. I craved validation and support but instead some of the people i cared about left me for being overdramatic and a crybaby only because they didnt understand what i was going through. Well same. How could i blame them when i myself couldnt understand it?After years of battling anxiety i got fed up with it and i internally told it to fuck off. It didnt. But i knew i had to do something about it or else i wouldnt be able to really live. I knew that there was only so much i could do to help myself. So i did. I read selfhelp books which if i would be honest really didnt help that much because they all say the same things i already knew still good reminders though. I started reaching out to my fellow anxious people and asked for advice because you know it takes one to know one and they were the best people to talk to if i wanted to really get myself. Little by little i gained confidence about who i was and what i was capable of. It took years and a lot of hard work but i learned so much and i couldnt be any more thankful to the people who helped me and made me feel a little better about myself.Fast forward to a few years later. I cant say that i dont get anxious anymore. After all anxiety is already a big chunk of who i am. Maybe i just learned a few tricks to manage it somehow. Or maybe it just doesnt scare me as much as it did before.The fact is there is no onesizefitsall approach in managing anxiety. Some people fight their anxiety. Some people try to ignore it. If it works for you then it must be for you. But if there's one thing i realized for myself it's that fighting my anxiety is a losing battle so i embrace it instead. I take a break. I breathe. I ground myself to my surroundings. This way i know that i have control of the environment im in. I recognize the situation and try as much as possible to think logically. I acknowledge the facts and while i cant really do anything about my emotions i talk about the situation to the people who care to listen. If im alone i express what upsets me through writing. I walk. I go for a run. Not to try to escape the situation but to shake off the excess nerves. I look back to what makes me anxious and assess what i can do about it. If i need to take a break and feel the emotions as they happen i allow myself a few hours or maybe a few days to let it run its course. I think to myself it will pass. It always does.To my fellow anxious people you got this. It is a hard road and you may sometimes feel alone but youre not. Be kind to yourselves. If you need to cry do it. If you need to rest take as much break as you need. If it's too much to bear alone seek help.To everyone else anxiety thrives in a person's inability to take control of a situation. When someone feels lost it is important that they feel secured heard and validated. This is why it is important to show kindness and compassion to everyone.Disclaimer Im not saying that people should ditch therapy like i did. It just didnt work for me but im sure it helps others. Please please gocontinue going to therapy if you feel that it helps.,Anxiety
34784,A dip in my neck not sure what it came from I have had this weird crater sunken circle about the size of a quarter right where my jaw meets my neck for about a month. I'm 28 not super active but not overweight. 5'3 126lbs... i guess i'm wondering what it is because it didnt just gradually get there and i've never been hugely overweight so I don't know how likely it is to have loose skin there at my age weight?

34785,Thinking about lung cancer Long story short since like 57 hours I've been thinking about having lung cancer. The reasons why my brain suggest me this are chest or left breast pain but actually it's not very intensive.

34790,Rabies HA is wrecking me Hey all. So I've been struggling with HA for years now but was really doing a lot better almost 3 months with no major scares or full on panic attacks or anything. Then a couple days ago I got hit like a ton of bricks. I haven't been able to focus on or accomplish anything for days now and could really use some perspective.About three months ago I was bitten on the leg by a small dog while out on a run. It was a small bite barely broke the skin and it turned out to be my neighbor's dog. She was very understanding and even emailed me the dog's vaccination records. I also checked in last week and the dog is still alive and well.Despite this I started getting symptoms the other day and I cannot. Stop. Freaking. Out. I keep convincing myself I'm getting pain or tingling near the bite site plus I have all my usual anxiety symptoms again nausea insomnia loss of appetite brain fog which are all signs of rabies onset. I've done all the research I know there's basically no chance of getting rabies from an animal that's still alive weeks later but nothing will put my mind at ease. I can't shake the feeling that I should have gone to the doctor and gotten shots and now I'm going to die in agony for it. Has anyone else dealt with this? Is there anything I can do to navigate the anxiety surrounding this particularly horrifying disease?,Anxiety
34791,Exhaustion Can health anxiety cause fatigue? My anxiety has been so bad lately and for the past weeks Ive been exhausted. Im just tired throughout majority of the day.

Im only 19 and Im so tired of all of this. ,Anxiety

I don't think she goes to the doctor unless something is super wrong but I'm worried she has a brain tumor because she forgot some things I told her. She is also a bit over weight and i was reading that women who are overweight have a higher risk of cancer. I usually see her once a year since I live so far away and it feels like when I see her she is so much older... And this week I was worried I have colon cancer. I think it's because I ate a bunch of chick peas and so my stomach hurt. I can't stop my mind racing and thinking the worst. ,Anxiety

Another loose watery poop. As of this post my throat is still dry mouth is okay regardless of the water I drank today. I took PeptoBismol if that helps.

34795,My generic eye pain is totally an eyeeating parasite right? Woke up this morning around 4am to my eye burning like hell my eye was pouring tears and super sensitive to light my vision was blurred and my eyelids felt like they were coated in glass.I got pissed thinking I maybe had pink eye. Waited until 8am to go in to the doctor. By the time I did this all that was left was a vague shred of soreness and light sensitivity no more redness or crying. Doctor couldn't figure out what was wrong.Cue my anxiety.She put me on antibiotic eye drops and told me to go to an ophthalmologist if it gets worse. Fast forward to this evening. The burning is back. Not as bad as before but it's dull and present.And now I'm freaking out. Hyperventilating sobbing posting to reddit. Sounds dumb I know. But I'm fucking terrified. My vision is everything to me and eye problems freak me out more than anything in the entire world. I keep thinking back to some stupid show I saw where someone contracted acanthamoeba and I'm running through the symptoms nonstop. This guy got it by wearing contacts in the shower? SHIT! I did that three times last week! His eye felt like a foreign object was in it! OH FUCK! ME TOO!I know that the symptoms for just about every eye problem include red itchy burning but I'm so fixated on this worst case scenario I'm making myself sick.I'll take a thousand nightmares of pregnancy scares and infections that'll kill me over this one. It honestly feels like my life is ending ha.Anyway I'm not claiming that I have this but I've mentally convinced myself that I do. Anyone able to talk some sense into me?,Anxiety
34796,My worry of the week... Ive been experiencing pain in my left shoulder for about a week. I do have an old injury on it and I sleep on that side mainly. On Friday the pain was so bad it had me in the ER twice. The last time with a shot of Demerol and a heavy duty muscle relaxer.Ive been drugged up most of the weekend and for the most part the intense pain is gone but whats left is a weak arm and numbness in my elbow and most of the fingers on my left hand. I see my doc tomorrow.Its likely a pinched nerve or tendinitis. The ER doc said my muscles were tight and the pain was intense spasms Im talking worse than childbirthIve had two kids. Of course MY brain goes to worst case scenario like cancer and my body is riddled with tumours. The last couple days Ive had what I think is heartburn and intermittent chest pain which just fuels my cancer worry. Seriously its ridiculous. Im trying to practice the CBT Ive learned and steer my thoughts in another direction but its exhausting. Im exhausted. ,Anxiety
34797,Anyone else have a 'weird feeling' on the left side of their body? Like a sort of 'fullness' or that something is wrong. I've pretty much experienced this since I was an adolescent I'm 21 now. So basically on the left side of my body specifically the left breast there is sometimes a benign feeling of 'fullness' and less commonly a dull sort of pain. It doesn't really radiate. Sometimes when it happens and flares up I feel it the most when I breathe deeply in and out. I do have precordial catch syndrome which is harmless but I don't think that's what this is. I'm always convincing myself that it's angina and that I might have a heart attack but then I remember I've had this feeling for so long in my life that I probably should have gotten one by now. Even when I was young I had an EKG done and everything came back just fine and a cardiologist I saw was totally convinced that nothing is wrong with me and just sent me on my way. I'm so sick of having this feeling and I don't know what to think of it. And just recently I've started to have weird sensations on the left side of my left hand and sometimes below my left breast. There is also a point in my left breast that when I touch and rub it actually hurts. I'm thinking this may be a muscle strain or tear but those things don't really last for several years no?To note this feeling isn't constant it comes and goes. Even when I forget about it bam it just comes out of nowhere.I have no other symptoms. Zero breathing problems no heartburn etc.,Anxiety
34798,Why do I keep creating problems in my head to get freaked out about? I've had this IRRATIONAL above and beyond fear of skin cancer for like a year and a half now. I've had several moles from the littlest freckle to big moles I've always had that I obsess and get super paranoid about. I'm on mole 8 to freak out about. Part of this is because I still get a small molefreckle I'm 23 and I get super paranoid about getting a new one even though my derm tells me that this is normal. I just went to my derm about 3 weeks ago for my annual there was a spot on my shoulder I was freaked about ended being a black head she checked all my other moles and said all was good. NOW I'm onto two other spots that I am irrationally losing my mind about. I'm going to see my therapist a week from today so hopefully it will help. I just don't want to deal with this anymore. I'm terrified of everything. ,Anxiety

I was supposed to have a blood test but I had a panic attack but I had an ECG done and have heard nothing back so I'm guessing it came back OK? I'm still getting random palpitations and a racing heart that seems to come and go and I'm so terrified I have something seriously wrong with me.

34800,THIS is why I hate doctors... Ive found there are two different types of health anxiety. 1. You seek out medical advice for any and all issues or 2. You avoid doctors and tests like the plague because youre scared of bad results. I am 2. 7 years ago when I was 22 I had an OBGYN who badly needed clients bring me in 4x in a month unnecessarily to test me for slightly abnormal results on various things. She told me I could have everything from kidney failure to cervical cancer and kept running test after test. Every visit she thought I was something else. I had no symptoms this all started with amy first annual exam with her. I freaked out so bad that my parents were concerned about my mental wellbeing. I went to my family GP back home who talked me off a cliff and retested me for everything. I was fine. Fast forward 7 years. Im now pregnant. I havent been to an OBGYN since that first doctor and am terrified. I was recommended a new OBGYN who was supposed to be really great. I go. I submit routine bloodwork which was super scary for me due to previous experience. I get a call from new OBGYN telling me I tested positive for Hepatitis C that it is chronic and incurable and questioned about IV drug use. I run back in for follow up tests to tell me how bad I have it.Follow up tests show that I do not in fact have Hepatitis C at all. Doctor had failed to tell me the false positive rate is up to 50. Oh and per other doctors it is curable if I even did have it. There are commercials on TV about said cure for crying out loud!Yall I cant take this s anymore. I face my worst fear that I have a serious medical condition Im unaware of then Im told theyve found an underlying condition that could kill me and then they TAKE IT ALL BACK.I trust one doctor and one doctor only. Thats my GP and God help me when he retires. ,Anxiety
34801,Weird rash Ugh. I've been really good about my health anxiety lately but now I get random rashes. I showed my doctor pictures of them last month and he said they were vascular rashes and to just call and make an appointment if they happen again. I made an appointment for today but I'm nervous. They're such weird rashes. I thought they were something with my cycle because the last two times I got them it was while I was on my period. But I got it again today and I'm not on my period so idk what's going on. I went to the allergist a few months ago and don't have food or environmental allergies so idk what else there is. ,Anxiety

34803,Piece of advice take it how you will. Been suffering bad HA for almost 2 years now couldnt go get my haircut go out to eat with friends but recently it seems to be getting better Im not even sure if its actually getting better but Im living with it better. And thats the 1 piece of advice i wanted to try and give you guys instead of trying to end the anxietypanic just let it happen way easier said than done takes awhile to learn how but once i stopped getting angry at the anxiety and just allowed it to happen i swear it got better. I can go out with friends now and i know the anxiety and panic wont kill me its such a freeing feeling. Trust me i know what youre going through and it DOES get better. Love yall ,Anxiety

34805,Worried about Fitbit resting rate So I have been doing really well and going to the gym most days of the week and doing cardio since the week before the New Year. Thats all great except Fitbit is giving me resting heart rates that are really low compared to what Im used to. Like I had been 6465 and now its telling me 59! Its been steadily dropping since I started exercising can exercise change your resting heart rate that much that fast? Any insight appreciated! ,Anxiety
34806,High heart rate I had trouble sleeping last week I was very sleep deprived but I managed to get back to my normal sleep schedule again since Friday. The problem is I now have a fast heart rate of 90 all day even when resting. I was lying on my bed trying to sleep and then sat down to measure it and it gave me readings as high as 107 bpm and as low as 91. Im worried this will deteriorate my health and give me heart issues. My normal heart rate is in the 75s and below. I wanna see my doctor but I feel he is already tired of me and I feel like I might be wasting his time.,Anxiety
34807,Pain and consciousnessattention I haven't talked to a doctor about this because I hardly know how to describe it. Just wondering if anyone knows what I'm talking about.Sometimes when I get a sudden brief twinge of pain it feels like my consciousness shifts. Not like I'm dizzy or faint or anything but sort of like my train of thought just stops and my attention is immediately focused. It's almost a woosh feeling. It doesn't happen every time I feel pain just sometimes.Is this normal? Weird? Maybe related to blood pressure? I have no idea.,Anxiety

34809,Dealing with it I have been dealing with HA for the past 2years. It is nice to realize I am not alone in my struggles. Currently have a rough bout with getting over the thought that I may have lung cancer. I am a nonsmoker but I constantly am checking my phlegm to see if there is a little bit of blood. I do find very little bits some time but I am sure this is because of my obsessive checking. Been to doctor and had an xray but these always seem like bandaids as the feeling comes back after weeks. I have been to a therapist and tried doing CBT but I find that my HA can quickly snowball if I do not nip it in the bud early on. Kind of where I feel I am at right now. Its hard on my family and wife. She can tell when I am obsessing and if I talk to her she gets frustrated. Cant say I blame her I am pretty frustrated with myself. Dont know what I am expecting from this post but its nice to be able to just put down some thoughts some where and get them off my chest. I do wonder if my experience echos those of others here feel free to message me if you would like to chat. ,Anxiety
34810,I had no idea so many people were like me. Ever since I was 1516 I had panic attacks from thinking I was having a stroke or heart attacks or cancer etc. First was walking home from school started feeling very thirsty and hot then dizzy called 911 thinking I was dying having a heat stroke. Doc told me I had a panic attack. Now I'm 25 and been in and out of work due to my panic attacks or just the anxiety of having panic attacks. Im super depressed and have no drive to be the best me anymore. I feel stuck and like I'll never get better. Pot works wonders but unfortunately I don't live in a legal state. And since I'm looking for a job I can't use it I have to rely on my clonopin which only helps if I catch the panic attack in time. I get pains or find something wrong on my body and assume the worst instantly and go full panic mode. Fucking sucks. It's ruined my life all I do now is put in job applications and play BFV to keep my mind off my body. Last income I've had was from a guy I used to work concrete construction with who hires me as a ranch hand ever so often but only for about a week a year. My father supports me but I hate relying on him because he barely makes any money doing what he does and we are always short on food because rent and utilities come first. I hate doing this to him. I'm fucking 25 I should be out doing my own think not seizuring out thinking I'm dying 24 times a week. ,Anxiety
34811,anybody elses muscles go numb for a split second? sometimes when i laugh or let out gas my muscles go numb for a split second then go back to normal. I just wanted to know if anybody else has this experience because with health anxiety this terrifies me. The numbness is usually near my armpits and shoulders but it still terrifies me. ,Anxiety
34812,I think my HA is back I was doing well with my HA for the past year.From my post history you can see I had a small episode in December I had a loss of feeling in my foot that lasted almost all month but I managed to stay chill my friends freaked out more than I did and that made me question if I am too chill but overall I had no panic attacks or sleepless nights or anything. I went to a doctor after it lasted over 10 days and was sure it's just my back. I was prescribed some medicine for two weeks and got better can feel my leg again. My doctor did schedule MRI for my back just to check why it happened and since I have a sedentary job and have had minor back pain here and there I was happy with that. MRI is next week. Now this will get graphic. What is freaking me out right now is my bowel movements. I noticed that my BMs are a bit weird in August I would get more constipated from time to time feeling an incomplete evacuation from time to time and I started to need to go more frequent sometimes up to 45 times per day usually I'd go 12 times per day. Since I was on my let's beat HA kick I wrote it off to probably not eating as well as I should or maybe it's stress. I had no pain or other issues and I had good BMs as well. Those symptoms did not go away I got used to needing to go more often got used to mild constipation mixed with occasional diarrhea but a month ago I noticed that I often would feel like I need to go but all that would come out would be a few thin pieces. And 1015 minutes later I would feel like I need to go again. Then every 34 days I will get one somewhat bigger normalish BM and would feel better empty for one day then the cycle starts again. So for the last few months and especially last month I've had the following symptoms Change in the character or frequency of bowel movements Thin ribbonlike stools A sensation of incomplete evacuation after a bowel movement almost all the time now persistent urge to have a bowel movement also almost all the time Feeling back pain could be unrelated but it is low back pain Lately lots of mucus Lots of gas Occasional rectal pain Very occasional blood maybe once per two weeks or lessMy diet hasn't changed I eat plenty of fiber I don't eat meat or dairy. I know that as a 29yearold I should not be worried about colon cancer. I know my HA probably has made it something it's not. But I think what is freaking me out is not having a positive story for this. Like for my leg I could tell myself it might be sciatic nerve chill when my chest hurts I know it's probably GERD etc. But I don't have a nonthreatening explanation for these symptoms so I can feel my HA levels rising. Part of me is still clinging to this might be something else you're fine but part of is you know what these symptoms mean don't you. I know that these symptoms are enough to go to a doctor especially based on how long they have been there. Actually I might have been stupid by not going to a doctor sooner. But I already have back MRI scheduled and I've been through so many bouts of HA I know that as soon as my doctor will say something like let's get a colonoscopy I won't be able to sleep or eat at all. I don't really know what's the point of this post since nobody can tell me what's wrong or what this could be we're not doctors here and I should talk to mine. I guess I just needed to let it all out and know I am not alone and it fucking sucks to get HA back after a year of normal living. ampx200B,Anxiety

34818,HA Person's Worst Nightmare But I'm Coping A little about me I'm vegan fit try to avoid processed foods chemicals only have monogamous relationships never had a 1 night stand etc. I have had health anxiety since I was 19 when I worked in an ER and saw all the terrible things that happen to people. So this past weekend I went to a college reunion with people I hadn't seen in 7 years. We went out one night and a friend asked if I smoked I said no. He handed me his vape and said try this. I did and hit it a few more times through out the night. Well at the end of the reunion weekend he revealed to a friend that he had been HIV for several years and currently has his virus controlled and undetectable. But needless to say it was a very stressful drive home. I had one of the worst HA freak outs I have had in years and didn't eat for 48 hours I was so nervous. I could hardly get out of bed!Thankfully I have been reassured that HIV is not passed via saliva even though I've what if'ed the hell out of the situation. Of course I will still test to confirm but I learned so much about HIV in particular through this experience which has helped mitigate my anxiety. ,Anxiety

34823,I got an aneurysm and i'm still alive I feel the need to add a trigger warning to this post. As someone who suffers from HA I know this post can be scary but if I can be positive about it you all can! I was diagnosed with brain aneurysm and artery dissections when I was 22 which put me at stroke risk until I was fully healed which I am now. I will post the full story in the comments.It seems that for some of you on here that is literally your worst fear I'm here to tell you that even if it does happen an aneurysm or even a stroke is not a death sentence. In fact I was healed with no surgery within 3 months. The aneurysm had been there for at least 2 months before that and I had no idea AND I STILL LIVED! The most debilitating part of this? The HA I got from it. It was the darkest 6 months of my life. I was in constant fear of having a stroke despite the blood thinners I was on. I never wanted to be alone anywhere and only felt truly safe with my parents. I had panic attacks all the time. But slowly I gained more confidence in the functioning abilities of my body. I can honestly say that the HA affected me way more than the neurological symptoms did. So give your bodies more credit and your anxious brains less credit! If I can survive an aneurysm and torn artery and only have bits of HA after 2 years so can you!!,Anxiety

Turns out that I might actually have it myself. I hear a faint high frequency sound everytime I cover my ears with my hands and during complete silence. I always thought it was normal to hear this at times when nothing can be heard. I've had a panic attack since noticing it and noticing that it can't be cured. I'm still wondering if I have this and if my head is just making this up.. since I've never ever noticed this before. But I can't stop thinking about it and covering my ears to hear if its still there. I'm terrified and shaking.I'm so afraid that I will never be able to not hear this sound now when completely silent.

I was diagnosed with IBS four years ago. Ever since I have had different episodes of constipation and diarrhea and like such intense gas discomfort that I could feel the spasms in my intestines. I've had an ultrasound to give me peace of mind that my abdomen is clear of anything sketchy. About a week ago I had an outpatient procedure done and needed to take a high dose of antibiotics. 1000mg of aziththromycin. Well I have been so constipated and I mean my water intake hasn't been the best I have been super stressed out anxious overwhelmed my diet hasn't been great...it's been mostly in n out pizza etc...and yesterday I started feeling this weird pressureuncomfortable pain in my actual butt. Like the same muscles I use to pee operates that back there too I think and it feels just not great when I pee or sit down too hard etc. Has anyone ever felt this way? I've been able to pass a little bit of poo but not much.

I know you guys arent doctors and I am waiting for a call back from psychiatrists but I was wondering if any of you guys have had similar symptoms and could give me some insight.I feel like the way most people describe there anxiety is a lot different than how mine feels.ampx200BSometimes I just get these episode where everything gets scary. I just feel confused and very on edge and everything makes me jumpy. My life feels almost like a horror movie during these times. Usually a small sound such as my fridge PC anything really will seem to grow louder and seem eeriespooky. My thoughts go down this loop of Do I have some sort of serious chronic mental illness will I feel this way forever will it get worse? And of course I try to shut these thoughts down and sometimes can but the feelings are still there and very real. Sometimes I get very weird and super brief thoughts of doing rash things flipping the fuck out on my grandma for example. It feels like there's an anchor in my stomach and sometimes but not usually Ill get shaky and have heart palpitations. These episodes last for well over 15 minutes and I never feel normal afterwards so I get annoyed when people label them as simple panic attacks because they way other people describe there's I feel as though mine are a lot different. ampx200BAnother thing to add is over the summer I did acid for the first time and I always read that acid will onset any mental illness you are going to get in the future. So I often fear that I did acid and fucked myself over because of it but nobody on either side of the family has a history of schizophrenia or anything of the sort.ampx200BIf anyone could give me some insight or share what their crippling anxiety feels like I would love to hear it.

34844,I'm spiraling right now. What do you guys do. How do you cope with it. Just need a shoulder to lean on and a friend to talk to. Recently just moved to a new city for a new job and I am all by myself in my apartment. I don't have furniture yet and I am still sleeping in an air mattress right before I moved I had a muscle strain and the doctor prescribed me a short dose of prednisone. I started to get real bad side effects at the end of the course and my blood pressure is shot up. Went to the ER and was told not stress out and that it was just anxiety and the drug clearing my system. My intial BP when they took it was 18097 and thenback secs later dropped to 16393I was thirsty and urinating all the time. I was convinced I had diabetes and high blood pressure. All while moving to a new city amp new job. Then began experiencing really bad heart issues coupled high blood pressure. Tried to just relax but still stressing. Then yesterday had a blood in my nose all day which freaked me out so much. I stupidly kept picking at it with my finger to check throughout the day.

34846,I need help getting over my fear of diseases like ALS I am 27 years old and have had a morbid fear of certain diseases like ALS that will dominate my thoughts sometimes. I first started to really fear ALS after watching a movie on Lou Gehrig 10 years ago. Ive never known anyone personally who has ever had ALS. Every once in a while I will go through a period where I just think almost constantly about it. The reason why Im afraid of ALS is because its so terrible and as a white male who is decently athletic I am technically considered more at risk than other demographics. I know 4060 is when most people are diagnosed and I dont want to be thinking about ALS for the rest of my life.,Anxiety
34847,Something that is really really helping me get over my HA Hi guys I'm a longtime sufferer of panic attacks and my health anxiety had gotten out of control. A long time ago a psychiatrist told me to read a book called Hope and Help for Your Nerves by Claire Weekes. I did not read it back then but just recently picked it up. It's an old Australian book first published in 1969 but it has been EXTREMELY helpful for me. I'm also on medication and I can't recommend antidepressants for HA enough but give this book a try. It's only 8 bucks on Amazon so it's not a huge investment. I hope this post helps someone out there! ,Anxiety
34848,Humming feeling in right side of the chest Hey guys I'm in full on panic mode right now and I feel like shit because of it. As of yesterday I noticed some weird humming that happens a couple of times a day sort of like when you have the flu and hear that motorized breathing except there's no snot and I don't feel sick. At first I thought it was really a snot deep down but then I noticed it happened when I wasn't breathing meaning it's not even connected to that. Has anyone had anything similar happen to them? Lately my eye is twitching like crazy could it be connected to magnesium deficiency? Thanks,Anxiety
34849,I've never had an ulcer and can't remember the last time I had acid reflux. Upper stomach pain... brain says cancer logic says acid reflux or ulcer. Help? Mostly asking what an ulcer really feels like. I've never had one before as far as I know I'm 29 and have never been diagnosed with one. But then again because of insurance issues I've not really been able to see a doctor in like. Years. It's ridiculous. Long story. Anyway I'm hoping to get insurance and be able to at least be seen within the next few months. Until then though reassurance is kind of all I can get.I know what that sharp burning acid reflux feels like I used to get it sometimes in high school but generally I don't ever experience that. I honestly can't remember the last time I got that sickly burning acid reflux feeling. My diet's really bland out of preference mostly vegetarian some but not a lot of meat which I think contributes to a lot of my inexperience with acid reflux.I have pain in my upper abdomen right in the middle. I can't tell if I'm feeling it in my esophagus liver or upper stomach. It feels very close to the surface and hurts when I push on it. It doesn't really feel like the way acid does when it trickles up into the esophagus. The pain worsens when I have gas and eases up when that passes. It's dull and honestly easy enough to just work through but the fact that I've been having it almost every day for a couple of weeks now concerns me.Doesn't hurt to breathe. Just this dull ache ranging from annoying to actually kind of ouch but still not enough to vocalise about. Just concerning because it keeps happening.I used to drink a couple beers every night but now have since eliminated that to see if it makes a difference I can't tell if it helps. Feels the same as when I drank every night. Is it possible that this is just acid reflux and that it can feel different from the hot burning feeling in the heart area?Does this sound more like an ulcer?For what it's worth I think I'm in fairly good healthjust underweight 95lbs 5'4 Female with no family history of cancer but I recently learned I have a family history of gall bladder problems. Mildly sedentary activity levels work a desk job and tend to spend a lot of time writing at my computer while at home.Any advice to tide me over until insurance comes through would rock.

34852,Literally freaking out about basically nothing Ive been going pretty good not worrying about any health related things and feeling great until today at work and I had a bit of indigestion when I got to work because Ive changed my diet and drink the man shake every morning and this morning I drank it way to fast thus resulting in quite a bit of burning in my throat. About an hour later I got a shooting chest pain which I know would of been caused by the indigestion but whenever it happens I cant shake the feeling its something else. Then throughout the day I get these nose twitches and got a fuzzy feeling between my eyes which Im assuming is caused by the anxiety but thinking about it just gives me more anxiety. Big fun ,Anxiety
34853,This has become devastating. m24So. Ive always been a worrier. Worried about everything since I was little. Ive struggled with OCD and anxious thoughts for a long time. However it seems that since a ER visit in the summer Ive been super aware of aches and pains more than I have in the past. It had led me down a road of constant deliberations on my own health. I have dealt with chest pain lowerextremity pain and seemingly much more. December was a rough month for me. A lot of stress about jobs and life changes. However it seemed my health anxiety became insane. Heartburn ruined my Christmas. I have become so anxious. However I am seemingly now facing my biggest challenge yet. For about a week now possibly two. I have felt a small fluttering in my right abdomen. I have also been bloated and am constipated. I think its important to mention I am not the best eater. Missing meals not eating enough eating one large meal a day reliance on cereal. However I went to see the doctor and she had said it was constipation. She prescribed some glyencol and said to up my fiber and improve my diet. However my intestines in the last three days have begun to contract or spasm. Almost like waves reverberating inside me. Its not entirely stopping me from living but its simply awful to feel. So now I fear the worst. I just want to live my life. The saddest part about HA is the fear that something could be wrong. I just needed to vent. This subreddit has been helpful. Thank you. ,Anxiety
34854,How do you get past the physical symptoms? Currently sitting in the bathroom hiding from my kids and crying. Whenever I get panicky or anxious I always feel like Im going to pass outdie. It will feel like Im suffocating. Its like it will start from my feet and go to my head. Then I get that lovely impending doom feeling some serious derealization then its game over. I will freak out try to escape from wherever I am. They are so fun when youre driving I feel physically ill 247. Im talking weak legs arms nauseous brain fog really bad. I visited the doctor 6 times last year and also had 3 ER visits. Everything is always anxiety. Well today Im trying to catch up on housework my family got hit by a really bad bug sinus infections strep throat and I feel too weak to do anything! Im shaking right now. I dont know if I need to eat or something or Im about to keel over! My dr says I need medication at this point because I am completely agoraphobic. I notice every twinge within my body. Im feeling so helpless at this point I cant live like this anymore. Can you guys help me please? I know I need to help myself. Its just hard. ,Anxiety
34855,I am literally at my breaking point. I seriously dont know what to do or even where to begin with all of this. Please bear with me I know Im likely going to be all over the place. Ok for starters I am a 38 year old female with a pretty lengthy history of health anxiety regular anxiety if its anxiety related I probably suffer from it. I worry about EVERYTHING. Its as if I just get a simple thought in my head I have to run with it to the extreme. I have had every disease imaginable. MS multiple types of cancer the list could go on forever.... I see a psychiatric NP who has tried to put me on some different medication which I cannot take. Once I read the side effects forget it. All bets are off and I just suffer. I do take a low dose of Xanax which helps me in the midst of a really bad time but I havent taken anything long term. Ive seen therapists in the past and to be honest they were not that helpful. I assume just not the right fit or whatnot. Usually when my HA hits it will last for a couple of weeks or so and then I get over whatever my problem is at that time. Ill do ok for a while and then itll dawn on me that wow Ive been feeling pretty good lately! Thats when my brain is like here hold my beer. Then all fucking hell breaks loose... which leads me to today. Ive been having stomach issues for a while now. A variety of symptoms that are all over the place. I went to my GP who did bloodwork. According to them it was normal. I saw a gastroenterologist yesterday who isnt overly concerned but were doing an ultrasound and an endoscopy to just rule stuff out. Great. When I was at my GP appointment she asked me a bunch of questions. Blood in stool? No. Night sweats? No..... Wait after I thought about this I realized I DO get night sweats sometimes. Its not all the time but its definitely happened a handful of times that I can remember. Like pretty bad too. Of course I didnt tell her this because by the time I remembered I was long gone. What could night sweats possibly mean? Dont worry Dr. Google to the rescue. Lymphoma leukemia?! Wtf. Now Im losing my mind with worry. Next up. I have this weird hard area in my mouth. Looks like a mandibular tori. Of course Im freaking out about this too. I go to the dentist religiously and Im going to call them Monday morning just to make sure but in the meantime Im seriously losing it.Im so concerned about my mental health. I need help. The only good thing about any of this is... I took half a pill of the lexapro I was prescribed that has been sitting on my nightstand for the last 6 months. I know its not doing anything right now but I at least took it which is a huge step for me. All I can do is hope for peace and try to find a way to enjoy my life. I want to live! I am just debilitated and heated down by my anxiety. If it even is anxiety and not some terrible disease after all. Honestly I just want to know Im not alone in the way I feel. And I feel completely and utterly alone. Nobody understands. If you suffer from HA or my ridiculous story is at all relatable to you please by all means I would love to hear what you have to say. I just want to feel better. Thanks ,Anxiety
34856,How do get over mild hearing loss in right ear? I've been crying and depressed. I've had health anxiety for a long time but none of my fears have come true until now. It all started when I saw a video of tinnitus sufferers getting a temporary relief. I had no idea what tinnitus was so I googled it. Turns out I have a mild form of that and hearing things when it's quiet is not normal it's tinnitus. I was shocked since I've had that ALL my life. I remember hearing the sound of silence AKA the ringing in my ears since I was very young. I was really shocked and scared at that time since I never noticed this before. But that's not the peak of my misery. I read that tinnitus is often accompanied with hearing loss in any way. I then did countless online tests and always came back with the top score. However I found an app that makes an audiogram of separate ears and how much hearing loss you have in them. I got my results and they said I had mild hearing loss in my right ear in the midrange frequencies but not the higher ones. I didn't think much of it at first until I tried blocking each ear individually to see if there was any difference in hearing and now I can hear a magnificent difference. My right hear is more muffled when I block out my left ear and my left ear sounds perfect.How do I get over this? I got out of my depressive state around 6 months ago and have been doing so good since.. until I noticed all of this. I don't feel normal. I feel like I'm handicapped now and PERMANENTLY. This word is what makes all this so scary.. permanent. Means that I will NEVER hear normally in the right ear and this devastates me. Might devastate me more than the average person since I make music and music used to be a big part of my coping mechanism with depression. Please help how I can get over this I can't accept that I have hearing loss even though it's mild. I don't know what to do. I can't afford a counselor and I don't want to tell my parents about this. I feel suicidal.,Anxiety

I have a stretch mark literally right above it but this feels like its under the skin. I have to really search for it to find it.Im 18 and make if that helps I really just posted because if look up anything about a back hump it gives you things like a sarcoma or bone cancer or something I been feeling my back so constantly that its making it sore which just freaks me out more.

Recently I've been getting better and even managed to get myself into a relationahip which was great.The thing is two weeks ago I noticed that I seem to struggle with gettingkeeping erections. So I obviously started Googling which was not helpfulas always as it said its mostly thing old guys get and so on. What it did notice was a terrifying thing called Venous Leak which means your veins can't trap blood for erection there is no fix for that and you're doomed. So I started stressing over this so badly I wanted to know everything about it thing is out of all my health scares I never seen a condition so poorly reported there is very little information about it and no statistics and contradicting facts which is fueling my anxiety even more. So I'm sitting here worrying that surely I must have it and seeing it seems to be very unknown I definitely have it. Has anyone heard or knows more about this? ,Anxiety

34869,Booked a health test total regression HiI've experienced health anxiety on and off for most of my life. It has become a lot better over the years and I have found ways to cope and calm myself down. I'm not the HAtype that goes to doctors a lot actually almost never partly because my rational part knows that it's just HA and partly because it's so crazy expensive. My main tools for managing HA has been act normal even if I feel worried and obsess do not take action don't look for reassurance don't see a doctor don't google don't feed the monster setting a specific time when it's ok to worry between 67 at night worry time. At other times just postpone it. and writing down what I worry about. It's been going well for the last few years and I almost considered myself cured.Until I decided to go for an extensive health check with a battery of tests. There's no particular symptom that brought on this just that it's something I should start doing regularly at my age. What normal people do. However as soon as I booked the test and got the list of tests HA totally exploded. In a way worse than the usual HA where I used to focus on just a few illnesses now I basically convinced that with that many tests and possible cancers I must check positive for at least one! Has anyone else experience this kind of setback and how did you cope? I still have twothree more weeks before the results.,Anxiety
34870,Having a bit of a health scare right now could use some help making sure this doesn't spiral out of control. Hi everyone new here but could use some help.I am a 27 year old male. I have a history of health anxietyhypochondria and I also have an undiagnosed chronic inflammatory pain condition. I also have GERD and barrett's esophagus.I stopped taking the prilosec I was taking for my GERD and also haven't been to a doctor in about 4 or 5 years to get an endoscopy. For those of you who don't know Barrett's Esophagus is a precancerous condition. This is also where the concern comes in.I drink pretty heavily not everyday but definitely on weekends and I also smoke socially.Leading up to New Year's I started noticing that I could feel liquids going down into my stomach a little more than usual. This was a little alarming then my GERD started getting worse. Then I started having problems swallowing and then I completely lost my appetite. I've been struggling with appetite loss and swallowing problems for a couple weeks now.Now when you google the symptoms these are all common symptoms of Esophageal cancer. This is where the fun has begun. I don't know where the cycle started but I am thoroughly convinced I have cancer at this point. I've made a doctor's appointment to my primary and asked for a referral to a Gastroenterologist. Gastroenterologist office says they are reviewing my file so I can't make an appointment yet. This concerns me dont want to jump through hoops because part of my file is missing. In the meantime I'm just trying to get through the days. Super hungry but zero appetite so I've been forcing myself to eat which is awful. But I also feel like I've been worrying myself to death thinking it's cancer and spending time on my phone researching. What can I do? Tonight I was going to take a xanax turn my phone off and watch a movie to try and calm myself down but I didn't end up doing that. I just ended up looking at more esophageal cancer stuff. How do I stop worrying about this until I get my doctor appointments. It might be a month or two at this rate before I get an endoscopy! ,Anxiety

Its still the slightest bit asymmetrical from my right armpit but not like usual. Was it likely not even a lymph node then?

34874,hantavirus?!? hello fellow reddit people. i go over to my boyfriends every weekend and i think it was the 29th of december when i went to start packing i opened the dresser and seen that the mice chewed through some wood and shit everywhere. one shirt had a massive pile of crap and wood shavings on it and got all through my clothes. so i just started taking them all out except for the one shirt that had the most droppings. i havent open the closet till i needed a shirt tuesday put it on and forgot about the mice poop but i didnt think much of it. i got really bummed thinking about how pretty much all my clothes were destroyed with mice feces and urine ill admit i let them go for about a week. so last night i put gloves on and put all my clothes in trash bags. i threw away the shirt that had the main crap on it. then i started vacuuming out my drawers with a shirt tied around my neck cause i was scared to breathe it in. then of course i got online and started reading about the virus and began to go into panic mode. i read that if you vacuumed the poop up it can become airborne but i didnt worry about that until after i started overthinking. i slept two hours because i was so terrified that i was gonna die in my sleep. this morning i got so frightened with getting the hantavirus that i immediately went to the ER and they took my blood urine and an EKG. the tests came back fine turns out im just dehydrated. yet my anxiety still is causing me to freak out and constantly thing i have the virus. im scared to death literally. my anxiety is making me think also that they misdiagnosed me which happens a lot with this disease. my boyfriend and many people have reassured me that im okay and that i didnt get the virus yet idk if its my anxiety mimicking the symptoms of the virus or what but im very positive that i will be dead soon. i just need some opinions from strangers i guess?,Anxiety

I guess they could have been chasing each other on the curtain causing the rustling but who knows.ampx200BAnyway I went back to the bed and was facing away from the window with my hand resting behind my head when I felt a sharp sensation in one of my fingers. I looked around and couldn't see anything and there were no puncture wounds or marks on my hand.ampx200BLong story kinda short I've convinced myself that a rabid bat flew into my room snuck up on me nipped my finger and then ninja'ed itself away this despite there being no actual sighting of a bat or any wound.ampx200BI realise how irrational and ridiculous this all sounds but nonetheless the fear of dying from rabies is real and it's driving me a little nutty. ampx200BJust to mention that I don't live in a rabies hot spot the incidence of rabies in humans from bat bites in my country is very low and apparently fewer than 0.5 of the bat population is rabid.

34881,Anxiety or actually ill? So I don't know where to start this so I'm just gonna get to the point. I'm an otherwise healthy 20 yo female and last week my legs started feeling very itchy. Then the itching moved upwards to my torso and arms. On wednesday I noticed two strange rashes on my arms and decided to see a doctor because the itching was just horrible. He said it's probably an allergy and that he can't do much until i figure out at least if it's food or something enviromental causing the problem and he gave me allergy pills to ease my itching and rashes. He said to take two if the rashes reappear. So the next day when I got another one on my arm I took just one pill and they stopped appearing. The next day I took one more just to be sure and the itching and rashes were totally gone by friday. Now the problem is on friday I thought my breathing was a bit more labored than usual. It's probably all in my brain but the feeling hasn't gone away. If I put my mind to something else I'm fine but as soon as I start thinking about it I get panicky. It's been the same for 4 days now and I'm not sure what to do about it. Also on friday when I had lunch I ate very little until I started feeling very sick. The same on saturday and sunday. Is it all due to my anxiety? I'm nervous to see a doctor because I don't want him to think I'm making stuff up because I was just at his office a few days ago and now I'd show up with another problem. Helppp,Anxiety
34882,Squeezing feeling in my ribs Hey guys. Really glad I found this sub seems really helpful! Was just wondering if anybody experiences a similar symptom to what I have a lot of the time.Most of the time my body feels okay? Okay enough I guess. But once every 23 days I seem to get symptoms in and around my ribcage area. That entire section of my body suddenly feels very tense and it gives me added symptoms too. When I stand up I get more lightheaded my breathing because shallower by default my heart races and I sweat a ton. I also feel like there's a general squeezing action occuring around my ribcage. For example when I take certain breaths I can physically feel the tension in my rib area. Because this area is so close to my heart I worry that it is actually my heart malfunctioning. I hope that isn't the case and it's more to do with my ribcage area being tense or something.The weird thing is that most of the time when this symptom comes along I'm not even nervous. It just always seems to happen in the evening when I'm watching the TV or having just been for a walk.What makes it worse is that it doesn't leave either. The only way I can make it stop is by going to sleep and then my body 'resetting' to normal the next morning. Sex can help the issue but other times it makes it worse too. My body just feels full of adrenaline when the symptom start.So I was just wondering if anybody had anything similar? I just don't understand the source of it all. I'm rarely anxious mentally beforehand but it seems as if my body is anxious. It just comes on so randomly. The problem is that from there on the symptoms it gives me are so uncomfortable that I worry about it. It makes me wonder if I have a heart problem or something along those lines. Is it just all an internal anxiety attack built up from all of the tension my anxiety disorder in general gives me? Is it some sort of adrenaline problem? I don't know but I desperately want to solve it because it hinders my functionality so much. I just turn into a breathless tense mess when it hits me and it causes me so much distress. ,Anxiety

34884,To medicate or not to medicate? Hello friends. This is my first post here. Ive been admiring the confidence that you all have in sharing your concerns and stories. Thank you for your honesty. I have enjoyed learning from each interesting thing that you all have to say. I have been dealing with severe health anxiety for a little over 1 year now. The destruction it has done is devastating. I am entering into a new chapter in my life with many new important roles. Going back to school for my bachelors is one of them. I will need to be facetoface with many of my specific fears and phobias. Ive been considering starting medication for anxiety such as Buspar. This scares me. My health anxiety is thinking of all of the possible side effects. I am tempted to do this because I want relief. Counseling has only helped mildly. CBT has only helped mildly. I want to be normal again. Thoughts?,Anxiety

34888,Whooshing flowing in ears head anyone? Sometimes when I wake up in the morning especially if I wake up suddenly scared due to a loud noise or from a bad dream Ill jump up quick and I can kind of hear flowing in my left ear which I expect to be my blood flow or something. Im not sure if this is due to the sudden rush of blood or what after laying down all night. It totally scares me to death. It lasts maybe 20 seconds and goes away. This is the only time it happens. Ive brought it up to doctors and they dont really seem to say too much. Anyone else ever experienced this?,Anxiety
34889,Diabetes Anxiety Helloo everyone Im new here I could really use someones advice im kind of freaking out I havent been diagnosed with diabetes but Im really scared that I have it and I know the smartest thing to do is to make an appt with your doctor so I did but my doctor is out for a couple weeks so my appt isnt until feb. So a little about me I have been diagnosed with Anxiety and Im known to overreact but I cant get myself to calm down. Im always scared that I have diabetes because I am over weight Im like 5060 pounds overweight Im only 19 years old and I know I need to lose weight and get healthy its really hard for me and my weight is something that I really struggle with. So with that being said diabetes has always been in the back of my mind and some days it creeps up and takes over me and Im freaking out about it the whole day. Today is worse because I learned about something called DKA I dont know much about it but what I did read about it is making me scared usually when I have anxiety Ill take a nap or something now I dont even want to do that after reading something about it. Im not really always thirsty all the time I usually have to force myself to drink water. I sometimes feel like I pee a lot but I wake up when Im sleeping to pee except for when I wake up in the morning I always have to pee and before I go to bed I get up 23x to pee. Sometimes I feel like my feet and toes are tingly like if there falling asleep and then it will go away as for blurry vision my vision is bad to begin with Im also always on my phone which probably dosent help. I havent had any significant amount of weight loss if anything Ive gained more weight. I also keep watch when I get a scratch or a cut and I just had one on my leg about 2 weeks ago and it healed fine. Im also TIRED all the time I get super super tired sometimes I take a nap and sometimes I try to fight it out until the its time to sleep at night this could be because my sleep pattern is all over the place and Im currently trying to get it back on track but I dont know. I know I probably sound dumb and I know you guys cant diagnose me but maybe if someone could just help me out ease my mind or let let me know what they think I should probably get off the internet and relax but I cant always this was just what I am thinking right now so if something I said about anything in here is false regarding the symptoms or the whole DKA thing I do apologize also sorry for making this so long. ,Anxiety
34890,Worried to death about Lymphoma So a couple of weeks ago I started to get small short pains in my groin lympth node area. It will last for a few seconds and then go away.

34891,Muscle Weakness from Anxiety? Hello all! This is a wordy post but I really need some input on this.ampx200BI have a heaping helping of OCD and GAD. Since last summer I have been going through a huge amount of stress from changing medications and not yet having found the right combination all while working full time with ADHD. I also started taking blood pressure medication because that's just how my body responds to antidepressantsI have bad genes clearly.ampx200BTwo months ago I started having full body muscle weakness. I don't necessarily feel it all the time although I am a lot more prone to soreness now. But any time I try to do anything physical climbing stairs washing dishes actual exercise my muscles start getting fatigued and that burning sensation that comes with a lot of activity. I feel like I have about a third of the stamina I usually do and my baseline stamina isn't great and I'll feel like I've done a long workout after basically nothing. I have always had a tendency to muscle stiffness but never experienced anything like this. ampx200BMy doctor has run a bunch of tests and there's absolutely no medical reason she can find for this. This started a few weeks after I started a blood pressure medication that worked but my blood pressure is not low and she cannot find any electrolyte imbalanceanything else that might be caused by it. Neither my PCP nor psychiatrist have ever heard of a side effect like this for any of the medications I'm on.ampx200BSo my question is have any of you ever heard of or experienced muscle weakness like I'm describing as a side effect of stressanxiety? I definitely have had physical illnesses from anxiety before pain dizziness nausea but this is new. I wouldn't be surprised if this was from the stress of the past few months but I really can't say.

34892,Lump near groin between pubic area and inner thigh I'm kinda scared. I have a pea sized lump in that place you see when you open your legs where your legs move very close to the pubic region and the inner thigh. It's a hardish lump like cartilage. If i move the skin it moves with it do it's not stuck on the bone or tendon. I have a small red bump right next to it too which is kinda irritated but the big one is the one that freaks me out the most. When I fully open my legs you can see a bit of protrusion.

34894,Proud of Myself Hi everyone! It's been a while since I posted on this sub and I really wanted to share a small success story to hopefully help you if you need it.So this past summer I was active on here all the time. I was convinced I had a brain tumour bone cancer blood clots and a bunch of other issues. I ended up starting therapy in September and it's been going great! I've been able to stop immediately seeking reassurance i.e. going to the ER and dealing with my fear of death. I still struggle with googling and the initial worry of symptoms but I can honestly say I'm starting to get better.Anyways I feel like I had a major milestone today even if it doesn't really seem like that big of a deal. My health anxiety is mostly focused on myself but also extends to other people I care about like my family. So naturally when my mom told me she found a large lump on her breast while showering I panicked. Like full blown panic. I immediately thought the worst shocker especially because just two months ago she'd gotten called back for an abnormal mammogram and had to do a bunch of imaging tests to make sure it was nothing terrible. That week waiting for results was excruciating thankfully it was just benign cysts. Naturally this brought me back to that terrible week of worry and I was immediately thinking that despite 2 mammograms an ultrasound not even two full months ago that the doctors must have missed something and that she had a terrible disease.My initial instinct was to google I tend to seek out information in times of stress because it helps me feel like I have some control over the situation. I was so tempted to google incidence rates of breast cancer likelihood of breasts cyst vs. cancer and the like. I had intentions of reassuring myself but I also knew that doing that would only feed into my anxiety and make it worse. Despite how badly I wanted to do research I forced myself to ignore the compulsion. I was also able to rationalize and talk through my fears to come up with a logical conclusion i.e. family history of cystic breasts likelihood of cyst vs. cancerThankfully our family doctor believes that it's just a cyst that was seen on the mammogram but filled with fluid due to her upcoming period. He's sending her for an ultrasound to be safe but overall isn't worried.However despite all this I feel really proud of myself! I managed to avoid Googling because I knew it would harm me even if I was convinced it would help me. I really feel like I accomplished something and I hope that sharing this encourages any of you who need help to get it. Therapy has been a godsend for me even if it's just in small steps like this.,Anxiety
34895,Have you experienced death? Im just curious. I am a 30yo female and I have had anxiety and healthspecific anxiety since I was about 14. I attribute it to the fact that I have lost so many people in the last 30 years. I wont go into details as to not trigger any anxiety or panic. In a nut shell most of the death has been untimely and traumatic. I think it just manifested into anxiety for me. Anyone else have similar experiences? Oh and side note some of the deaths have been due to overdoses which has made taking medicine very anxiety provoking as well. Fun stuff. ,Anxiety

34900,My story of HIV anxiety Hi thereFor the last month and a half I've been dealing with the worst health anxiety of my life. Prior to this my health anxiety has been me thinking i'm going to have a heart attack causing me to constantly check my pulse. Things along those lines. But my current situation is far more severe. Here it is I've posted something on here before about it.I met a girl and we talked for months. She is a sexual person and I am not it took me months before I finally decided I could move past just talking. After sex with a condom the first few times we had unprotected sex the next a few times. I know how stupid this is but its even more idiotic for someone with health anxiety as i've learned. We agreed it was okay to do because i had no sexual history and she had been tested negative for stds. After the last time 2 weeks later i got very sick. My doctor called it the worst sore throat she had seen in a long time. Along with that came chills body aches fatigue. I had blood work done my doctor called to say I had mono. I had only kissed this one person and I asked her she said she had mono 4 years before. However I idiotically googled symptoms. As it turns out HIV in its early stages has all the symptoms of mono. Combine that with having unprotected sex 2 weeks before feeling sick and immediately I become overwhelmed with fear. I began to notice other things wrong with my body that resembled acute HIV my tongue has a coating on it that i think is oral thrush a rush formed on my chest after i started to feel better. Other things started to appear like my stomach began to growl regularly and my legs turn red in the shower. This fear hasn't gone away for a month now to the point of it keeping me up at night and sporadic panic attacks when I think about it throughout the day.I have to take a test to put this to rest and resolve it. I know how extremely unlikely it would be for me to have this. I asked if she had been tested for stds since and she said she had been very recently. On top of this im not sure i can ever be intimate or sexual again if this is how im going to act. ,Anxiety

34902,Some very helpful words to put things in perspective This is an article I found that makes me feel profoundly better every time I read it. I posted it as a comment a few weeks ago but I thought it might reachhelp more people as its own post. It seems relevant to some recent posts on this sub. I'll post the url in the comments but here it isWe all worry about our health from time to time at least to some degree but some people worry excessively about catastrophic consequences of seemingly benign symptoms. Theyre known as hypochondriacs.This is the sort of process hypochondriacs go through whats that? A benign lump or malignant bump on your face breast or rump? Adrenaline rush heart pumping sweating and lightheadedness follow confirming the gravity of the terminal selfdiagnosis.Thoughts racing and images of a foreshortened future orphaned children and opportunities missed. Overwhelming distress. Must plan the epitaph see I told you I was sick!Our future and physical health are inherently uncertain. But people with hypochondriasis immediately resolve any uncertainty about novel physical sensations and symptoms on the side of catastrophe.The body is constantly in a state of flux. The heart pumps blood flows muscles twitch lungs inflate and bowels contract. Strange symptoms come and go. And most pass without conscious awareness as we focus on daily tasks.But try this. Hold your hand upwards so that your palm and fingertips face the sky. Focus all your attention on the tips of your fingers and wait and wait until you notice some sensations. Tingling temperature changes or just an awareness of the sensations on your skin.Heres an even simpler task. As you read this shift your attention on to the sensations of the ground or chair pushing up against your body. Chances are you were unaware of all these sensations just moments ago.Attention you see is the microscope of the mind. It can filter in or out any of your internal or external experiences.Now imagine becoming hypervigilant to all the physical changes naturally occurring in your body. Try it. Just focus on all the sensations in your body for a minute. Amazing isnt it? Itchy toes tense jaw mild headache numbness and so on. All the normal workings of a healthy body.People with somatic symptom disorder are experts at searching for and noticing normal bodily changes. Theyre also experts at interpreting these in potentially catastrophic ways fatigue is leukemia a lump on the arm is cancer.The number one enemy of someone with the disorder is Dr Google cyberchondria. Indeed the only thing more catastrophically creative than a hypochondriacs mind is Googles 2.42 million webpages on the causes of cancer. Every possible symptom can be linked to every possible diagnosis by at least one disreputable source or another.The hypochondriac is searching not for information but for confirmation of their imminent demise. If theyre unlucky they might come across contradictory information or additional ailments they hadnt yet considered.Their intense worry and anxiety feel intolerable and must be neutralised. Seeking out a sympathetic doctor or other source of reassurance or avoiding the health section of the newspaper all provide temporary relief until the next physical symptom is perceived.So what are some things that keep hypochondriacs worrying?Belief worrying will help me catch something early.No it wont. Worrying will just keep you miserable until youre old enough to find out how you will shuffle off this mortal coil unless of course your demise is a blissfully brief surprise. Worry itself will not get you any closer to predicting preventing or planning for your death.Belief I can get certainty about my health.Nope cant get that either. No amount of checking doctor visits Googling reassuranceseeking will guarantee with 100 certainty that youre well. I can however guarantee that the unrelenting pursuit of certainty will make you miserable.So how can you manage health anxiety?First develop some healthy guidelines for monitoring your health and stick to them.Based on your past experience how long do benign symptoms typically last? One day two days one week? Decide how long you will wait before seeking any form of certainty or reassurance from the internet friends family or medical practitioners the next time you notice a symptom especially ones youve worried about in the past. Once this time expires no pun intended make a decision about whether you need to get the symptom checked or whether you can wait another little while before doing so. Follow guidelines from reputable sources about the recommended frequency of body checking.And be willing to sit with uncertainty about your health. None of us ever have certainty about our health. I could have a brain tumour as I write these words. I am willing to accept this possibility and shift my attention onto the next paragraph.Think about it this way if I offered you a 2 million insurance policy for your house even if I promised to build you a goldplated replacement if it were destroyed you would likely consider it far too expensive.So how much are you willing to pay to prevent any possibility of illness? Are you willing to give up your capacity to work time you would otherwise spend with friends and family and ultimately your happiness? This is a very high price to pay.Spend energy on things you truly value rather than wasting it on a false insurance policy. Learn to accept uncertainty about your health. Revel in not knowing when or how the end will come. Focus instead on the time between now and then.Ultimately what you have to decide is which epitaph you would prefer when your inevitable end arrives lived decades in misery and fear of death or didnt see that coming but my life was far richer for it.,Anxiety

34910,Swollen lymph node goes away as fast as it inflames Repost from AskDocsAs far as i remember this began this past summer. One of my armpits would get a painful feeling almost as if I pulled a muscle or so but no lump or anything. Then a couple of days later it would be painful and a lump and what I figure to be a lymph node. It's never more than 1 inflamed at a time under 1 armpit. It used to be just the left but this morning I woke up with one under my right. I would say the frequency is about 1 flare up every 2 to 4 weeks moreso on the side of a month. And no bigger than a pea or maybe MampM. I can't really tell since I touch it but sometimes the skin appears reddish underneath sometimes it doesn't. They eventually go down again and no pain and it feels fine. I don't ever have any symptoms of being sick as in cough fever chills etc. Everything is pretty normal beside the lymph node if it is that flaring up. So something more serious to worry about and go see my PC or just let it be? Could they be cysts that flare up and then go back down? It's not the same lump either the location changes too. I do have history of healthy anxiety my fear is lymphoma and i've been to the doc plenty of times this past year already and would rather not for something like this especially when it goes away.I should mention not sure if this matters but I had changed deodorants around the same time frame from deoantiperspirant to just a deodorant. Anyone got an idea?,Anxiety

34915,Feeling of trapped burpexcessive burpingNausea Hello all lately Ive been going through a scare as someone with IBS. Lately Ive been excessively burping. Even if I havent eaten anything yet and especially once I eat something. However the thing is sometimes I need to force the burp out because it feels like its trapped in my stomach or chest or throat. And when Im unable to get the burp out it makes me feel nauseous. For the past couple of days except yesterday Ive been either dry heaving or actually vomiting. When I vomit its either this clear liquid that tastes like acid which I assume is acid and sometimes its food I eat. Burping helps relieve the feeling for a few minutes but then its back. This has been happening for a couple of weeks already. But before I wasnt diagnosed with IBS. I had HA about colon cancer. Once I was told that it was IBS by my GI the burping never stopped but the nausea sort of did.Fast forward a little bit and I was fine. I was eating healthier and my bowel movements were even improving. I even went on a trip to Hawaii and I was fine there. I had one bout of nausea but thats it. And then shit hit the fan right when I got back from Hawaii. Basically whatever I said in the beginning lol. But heres a list of all my symptomsmedical issuesExcessive burpingfeeling like a burp is trapped in stomachchestthroatNausea due to reason aboveOccasional acid when I burp and in the morning when I wake up making me think its possibly GERD but I dont have heartburn and this feeling is only occasionaldry heavingvomiting clear liquidfood. No red blood or coffee grounds or green or yellow liquid.mild IBS no abdominal pain predominantly constipation although it has been getting better. Ive been having nice BM every day. But yesterday it was diarrhea which is weirdsometimes blood on the toilet paper but this always happens when I have to strain and it hurts and itches. GI says I have internal hemorrhoids.BM are usually 45 on the Bristol stool chartSwollen turbinate and a deviated septum ah my first bout of my HA. If I could go back in time I would prevent this lol.Fatiguesome skin patches that idk if its eczema or psoriasis. Leaning towards eczema since I have an intense family history of it.Ive had no weight loss thankfully. I actually gained weight in Hawaii haha. So its basically the burping nausea that is making my HA spike. And it sucks because it makes me anxious that I have some deadly colonstomach disease again and Ive considered making an appointment with my GI to see if I can get an endoscopycolonoscopy which he was very reluctant to do since Im 22 years old. This burping and nausea is just so annoying and depressing. I had to go home from work because of it. Ive been combating the vomiting well so far. Breathing sort of helps with nausea as well as chewing gum and ginger ale. However they havent been as effective as before. My mind is going through so many possibilities of what this could be hiatal hernia GERD postnasal drip from my nose problems a general IBS flare up a stomach ulcer my stupid anxiety or something worse. Its just so fucking scary. The only thing that makes me feel better is sleep. Please the best advice andor reassurance.,Anxiety
34916,Got a cold and fever worried that I got sepsis I've been having a cold for three days and had a fever coming and going for the last 2 days. I cough alot had headache before running nose and is freezingsweating alot. I'm alright at the moment but I'm worried that I got sepsis. ,Anxiety
34917,Muscle Twitch Around Knee Hey guys only just discovered this subreddit today amidst another day of google searches loved the Health Anxiety Starter Pack post!ampx200BI'm not sure what I'm asking for here more just a bit of adviseguidance I guess. I've always had some mild HA since my late teens and get abnormally anxious at the sign of any lump bump or anomaly on my body. Like a lot of others the illness that puts the fear of death in to me is ALSMND from the UK. I go through phases but over the past 6 or 7 years i've always tried to convince myself that i'm showing symptoms for it. However I'm 30 now and around 5 weeks ago I started to get a distinct muscle twitch just above my left knee like lower right of the thigh. It was fairly consistent clearly visible but painless. For context I work in fairly stressful sales job get a bit blue during ChristmasNew Year in any case and had a lot to drink over the Christmas period with numerous nights out etc. This seemed to compound the issue and really flare up my HA.ampx200BSince the turn of the year it's continued in the exact same location amp really seems to kick in when I pay attention to it. However when I play sports workout and find myself away from my own thoughts it doesn't seem to impact me as much. Recently it's started to impact my sleep and my work which is quite rare for me and very concerning. I've read in and around 200 google articles and I can't help but feel everyone of them can't discount the likes of MS amp ALS etc. I feel like the twitches have became a bit more regular but they're just as isolated. I've been to a physio they claimed it may be a circulation issue and basically battered my left thigh to help....it didn't. I've been to the docs and given blood they came back fine. I've got a follow up with her on the 25th and my plan is get a referral to a neurologist....although that scares the shit out of me. The doc did mention it was unlikely but to me that just translates to there's still a chance.ampx200BI've tried to convince myself that this is stress induced and i'm in a viscous struggle I'm trying to run more and improve times to prove to myself that my muscles aren't degrading amp are actually improving....although all this does is make runs far more stressful than they used to be! I've became a right pain in the arse at home and my negative outlook is having a bit of impact at home with my fiance also getting married this year. ampx200BAny guidance on how I should proceed with docsconsultants or any hints or tips to stem my worrying would be massively appreciated.ampx200BCheers,Anxiety
34918,CLEAR STUFF ON EYE This has happened to me a few times in the last couple of months but it went away. So I notice when I wake up my right eye feels like something is in it. Its very annoying it feels like a eyelash is stuck in it. I look and theres a clear string like gunk on the white part of my eye. I looked it up and I seems very similar to a cyst? Has anyone ever experience this?I have no health insurance so Im hoping it resolves on its own. ,Anxiety
34919,Scared about stool and stomach So for the past few weeks I've noticed that my stool is soft and sticky most of the time and when I wipe I notice tiny black dots in it but I can't see it when it's in the toilet. my stool also floats sometimes I'm scared I might have GI bleeding or pancreatitis or something. Like I said it's been like this for a few weeks but it does not seem to have gotten worse and I'm tired of going to the doctor for every little thing I think I have.,Anxiety
34920,At what age did your HA start? I have always been a bit uneasy about medical problems but didnt start feeling physical symptoms until about a week and a half ago. With no triggers or life circumstances to speak of my brain started telling me I need to take deeper breaths than I am capable of taking. The next day I hyperventilated so hard that my hands went numb and curled up tight. I am 24 and until recently I figured I had managed to evade young adult mental illness. Most people I know had it start at a much younger age. Any other late bloomers here?,Anxiety
34921,The grand old duke of hypochondria he had 10000 symptoms and when he was only half way dead he was suddenly fine again! Ever feel like every day is an uphill struggle? Youre master and commander of a rebellious army of terrible thoughts that you spend all day corralling into a manageable format only for them to break ranks out of the blue and leave you exhausted and all out of battle plans? You would concede surrender wave your white flag if you could. But when youre fighting yourself theres no one to give in to only a brief respite of broken sleep spinning the roulette wheel of anxiety will you wake up tomorrow with a new symptom or be granted a brief moment of peace? You pray for the latter and prepare for the former. Monday you wake up with nausea the stomach cancer is back again. But you also had abnormally painful cramps on your last period so the logical explanation is that these symptoms are linked. The ovarian cancer from November is back and spreading you were bloated last Friday too if all makes sense when you put the pieces together. Pace the floor a little as you wait for the toaster to pop. Will I make a coffee? Hmm the caffeine wont help the nausea. Just stick to water and down your multivitamins your antidepressants the liquid iron for the self diagnosed anaemia. Palms are sweating hands are jittery a headache is setting in. Oh god is this the blood pressure dropping or hypoglycaemia setting in? Only I could contract diabetes 15 minutes after learning of my terminal cancer diagnoses. The toaster pops makes me jump a mile heart racing. Better check my pulse... great a heart attack induced from the stress of my diabetes and cancer double blow. Dr google is ready to see you now.Nausea abdominal pain search What is this amateur hour? Ive been coming to this doctor for 15 years I know better than to be so vague with my symptoms. Better be more specific. Nausea shakiness headache sweating dry mouth....No no no. Ill just be told its anxiety again. Far better to type in what I know it is and confirm my hunch with the list of symptoms that comes up. For the 300th time in a decade you search for heart failure kidney infection four different types of cancer Parkinsons M.S stomach ulcers all the time internally scanning your body meticulously for developing symptoms... youre so good at this now that you can feel the tiniest disturbance in your body a twinge in your arm the blurry vision when you look at a particular angle in a certain direction is that a post nasal drip coming on? And the day speeds on leaving you in the dust an exhausted heap of worry and fear. The hours pass commitments left to the wayside as you forge on in the pursuit of truth about your terminal condition. Youre grumpy snappy why are people trying to talk to you when you are clearly on the cusp of finding out without doubt you have 6 days left to live? Typing away on your phone or laptop a partner or a parent curiously asking what you are up to are you on Facebook honey? You are short with them youre busy. Weighing up whether to tell them the truth youre dying again knowing you will be met with rolling eyes or a speech about how youre fine to stop worrying. So instead you keep quiet they think youre in another mood youre always so moody. The night draws in and youre done. Youve scoured the forums the articles the YouTube videos. You still feel like crap noticing youve a sore throat and swollen glands. Great HIV too.Until just before bed you do what you always do. Find the others like you wrap yourself in the thin fraying blanket of comfort that comes when you accept there are others all over the world who are dying today who receive new terminal diagnoses every other week those poor souls who receive crushing news of an incurable illness like most people receive spam email.Health anxiety. A seemingly uninstallable app rooted in your brain with new and exciting updates every day.Your foe your enemy your captor. Tuesday and Wednesday go off without a hitch you have no symptoms youre healthy for a couple days. Wednesday you caught norovirus from that person on the bus. Thursday it was gone but you woke up with Leukemia how you managed to trudge into work after that blow was a miracle. Friday you were cured Saturday the pinnacle of health Sunday the cancer was back. And so the cycle continues. Held captor to a cruel brain one with a tumour in it that is so over sensitive to every bodily function every twinge that in its effort to inform your of your terrible illness its slowly killing your soul day after day. Theres hope for us yet. Once I went a whole month without silently battling a terrible incurable disease. One day that will be a couple months then a year and Ill live like all the normal healthy people all around me. One day. ,Anxiety
34922,Stressing a little of medication side effect Hi! I've been having issues with constantly feeling like I need to pee and not emptying my bladder for a few months now although all medical tests have indicated there's nothing at least structurally wrong. I am a male. I was prescribed 0.4 mg Tamsulosin HCl aka Flomax which relaxes the muscles in the pelvic area and muscle tension and anxiety are suspected to be the cause. I read through the booklet I got with the medicine and I just have concerns about the fact that one of the side effects is retrograde ejaculation where semen enters the bladder instead of leaving the body...sorry for putting that image in everyone's heads. It itself is not a serious symptom and I know even if it does happen it will go away when I stop taking the medicine. I'm only taking it short term too. I guess basically does anyone else also get stressed out about side effects? Any mental tips on how to stop being so crazy about it? Of course I know rationally that my doctor decided the benefit much outweighs potential risks and that they always put every possible side effect because that's just legalese and what not. It's ridiculous because I know this medicine was given to me to HELP me! But this crazy irrational side of me can't just relax and take it.. ,Anxiety

34924,Can a lot of strenuous intense exercise after each other in a day cause heart damage? It was more than a week ago where my heartrate was high all day. For some reason I believe I damaged my heart without feeling any significant pain. This kind of thinking is fucking scary. It sends you right down the rabbit hole of anxiety. My heart was tested extensively almost a complete year ago and it turned out well.But then I rationalize that something bad happened and my perception of my beating heart becomes clearer and clearer and I feel it more and more.I don't know what to fucking do now. I am too lazy to go to a doctor again to test myself for the so manyth lt not a word time. But I have to.. Or not? Or do I.. I might die if I won't.. I'm fucking scared. Normal people won't go to the doctor when they feel nothing.. Or do they? What if my body is suffering in silence? Oh my fucking God. I cannot die.,Anxiety
34925,Have diverticulitis now anxiety? I was diagnosed with diverticulitis in September. Unfortunately the infection spread through a hernia in my groin area and I developed an abscess in my groin. I was hospitalized for ten days for treatment. Last time I had been to the hospital was at birth 38 years before so this was a shock. I wasn't treated poorly or anything just being away from my family from work from life seemed to get me down. I have a five year old and I face time'd with her while in the ER the first night and you could see the fear in her eyes. She had only been in the hospital prior to visit great aunts who would go on to pass away. The look on her face is seared in my head and basically impossible to shake. A fearful look because I'm sure she thought when I see people in the hospital I some times don't see them much longer after that.It was a bit of a tough recovery every ache spasm etc sent me into a panic. Feeling my groin to see if I could feel a bulge from a returning abscess. Pressing my lower abdomen to see if I was in pain from a recurrence of diverticulitis. Sleepless night staring at my phone on healthline or Mayo Clinic. Recently I started having this bubble sensation in the sternum area near my chest it would come out of nowhere and almost pop and be gone. No rapid heartbeat blood pressure normal but the more I worried the more they'd come along mostly all at night when my mind has more opportunity to wander. One night was so bad I did go to the ER they hooked me to an EKG did a chest xray blood tests. Nothing really no heart attack. Was home in bed within a few hours.My PCP suggested a holter monitor EKG which I wore for a day this week. No results yet as the doctor has been out but I'm guessing if it was anything truly pressing I'd have known by now. I think folks here understand my predicament and I just needed to say it out loud to someone other than my wife. She herself has had anxiety issues in the past and says it's probably a post traumatic anxiety.Are these types of sensations normal for those of you who might struggle with health related anxiety?ampx200Bampx200B,Anxiety

34927,How I overcame health anxiety read this is your currently struggling So i have been wanting to post this here but have been putting it off because this is going to be long so bare with me. If you want to know how I over came this bad disease keep reading If your ready to recover keep reading. It all started when I was 16. Nothing necessarily trigger this other then I got sick one time fever body aches and it had been a few years since I had a check up when my mom said you need to let me take you to the doctor for a check up because you wont know if somethings wrong of you dont. So when I got sick I decided to google it to see what was wrong and leukemia was the first thing that popped up. My heart dropped. From that moment I was a google fanatic and thought I had every disease in the book. I suddenly started experiencing symptoms of leukemia like fatigue and flu like symptoms. The after that I was worried I had a brain tumor. I had symptoms of that also this was the worst one for me I think. I had a buzzing noise in my ear from time to time blurred vision fuzzy peripheral vision headaches pressure on the top of my head slurred speech sometimes nausea at time etc. it was HORRIBLE. The symptoms were real. I was checked multiple times and I got a clean bill of health. Then I worried about skin cancer. I seen a dermatologist who confirmed I do NOT have skin cancer. I then found what I thought to be a lump in my abdomen and seen a doctor who said its nothing but she ordered a CT with contrast to shut me up. That was clear as well BUT did say I had a very slightly enlarged spleen which could have been caused by mono when I was younger. I had many blood panels EKGS echocardiograms CT scans Xrays urine tests I saw a chiropractor a dermatologist and many MDs before I finally decided to accept that this was a mental issue and Im NOT ill. It took me 5 long frustrating scary years before I agreed I had an issue with worrying over my health for no good reason. I seen two counselors and they helped but I knew the change had to be within me! I finally accepted the facts. Google is not the most reliable source. In fact only 42 of the health info found on google IS accurate. So your pretty much seeking reassurance from a uneducated stranger rather then just seeing your dr and trusting their diagnosis. Its hard to agree these symptoms are in your head but they ARE! You can make yourself feel all sorts of crazy symptoms so if youve seen a doctor and you have a good report the only thing you should be googling is Health Anxiety symptoms and making sure your on a reliable website such as webMD or Mayoclinic. Steer clear of yahoo answers or any of the other forums that uneducated people post on trying to give advice. In facts steer clear of google and the web PERIOD! Heres how I done itI scheduled a check up and wrote down ALL of my concerns. I talked to my doctor about my issues with anxiety and how bad I was making myself worry. He told me I need to stay FAR AWAY from google all together and I followed his orders. I had him do a full check up ekg blood work STD testing you name it just to at last put my mind at ease. Once that was over and I was confirmed healthy I started finding stuff to do like working out surrounding myself with friends and I got a job! I would leave my phone in the car locked up when I went into work. For a period of time I only used my phone for calls and texts. When i did have the urge to google Id find something else to do. Like go for a walk and talk to myself about all the tests Ive had. After ALL of these test it would be very unlikely something so sinister would be missed! I knew it was mental so I would be easy on myself. Cry if need be. But dont check for lumps dont start Letting your mind wonder keep yourself occupied at least for the first few weeks. I would set new goals for myself like school work gym. Find someone you trust and talk to them about your problems. Like for me it was my mother. Work on IMPROVING your health. Eat healthy get enough sleep get a good amount of exercise each week and take a supplement. And most of all remind yourself this is a mental thing when you start to worry and IMMEDIATELY distract yourself. Please keep in mind this is a process it didnt get this bad over night so it will not be fixed over night it will take time. Be patient with yourself. Talk to a counselor if you need to. STOP POSTING QUESTIONS LOOKING FOR ANSWERS! because you wont find them here unless your looking for ways to over come anxiety. If you believe in God pray often. If you need medication take it.Personally I never wanted meds because I dont want to be dependent on them. But if it helps you take it. If you need a break from work. Take it. Put you first. If your scared to see a doctor make the appointment and MAKE yourself go for reassurance. Remember if god forbid something is wrong Its better to find out and take care of it then ignore it and it get worse like high blood pressure for instance if you dont take meds it can potentially eventually damage arteries but its better to fix the problem and move on then to not do anything at all. But no matter what Google is not the answer. If anyone needs to talk or has questions feel free to ask me! I am pretty educated in the health field as Ive done many heard of research as well as schoolFor registered nursing. I have family in the medical field so if you feel you need to confide in someone done hesitate to DM me and we can work though this together I dont want to see anyone waste years of their life like I did if I can help it!Xoxo,Anxiety
34929,I dont wanna be like this anymore Ive been dealing with health anxiety ever since my mom was diagnosed with cancer. Every time I have some symptom I google for hours until ive convinced myself I have days left to live and have to go to the doctor right away. I saw my doctor yesterday and I could tell he thought I was insane and told me to stop googling stuff. Its honestly so embarrassing and I feel like I have no control over myself anymore. He referred me to a psychologist within the first like 5 minutes of us talking. Im just embarrassed and everyone around me is so annoyed with me constantly thinking I have some issue.

34934,Is this health anxiety?! Or something else Hello all if you take time to read and respond to my post I thank you.To begin ive been dealing with health issues since early September about 4 months now. Could possibly be lyme or something else but the results were not very cut and dry. Ever since these health issss started ive been weighed down by brain fog or at least thats how I describe it to doctors. Ive read a bit about brain fog on here but my symptoms seem a bit different could this still be alk anxiety most of my doctors have labled this as my issueMy symptoms of what i call brain fog is mainly visual things look and seem a bit offweird not exactly blurry but just off. This feeling has been with me before when i had mono 2 years ago but it only lasted about 3 weeks this time has been about 3 months constantly. My other symptoms are daily headaches dizzyunstable feeling a feeling or fuzzycongestion in my head not really in sinuses but in head and just feeling out of it.I read a lot on this reddit about not being able to remember things or think clearlyconcentrate. I dont have these issues mine seem to be mainly visual paired with headaches. Is this being caused by my health anxiety? If not do you have any ideas?Ive had an MRI two CT scans and tons of bloodwork done in the last three months. All normal except my lyme came back positive. However after antibiotic treatment and still seeing strange results from bloodwork we are thinking it could be a false positive. I definitely have anxiety about my health been a rough few months but I feel like of it was anxiety it wouldnt be causing these constant all day symptoms! Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks all! Any feedback is amazing.,Anxiety

34939,EKG changes and CT? Greeting my anxious friends. I'll cut right to the chase!ampx200BFrom April 2018 November 18th I went to the hospital 14 times or so each time with the same symptoms feeling of rapid heartbeat chest pain profuse sweating and feeling of impending doom. Each time I had an EKG and bloodwork done and the results have always been perfectly normal. I've also had a Holter done in addition to several other monitors during admission. When I went to the hospital on November 13th my EKG was perfectly normal. When I went to the hospital again on November 18th I suddenly had inverted Ts in my STsegment which they said could be indicative of insufficient oxygen to the heart muscle. From November 18th present I've had additional EKGs done which show the same change but the doctors say that the EKGs even with the change is still perfectly normal. Some say there is no ischemia and that my heart is perfectly healthy others say that they aren't concerned at all and that they don't suspect anything. I also had an extensive ultrasound done in November which shows nothing abnormal. Valves are fine no endocarditis no extra sounds. Heart monitor during admission shows nothing abnormal either. Still I am scheduled for a CT on January 22nd to rule out any atherosclerosisblockages and I am scared to death of the preop medication they want to give me to lower my heart rate to between 4050BPM. My question to the community is Have you heard of depressionanxiety causing changes in your EKG? If you Google it there is one article out of Columbia University that specifically mentions STinversions in patients with depressionanxiety. I am 27 years old 190lbs 6'4 I eat healthily and I've never smoked. I don't drink or do drugs either. The odds of me suddenly having ischemia especially from one week to the next is atomically small.

34944,65mg of elemental iron a day for the last week in preparation for donating blood. Now Im worried that Im gonna die from iron toxicity. Im a 20 year old female who typically has lower than normal iron. Not concerningly low just on the low end of average. Our college is hosting a blood drive in a few days so I bought some iron supplements about a week ago because I once told the nurse that Im often rejected due to low iron and the nurse said that a lot of people take iron supplements about a week before they donate. Well the supplements I bought are 65mg of elemental iron per pill. I started taking them before researching a safe dose because I didnt think you could OD on iron yes very dumb. After taking one pill a day for about a week I found out that the maximum safe dosage before toxicity occurs is 45mg a day. So now Im worried that Im going to die of iron toxicity,Anxiety

On Friday after finishing a week long dose of antibiotics I began to feel discomfort when moving my jaw. I felt around yesterday and noticed a raised area or lump at the very back of my upper mouth deep on the side of my wisdom tooth in the buccal mucosa area as they call it. It's on the lining of the cheek in a weird sort of muscular pocket that moves when you move your jaw hence the pain.Would cancer grow this quickly? I'm quite sure this lump wasn't there before. Salt water rinses do burn a little as though it's an ulcer or something but I don't typically get mouth ulcers so I'm unsure. ,Anxiety
34947,Love yourselfTake care of yourself. Historically for me.. JanuaryMarch is the hardest time for year for me.My Anxiety journey began two years ago in February. One of my best friends passed from a Brain Tumor the month before. I went to his funeral and they talked about all the symptoms he had.... next thing I know Im consumed by constantly looking for the same symptoms. Then they start to appear.... One day Im fine. The next day I have a pain in my neck and googled it and was convinced it was cancer and I was going to die and leave my young wife and daughter. Then I had a full blown panic attack on Valentines Day and ended up in the ER convinced I was having a heart attack.Since then it has been on and off struggles with a brain tumor fearmy longest battle. But every January the anxiety comes back with a vengeance. I know this is the case for a lot of people... the bad weather the dark days with not a lot to do it takes a toll. Remember. Take care of yourself. Excercise hell even just go on a walk. Distract yourself. Dont seclude yourself. Dont google. Eat your greens. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. Were all fighting the same battle.

34950,Eyelids twitching for many months? Just wondering how many people here have had their eyelids twitching for many months or longer? If you finally got it to go away what did you do?I see a lot of posts where people are stressing about eyelids twitches theyve had for days or weeks or sometimes hours. But mine have twitched to varying degrees since last May or so. I have tried several bouts of destressing improving my sleep meditating exercising eating bananas drinking tonic water taking multivitamins ... but cant seem to get them to stop twitching.I also notice if I blink hard sneeze look certain directions etc that theyll start twitching. If I partially close my eyes then the muscles around my eyes quiver like theyre straining to hold the position. Which leads me down the path of thinking its more than stress anxiety and something more in my muscles or nervous system. Especially since it has lasted this long through many periods of low stress.Any advice from people who have beaten this? I cant even remember what it was like to go a whole day without twitching! ,Anxiety

34952,Tunnel vision when going crosseyed? My friend found this 'thing' you can do with your eyes so I tried it and now I'm abit freaked more than abit wondering if anyone can explain it. So this doesn't seem to work inside only in bright sunlight as far as I've noticed. If you stand outside in the sunlightbright and get in a spot where your side vision is showing the blue sky or something you can clearly see and isn't crowdedmoving then begin by putting your finger infront of your face inline with your nose slowly move it in until it's touching the tip of your nose so you're now crossedeyed you'll notice the 'sides' of your vision in each eye have a tunnelvision kind of effect and go black once you stop being crosseyed it dissapears. why? Going crossedeyed straight away also does this. can someone please explain this or atleast go out of your way to try and do it just so I'm not so alarmed. you know how HA can be ,Anxiety
34954,Healthy anxiety is literally going to kill me Sorry for the essay Okay so you're all going to probably think I'm a nut job and you're probably right.. I've been a bit of a hypochondriac since a child but it's gotten way worse in recent years I'm now 27. I actually don't even know what to do anymore? I went to counselling about this last year and it did zilch! The past year has been my absolute worst!!!I'm a Googler and it's really starting to piss me off! Every single pain I get I end up googling it and lose my shit thinking it's cancer or something deadly. Heck sometimes I don't even Google it and I just assume it's something bad! The anxiety got that bad in the summer time that I was crying every night and having no sleep thinking I was going to die and couldn't get out of bed for work. I'd literally made my self depressed. I then did actually get really ill from all the worry and stress. I just don't want to have death thoughts everytime I feel a pain or a niggle! I'm even getting scared of feeling my own breasts incase I feel a lump!!! I also hate it when I see articles on Facebook telling you the symptoms to look out for for certain cancers and then those symptoms are stuck in my brain for life and I end up tying those symptoms to my pains and thus the anxiety begins! I'm literally stressed and on edge every single day now it's exhausting!So my question is is there anybody else out there suffering with this too? And how are you coping with it? I literally can't go on like this feeling like i'm going to die all the time. It's an absolute waste of life.,Anxiety

34956,I need help. In a bad state. Ive never posted on Reddit before but here it goes Im 31 female and I have been suffering and I mean suffering from what I am reluctant to label health anxiety. I have suffered from anxiety panic and depression since I was 19. I have also had severe stomach problems since I was probably about 10 years old. For the last I would say 4 months of 2018 I had intensifying acid reflux. I avidly practice yoga and it got to the point that I couldnt do down dog without bile coming back up my throat. Christmas night I suffered a panic attack out of the blue...and somewhere around that time I cant recall exactly when I must have googled that symptom severe acid reflux and ended up at the conclusion that I have stomach cancer or pancreatic cancer. I have rather honed in on pancreatic. In the weeks following this I have completely lost my appetite. Ive dropped about 1015 pounds. I have horrible dry mouth pains in my abdomen and back sporadic diarrhea when I actually can eat anything I cannot work be a mother or give my attention to anything that isnt focused on my impending demise. I have obsessively written down my theories about what I think I have my symptoms and whats causing them. I feel as if I can feel the cancer in my body. Ive even researched how to tell my child that I have cancer bc I want to be prepared. I endlessly google and search YouTube videos. I have an emergency appt with my primary care doctor of 5 years tomorrow and I am terrified. My mother is having to drive me bc I am so incapacitated mentally. I have considered checking myself into a psychiatric hospital but I ultimately see no point in that bc I know its not mental. I dont know what I want from posting this. Im just at the end of my rope and wanted to share my story. ,Anxiety

34958,How do I get over exercise anxiety? I havent worked out in years and try not to over exert myself too much because I have this fear that Im somehow going to have a heart attack and die by doing so. Idk if this is normal but when I do exert myself I get lightheaded nauseous shaky weak pins and needles sensations etc. and it just ignites my HA to the point where I try avoid it at all costs. I know exercise anxiety is a common thing among those with HA but I cant seem to break through it. Its even gotten to the point where I will unconsciously make myself breathe lighter even when not doing any physical activity just so I cant hear myself breathing I guess my brain associates audible breathing with physical exertion??. And then that leads to even more anxietysymptoms because my respiration gets all screwy from not taking full deep breaths. I really dont want to go my whole life having these anxieties when most other people dont even give it a second thought. Is there any way I can get over this? Does anyone have any advice?,Anxiety

34960,HA over some yogurt I just ate I opened up a new container of yogurt today one of those big 2 lb ones and when I did I noticed there was some liquid as well as tiny holes covering the entire surface almost as if there were bubbles that gathered on top and then popped leaving behind tiny indentations. Im not so worried about the liquid since thats common but Im wondering what those holes were. I scraped off the top layer and the yogurt underneath seemed fine so I ate it but now I cant stop thinking about the possibility it might have been bad. I know I cant do anything about it now but my mind keeps fixating on the thought that it wasnt safe to eat and Im somehow going to get sick. Does anyone have any words of advice that might help to calm my anxiety about this?,Anxiety

34962,Dealing with ALS Anxiety Hi AllThis is my first post here but I've found the content extremely helpful as I've tried to manage my anxiety about ALS for the last week or so. I'm a 30 year old male in what I would consider very good health but since an incident 2 weeks ago I've had extreme and debilitating health anxiety about having terminal cancer or ALS. It started with numbness and tingling in my feet legs and eventually groin after watching a live basketball game in an uncomfortable chair. I was already worried due to a urinary issue that started a week before this incident and has since resolved so I think I was a bit more on edge than normal. Anyway since this event I've had the perception of weakness in my body and the feeling comes and goes. I don't have any evidence of actual weakness but when I think about lifting weights I dont think I can lift the same amount that I'm used to. As a result I'm compelled to do strength tests with objects around me. It's a nightmare. To make matters worse my thumb on my left hand had been twitching slightly for 2 days now. I can see a visible pulsation in my hand near the base of my thumb and hand. I'm thinking my thumb may be twitching as a result of whatever arteryvein is there but I'm really scared. I've gone to a few doctors over the last few weeks urologist and nurse practitoner and they haven't flagged anything as a cause for concern. I'm set to see my PCP on Friday. ALS fear is consuming my life... can anyone help?,Anxiety
34964,Anxiety about heart Last week I went to the emergency room for heart palpitations. They did a chest xray EKG and blood work. In the end I was told that I had a spot on my lung and a slight irregularity in the EKG. Blood work was all fine. It was suggested I follow up with a cardiologist for an echocardiogram and 24hour holter monitor and a radiologist for the CT. I had the CT scan done last Friday and it was a calcification in the lung probably from a childhood of asthma bronchitis and pleurisy. No big deal. However the palpitations had worsened to the point I couldn't sleep on Thursday they're at their worst when I try to sleep. I spoke to the cardiologist and he suggested magnesium which has helped calm it down I think. However I've now developed a cough which has been worsening over the last few days. I went in to the cardiologist this morning to get the 24 hour EKG put on and drop off the CT scan results and just an hour after the nurse called and asked if I would be okay to move my appointment from next Monday to this Friday at 9 am. I am completely freaked out that there is something really wrongespecially since the appointment was moved up. If the doctor had noticed anything really wrong would he have gotten me in more immediately? I think all the anxiety about the condition is making all the symptoms worse and I'm not really sure how to stop it completely. Any advice is appreciated. ,Anxiety
34965,Worried about colon cancer... again. Hey all long story short Ive been worried I have colon cancer for like 5 years now with months of not worrying alternating with weeks of major anxiety. Im 24 M 190 Pounds and have struggled with blood on the toilet paper every few months. About a year ago I went to urgent care to try and remedy my worry had a digital rectal exam that the doctor said was totally normal which relieved me for all of about a month.

34980,Anyone else here with HA who works in a biomedicaldiseaserelated field? Hi everyone! This community is a great support on days I'm feeling bad and I've had this question on my mind for awhile. I've struggled with anxiety my entire life officially diagnosed w GAD when I turned 13 and have been on medsin therapy since. One component of my anxiety is bouts of severe hypochondria that wax and wane as far as I can remember my earliest memory of this is crying to my mom because I was terrified of having cancer and dying I was 7. While I was terrified of diseases I was also fascinated by them. I remember watching Mystery Diagnosis episodes when I was in middle school which while super cool to me when watching would result in me later being terrified by whatever disease the episode featured. When I began seeing a therapist and psychiatrist I got very interested in mental illness and later that led me to an interest in neurological disease in high school which eventually as it turned out morphed into my career. Very longstoryshort I ended up getting my undergraduate degree in neuroscience and am now a 1styear PhD student in molecular biology where I study protein misfolding in neurodegenerative diseases. For someone who spent much of their life with bad HA it's very ironic that so much of my time is now spent attending lectures on disease and taking courses in pathology. I still struggle with my anxiety but regularly see a therapist amp psychiatrist to keep things in check. My experience has led me to wonder if anyone else in this community has a biomedicalresearchdiseaserelated job? If so I'd love to hear your stories. ,Anxiety

34986,Has anyones anxiety gave them upper back pains? 23F. I am currently dealing with upper back pains specifically in between and around my shoulder blades and I have no idea the cause. I dont work out nor I barely lift anything more than 5lbs. I work in retail the most my body ever hurts is when I finally sit down and my feet. I sleep in the same left side position I have been for the last 2 years or so and this also helped out with my gastric issues. Im not sure if its my posture but I cant disagree that it could be. But I get no relief when I straighten my back. This painache does have the tendency to migrate between left and right spreads out in a line and seems to never go past 12 inch of my shoulder blades. The most that has changed in the last two months was my health anxiety brought on because I thought I had esophageal cancer spoiler I dont and was actually suffering from an abnormal narrowing of my esophagus and was later discovered that I also had a mild case of gastritis and duodenitis that was definitely caused by my anxiety. Back to normal lab work said that I had no infection or precancerous tissue with a follow up of a barium swallow tomorrow. I got over and past my anxiety towards esophageal and stomach cancer. But my upper back pain is starting to trigger me badly because I cant stop switching between you have lung cancer... nope its pancreatic cancer....lung cancer....pancreatic cancer and so on and so forth. I started checking for jaundice my breathing my lymph nodes WebMDingMayo Clinicing the whole shabang. The upper back pain came on roughly last week during a horrible nausea and vomiting episode for not taking my PPI. Most of my body went to normal but my back didnt. It doesnt really help that during my episode... my entire back spazzed and stiffened up when I was laying down on my back. Didnt stop until I managed to turn to my side. Yesterday I panicked so badly that I made an appointment with a counselor a psychiatrist and a physician. TLDR I have migrating upper back pains for 2 weeks no known cause from what I know. Bad HA in the last 2 months. Im becoming fearful that its between pancreatic andor lung cancer.Im just trying to live my best life...,Anxiety

The pain didn't go away for three days now and yesterday when examining it with my gf my leg has also swollen and became tender at the area where the pain comes from.ampx200BThis morning I went to my GP who measured my legs and examined them with her hands. She said she doesn't think it is a vein issue just a pulled or twisted muscle so I should just rest and take over the counter muscle relaxing meds. I told her that I did not do anything particularly active over the weekend just sleeping and playing video games pretty much she still said that I could have just strained a muscle while sleeping and it might keep on hurting for 12 weeks even. ampx200BI am still very worried and anxious as DVT is often misdiagnosed and people even die after being sent home thinking that it is just a muscle strain. My leg still hurts with no improvement whatsoever maybe even getting a bit worse although that might just be my brain it is swollen in one area but I am not feeling extra warmth and there is no discoloration. ,Anxiety

It seems to be healing and the pain from it is less every day. But my mind is convinced it is cancer from my very light tobacco use. Rationally I know it isn't but still anxiety is there. Ugh.... ,Anxiety

34991,GERD Fears Please Help Hello been a while since I posted here. Anyways I've had on and off acid reflux since I was 19 or 20 23 now. It started when I went to an ENT because my singing voice wasn't quite right I sang a cappella in college and he said oh you probably have GERD. Never did a diagnostic test or anything. Then came Summer 2017. I heard that acid reflux can lead to Barrett's and then esophageal c. Coincidentally I also started to feel a lump in my throat which I knew HAD to be esophageal c. So I got an endoscopy. It came back clean with a little irritation. BUT it was clean! Great. Needless to say the lump disappeared. I've been on and off meds for GERD ever since. For the past 69 months I've been off them because truthfully my reflux hasn't been bad. Tums or Zantac usually suffices if I need it. PPIs aren't good long term anyways. About five days ago the lump in my throat returned. Coincidentally I've been drinking more coffee lately and being very liberal with my diet. I'm hoping the lump is one of two things. 1. Irritation from increased reflux due to liberal diet. 2. Cricopharyngeal spasm essentially the upper sphincter in throat being too tight due to anxiety stress etc.. I am literally praying to God every night that it isn't anything worse but I'm still terrified. Could my clean scope have progressed to Barrett's or worse in a year and a half? Background I suffer from chronic OCD anxiety and depression. I just started my first real job since graduating college and recently moved into a new apartment. I've suffered from a sphincter spasm before... it was down south... not fun. When I take my klonopin IT IS PRESCRIBED it seems to get better. Additionally my throat feels better when eating drinking or in the morning. PLEASE HELP ME.,Anxiety
34992,Back here again Damn colon cancer.I'm afraid again and it seems more palpable than ever. This started two years ago after getting some blood work done. I got in my head that I could have colon cancer.All my symptoms began after all results were good. I started having some light blood on my stool a line here and there. Then my right lymph node grew then shrunk then grew and so on it's still swollen but smaller. Then I started having diarrhea and watery dolls with a feeling of incomplete evacuation. Then I started noticing my skin is getting pale more visible veins.I sometimes see myself going from normal to pale to normal a couple of times in a day. I do the palmar crease pallor test almost constantly now.I noticed that my fingernails were either pale or blue ish sometimes started thinking of iron deficiency and that scares the cap out of me.Then I started feeling weaker tired after very little effort should note that I put on 10 kg in this time. Arms started feeling weaker got some armpit pain chest pain etc.Then my back started hurting. My lower left back. Sometimes my lower right too. Then it started hurting more and more often. Now it hurts along my left leg as well as left hip. I read a post a while ago that said the op was diagnosed after very similar symptoms so naturally I started freaking out again.Now I'm seeing some similar stuff with my dad and it really drives me back to freaking out.I don't know what to do anymore. I'm at the end of my rope. ,Anxiety

34994,I'm Going Crazy Brain Tumor fear Hey guys.Sorry if my grammar may seem a bit choppy. English is not my first language. I'm running into alot of anxiety. I feel like I'm losing my mind at this point. I have been experiencing neurological symptoms that seem to come and go by months. It all started on Thanksgiving. The very first symptom was a strange headach. It was dull yet slightly painfull. What followed afterward was strange weakness feeling in my sholdure and jaw. These symptoms suddenly went away the after. A week I had expreinces no symptoms. In the beginning of December I began to experience these same symptoms again. All day I could not keep my mind off of these symptoms. I eventually succumbed into a full blown panic attack. Those specific moment felt like I was about to die. The symptoms continued throughout the month of December. During this time I was able to go to my family doctor. He seemed to shrug it off.They took my blood which turned out to be normal. My anxiety not stopping either. These symptoms would occasionally relive than come back. There are period where these symptoms would become stronger and new ones will form. I began to expreince strange dizziness. My balance also felt slightly off. I could not keep my mind off of it. After Christmas my symptoms seemed to have completely vanished. The symptoms seem to have been gone for a good month or so. Somehow everything felt better and I thought that was the end of that. Boy was I wrong. The symptoms all returned. And back came my anxieties of impending doom. I did notice that these symptoms returned when my period was beginning to start. It did get worse when I was on my period.... I don't know if that matters. I'm still very worried that I have a brain tumor. I feel like that my family and friends think im going crazy but they just dont understand. I'm scared and have no where to go... ,Anxiety
34995,Health Anxiety causing physically visible symptoms? I recently had my first anxiety attack back in October after a google search on some symptoms that lead me to some pretty bad stuff. It was by far the worst anxiety i have ever felt over the past 3 months. I have been constantly lightheaded since the first panic attack and have had a lot of common symptoms that people on talk about. Shortness of break tight legs back pain bowl issues and vision issues. My main issues have been tingling in my middle finger tightness in my forearm and a sharp pain in my elbow and shoulder all in my right arm. I have been to many doctors including neurologist orthopedic thoracic pain management ent PT ER 3 times and have had almost every part of my body scanned by CT and MRI. I counted over 20 blood test and so far every single thing has come back normal. One doctor thinks I have thoracic outlet but another doctor says I don't and that they are just trying to slap a generic label on my problem. This doctor also believes it is my body stuck in fight or flight mode. The one issue that seems odd is that after using my right hand such as in typing my fingers will visibly slightly swell and my hand feel tight. I know stress can cause muscle tightness and my PT keeps commenting out tight the muscles are on the right side of my body from jaw to shoulder. Has anyone had anxietystress cause physically visible symptoms such as swelling? ,Anxiety

34997,I need advice on what to do with my Enlarged Spleen ampx200BIn early december I found out that I have an enlarged spleen after MANY trips to the ER and being sent home because I was having a panic attack which I have never had before Finally after probably over 10 visits I got a Doctor who believed me and got me appointments within days... At the time I thought it was my heart I had a stress test done and a echocardiogram they said my heart was in really good condition.We also discovered I had a high Ddimer and was sent for a CT scan for a pulmonary embolism which was clear too. My Ddimer has come down since to around 511 much better but not super.I then got a ultrasound of my gut because they thought maybe it was my galbladder which was fine they did however find out that my spleen was enlarged it was something like 13.5 cm so not super enlarged it is still enlarged and it effects my daytoday life. For example I cannot lie down on that side or cannot eat too much or it gets aggravated.I have been tested for Mono it was clear I have just recently 2 days ago gotten my mirena removed I need to illiminate all possibilities no matter how small and he has put me on a high dose of 2 different antibiotics. There is nothing left that I can think of that could enlarge my spleen besides cancer or some sort of virus that has not been found.Other symtoms I am having currently I have a cough but I am getting a cold now. However I have had a dry couch since november. I can feel my nodes in my neck and they are really uncomfortable if touched or I turn my head in a funny way. Inside my left ear hurts occassionally as well as my left side of my jaw sort of where the ear pain meets my jaw. The nodes in my armpits occassionally hurt too. And sometimes my hands have a sort of aching pain as if I used them for something hard and the muscles were healing.The doctor keeps telling me to relax and enjoy my upcoming trip and enjoy life but WTH! Everything I have read online says AN ENLARGED SPLEEN IS NOT NORMAL I don't know where to go from here I need help advice... Something. I am Canadian if that makes a difference. Thank you if you have gotten this far....,Anxiety
34998,New Here Unfortunately Hi all. I am new to this forum and thought I might gain some reassurance from others who are having the same issues as myself. The last year or so has been filled with a few periods of time in which my health anxiety peaked. This often left me confused and helpless. Everything I feel or see makes me question if I am becoming seriously ill in some way. About 3 years ago I had my first issue with HA. I was having chest pains while playing baseball at school. I actually ended up going to the hospital for this and had an ECG. I was told that my heart was fine and it may just be growing pains as I was about 14 at the time. The next problem was where it really started to get much worse. About a year ago while showering I noticed a light brown spot which was probably just a stain or dirt of some sort on my foot sole. I could not stop thinking about this and was constantly measuring and photographing the spot to make sure it didnt grow. I couldnt help but to think this was melanoma. The dot eventually disappeared on its own after about 23 weeks. Next came issues of tingling in feet and hands. Being like I am I did the worst thing you could probably do which was google it. Of course it is a symptom of diabetes. I now constantly feel what I believe to be different symptoms happening each day. Each symptom I hear of miraculously occurs the next day. In fact I feel as if my vision is becoming blurred another symptom of diabetes as I type this. I know these symptoms appearing just after I learn of them is just my mind messing with me. Does anyone have any advice on how they were able to cope with these underlying thoughts? ,Anxiety
34999,Stomach problems for 1 month Hi guys me again So Ive been having stomach issues for the past month which I am pretty sure are due to anxiety stress but still have got me worried!It began a month ago when I took some magnesium on an empty stomach Ive been taking it to help with palpitations and I got crazy stomach cramps. Since then Ive had gas and bloating and uncomfortable bowel movements. I went to a doctor overseas Ive been traveling who didnt do any tests but just told me to take probiotics which I have been doing. Now that is been a couple weeks and things havent gone away Im beginning to get worried. However I cant go to the doctor yet because my medical insurance doesnt kick in until February 1st. A couple more details on my current symptoms I have gas and bloating in the morning and before I go to bed. No problems really during the day. The pain does seem to be more localized on my right hand side. I do also get heartburn. Why I think it might be anxiety is because 1 Ive travelled to 4 different time zones in the period of a 6 weeks which usually messes with my digestion. 2 Ive been pretty anxious and stressed out because of traveling flying and looking for work. 3 my diet has been really out of whack as Ive been in so many countries recently so I eat whatever is there.Im finally back home for good now so stress is going down but the symptoms have not unfortunately what do you guys think? I dont want to go to the doctor until I get insurance because it will be very expensive but waiting a week or more to see what is going on is killing me! ,Anxiety

Most nights I get this pain on my left rib cage near my upper abdomen and the pain is ONLY when I am lying down or sitting in an awkward position. Ive had this pain for about a month now it seems to come and go and its not so terrible that I cant sleep. But I am awfully scared I have pancreatic cancer due to the location of the pain but Im only 18.

35001,Fear of MS or is it just my anxiety? I know the likelihood of MS is so low but I dont know. I have very stiff and tense muscles in my arms upper back and shoulders and legs where I get frequent muscle spasms if they got overused Andy right leg has a dull burningstinging sensation in one area of I dont move it. I can feel the sensation of little shocks and tingles around those areas including the top of my head at certain points. Anxiety and stress seem to worsen the symptoms greatly as I dont really get the tingles when Im completely relaxed. I dont see a neurologist until a week and a half and I really just want it to be a combination of stressanxiety and the right muscles but that slim possiblity that it is frightens me. I dont want to live with this pain and sensations forever ,Anxiety

35003,Psyching myself out over hereditary cancer So this last Summer my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer that has since gotten way worse. When she was diagnosed and they were testing her they found out that she a gene that can cause it and that gene can be passed down to my brother and I. I dont even know the exact details of it but Ive read stuff about how with hereditary colon cancer you have anywhere from a 5080 chance of developing it anytime before youre 50. That obviously scares the absolute shit out of me. They said even with a healthy diet and exercise you still have a chance of getting it before 50. You can only do so much to control it basically. I went to see one doctor for something unrelated and she told me I needed to get screened at age 32 Im 22 but Im scared Ill get it before then and itll be too late. My mother didnt realize she had it for over a year and when she finally had symptoms she was already stage 4. Idk Im freaking myself the hell out because Ive battled intense health anxiety all my life and whats happening to my mother and what Ive learned from it is triggering the fuck out of me. It doesnt help that Im extremely picky and find it harder than most to eat healthy and the only exercise I get is walking and light lifting at work. ,Anxiety
35004,Tingling left chin and other parts should I be concerned? Hi guysSo straight into it I was stressing panic attack probably about my brothers health He got Leukaemia a few years ago because I had thought it had came back. Also been pretty depressed thinking about in the past 2 months never knew how bad it was. Now when I was worried about this I felt a tingling sensation on my left chin. This was around two weeks. Maybe 4 times or so this has happened however recently it feels like it has been more recurring not sure if focusing on it has to do with it. I was super stressed thinking Ive got cancer so I got my CBC which there was no issue with.Now I went to the dentist today and told him about the tingling. He said to me to get an xray and he really wasnt sure why it was like that. My wisdom teeth had came through and he was pretty stern on me getting it checked. That scared me a decent amount he said that xray will show what the problem is.Since this ordeal and getting the all clear after the CBC I will get random tingling throughout my body for a few seconds in small sports it goes away. As soon as I move my limb or finger they go away Ive also been a bitch more itchy of late and get the occasional sharp pains.However apart from this Ive been fine no other symptoms Eating a lot lots of energy no headaches not feeling tired no blood in stool and no night sweats. Im just concerned what this could be. Should I be concerned? Thanks guys love you all!,Anxiety

35006,Contacting an Ex about STD Testing I've been dealing with healthy anxiety particularly with being exposed to STDs specifically HIV. I've only had sex stupidly unprotected with one guy an ex from two years ago. I realize what a huge mistake that was and I have since gotten tested for all STDs and tested negative for HIV using the 4th generation test. Last time I was tested was Aug. 2018. However I've had a long list of symptoms since the exposure thus the anxiety. I haven't been able to put the fear and anxiety behind me. There hasn't been a day within the last two years that I haven't thought about having hiv. I understand that the tests are negative and I should believe the results and I want to. I'm about to start a new stage in my life and need to desperately put this behind me it's been legitimately driving me crazy. I can't eat thinkfocus sleep nowadays. I've come to the conclusion that perhaps the only thing I think would put my mind to rest is reaching out to my ex who I had the unprotected sex with himself. The thing is I haven't talked to him in over a year and have no idea how I would go about talking about this to him. But if an awkward conversation is the price I have to pay for my sanity and control of my life back then I have to do it. How do you suggest I go about this? Do I go straight to the point? I'd suggest him to get tested for confirmation. Please any advice would mean the world.,Anxiety
35007,Can't stop worrying about oral cancer I am a 20 year old and I have pretty bad HA I've had it under control for a little while now until recently when I felt a few little lumps on my gums at first I thought maybe it's a canker sore or something but my anxiety got the best of me when I saw an ad about oral cancer and it kicked my into the deep end. Now I don't know how long they were there so it was just recently I discovered it but I thought for sure that I had oral cancer. I called my dentist asked for him to check it out just to be safe he said ok. I went in today got a couple of x ray's than he looked in my mouth with the mirror thing he said Your x ray's came back good and I don't see anything wrong it looks like it might be just bit of extra bone but you have nothing to worry about. for some reason my anxiety won't let me accept that. I have been trying everything to accept hat my dentist said but for my anxiety tells me Maybe he missed it? Now have been trying everything I can to get my HA back under control but I know it's going to be incredibly difficult. So I would like to know if you have any advice that can help me I would like to hear it. ,Anxiety
35008,Toenail Melanoma? This sounds so stupid but Im worried about toenail melanoma. I recently removed my nail polish and noticed that on one of my toenails a little less than half of it is a light brown color. The pigment starts from the edge of the nail so its not a sole brown line. It just looks like half of my nail lengthwise is a darker shade. For reference I am under 30 and darkerskinned and Im fairly sure Ive had this pigmentation for awhile and its been noticed by my derm but since Ive had my nails painted Im worried that somehow it changed or it looks different than I remember. I know its more common on the thumbs index fingers big toes and its not on either of those. My two pinky toenails also currently have some brown pigmentation basically covering the whole nail. In all three toenails have some funky darker pigmentation going on right now. Admittedly this has been the first time Ive cut my toenails in a little over a month so they were long. I also tend to wear heels frequently so Im not sure if this pigmentation is more trauma based?Ive been to the derm a few times in the past year for cancermole related concerns so Id hate to keep going back. Any thoughts?,Anxiety

35011,Waiting on results the last few anxious hours are the worst. Ive been struggling with medical issues for a while now that are definitely exaggerated by health anxiety which has been hard in many ways. Mainly because I never know when Im experiencing a real symptom or my anxiety is just getting the best of me. My doc wanted me to see a neurologist who ordered an MRI. I missed the call last night with what I thought would be results which left me waiting all night. I was so ready to call this morning and have my anxiety put to ease but all they said was the results were not specific enough and the neurologist wants to see them himself. So that brings me to now about 10 am. At 11 I am planning to go grab the disk from the imaging center in my town and then bring it to drop off at my neurologist a little over an hour away. Then I have to drive home and wait for a call again. Ugh Im so sick of the waiting and Im scared its not a good sign that he needed to see it himself before giving me results.,Anxiety
35012,Chest pains and limb numbness Cardiac ischemia possible for F24? I'm female 24 years old and I've been chronically experiencing most of the symptoms describing cardiac ischemia. For a few years but more often lately. I have no issue of being overweight rather almost underweight and generally I don't seem like the type who'd have heart problems. I rarely smoke don't drink. But I do go through a lot of emotional stress am very depressed and I don't move enough spending a lot of time at home in bed. When I'm depressed I often wake up full of anxiety feeling like I'm almost having a heart attack.I know that I should probably do an ECG asap to know for sure but I will only be able to do it in a couple of months.

35015,Pulsatile tinnitus So over the last week or so I've noticed that for about 1015 seconds each day I've heard a pulsing sound in my ear that sounds like a fan whirring. At first I thought it was an external sound but then I pinned it down to coming from inside my head when I was in the bathroom one time. I googled it and it came up with pulsatile tinnitus and it said the cause could be tumours aneurysms high blood pressure hearing loss etc. I hear it in my right ear and as I said it's normally for around 10 seconds a day at random times. I've been unable to trigger it or find a way to induce it there seems to be no pattern to it. Which is odd because people who mention this talk of it being constant. I exercise regularly and do cardio and I'm cutting down on my caffeine consumption to see if that helps. I've heard this can be a symptom of anxiety or can just be heightened awareness of my own body which makes sense but don't exactly know what that means. You'd think I'd have noticed this before. Anyone experienced this before? ,Anxiety

35020,How do I handle moving forward when it was actually something this time? I know no one can answer this and Im rambling. Ive had healthinjury anxiety most of my life. Its progressed from simple illness anxiety as a kid I was genuinely terrified of throwing up in school. Still am but as an adult I feel that control to get myself out of a situation when I feel sick to now as a 45 year old person worrying about more serious things. A few years ago I was convinced I was having a heart attack. You know the drill typical symptoms but all the while I kinda knew I wasnt. But something was wrong. Turns out I have Graves diseasehyperthyroid. Its auto immune so now the statistic that one autoimmune usually means multiple has freaked me out. I have symptoms but they are not typical hyperthyroid sometimes and now I have this history of that one time it actually WAS something. Graves disease isnt that serious considering the big picture though. And I did something incredibly stupid. I did a 23 and me health analysis thing. Major dumb. I dont even have the results yet but here I go. I guarantee I will suddenly have 100 more diseases by the end of next month. And I know that one time I was right. Something was wrong. Any kind of therapy or acknowledgement of my fears is strictly forbidden in my family. We just dont do that. We suck it up and move on.

35023,Coping Idk if this will be helpful to anyone else but I've been a hypochondriac my whole life since very young. Over the last year I decided to improve my anxiety problems. I had an experience recently that kind of personified how I went about learning to cope better. Basically when I was in high school smoking weed usually gave me panic attacks until after it actually set in. After i took a hit I had a hard time accepting the reality of the situation which is the key point I am making here. As I have improved with my anxiety issues over the past year I took up smoking weed again for a while with very little anxiety. A couple weeks ago I smoked more than I usually did so the set in was much more intense. Although it felt good I noticed there was some anxiety building up in the back of my mind. I began to panic. But I decided to try just letting go and accepting the reality of what was happening. No more anxiety I was able to enjoy the drug. So basically what worked for me was accepting that something bad may happen to me and I just have to accept that and deal with it.,Anxiety

35026,Venting A little info new to the community. Im 18f weight is 165 at 54. Back in September I got diagnosed with a stomach infection called cdiff. Its been a whirlwind since then. If you read up on it its super hard to get rid of mainly because elderly people primarily get it and its a spore firming bacteria. It can kill you. It caused me tremendous anxiety. But of course with my luck I contracted it. I was on antibiotics for two months now Im waiting to retest my stool again. I have to wait a month at least in case I get a false positive stool test. Everything has been normal bathroomwise for a month. So I thought I had gotten rid of it and was excited to go back to the doctor. Until yesterday my lose stools came back. Again. And now Im through the roof just upset. If I test positive for it again Ive tested positive twice now. then I go in for a fecal matter transplant. Also for the past few months Ive been experiencing this sternum pain literally in my chest bone. Only with certain arm movements. Anywho moral of this is that I just want to be okay. Its affecting me my relationship and everything around me. ,Anxiety

35029,ThroatChest Palpatations Left Eye twitch and weakness almost everywhere So I had been doing great with my health anxiety for nearly a year. I actually havent visited this sub reddit in a few months as things were smooth sailing. It all started last Sunday and its only gotten worse. Ive been having this palpitation that happens probably 34 times ever single hour along with my eye twitching constantlypain in back of my head. It feels like I constantly have to burpthrow up. Anytime I eat I feel sick and either want to puke or use the bathroom. Accompanied with these symptoms is general weaknessfatigue everywhere. The pressurepain in my cheststomach refuses to go away. No amount of pepto or antacids works.Ive posted on this subreddit before that I am terrified of having a heart condition. Ive had a lot of testing done after one incident back in 2015 and doctors have said Im fine. I dont know what any of this could be. Maybe its something they didnt find with my heart? Maybe its something else? But its been a weak and its just been so damn frustrating. Any thoughts opinions and responses are more than welcome.,Anxiety
35030,Lower left back pains muscular or organs? Hello!ampx200BFor the past week ive been dealing with pain in my lower left back and lower left side. I dont know what do think of it my health anxiety says organs and i say muscles. ampx200BI tried to do some stretches on my left side and i felt that it did hurt and something stretched. Then i tried the same stretches on my right side and i didnt feel anything so i guess tha side is fine. The stretches just gives SOME relief for a few minutes 34 but i cant convince myself that its my muscles doing it. I think its my kidney so stomach some else organ in my body thats making the pain. Do u guys know anything about this cuz its really freaking me out?,Anxiety
35031,Something going wrong actually made me better After I had my son via emergency c section everything that could have went wrong did. I lost a lot of blood I got numerous infections and the scariest of all I developed a pulmonary embolism. If you had told me that a few years ago I would have probably died on the spot. I've always been obsessive over my health full blown panic attacks complete mental breakdowns thinking I had cancer or hiv or a brain aneurysm just waiting to take me out. I'm not saying I'm totally over my health anxiety because I'm not I still panic now and again but no where near as bad as before. The worst happened and I'm still here! Just thought it was funny how the brain works.,Anxiety
35032,Very worried about my sister My sister 26 has been suffering from pretty chronic neck pain for over 3 years now. She had an MRI 3 years ago which was normal. We tried alternate therapies including massages. They gave her a bit of relief but the pain would return every now and then. She then moved to a cold country away from us. The past summer there was quite pain free for her but in the last 34 months her neck has been severely aching again and after a recent long flight it has spread to her upper back as well. She has an appointment with a doctor about 10 days from now. Im extremely close to her and she lives more than 8000 miles away from me. I feel helpless and anxious and im imagining all sorts of worst case scenarios If her MRI was clean 3 years ago it cant be cancer or something now even though the pain is worse right? ,Anxiety

35035,I don't know what to do Ever since I got a stomach bug in september I've had SIGNIFICANT problems with not just my stomach but everywhere. It started where I felt no appetite and gagged at the thought of food along with a really bad taste in my mouthrough feeling all throughout my mouth. That's where the problems began. After the days that followed I had HORRIBLE stomach problems nausea and diarrhea. That lasted a few days before kind of subsiding. After it let I had a sitting feeling in my body that something is very wrong. I had weird cold symptoms and a sick feeling that I was an still am unable to describe. That lasted another week so I thought okay it all must be over now surely right?This is where the real problems began. The stomach problems came back in full force after a long period of having a gurgling feeling in my stomach and intestines. This is about a couple weeks after the first stomach bug so I imagine fairs fair people can have stomach bugs that come back for another round. That left and I was left with a near constant rumbling feeling in my intestines so I start to imagine it's IBS. Real problems began when I started feeling feverish every few nights and my sex drive greatly increased for some reason I can't explain before giving way to more horrible stomach problems and diarrhea again. Now finally for the past month I've felt my mental state worsening and I'm starting to worry that I have bipolar due to me feeling tired and unable to do anything every few days then a cycle of feeling overly happy and my sex drive increasing. But something that I'm unable to reconcile with the bipolar theory is that at the end of it it's often accompanied by very real physical symptoms. This is turning into me rambling but my problems have become so bizarre yet serious that I'm unable to relate to other people's simple health anxiety where they worry about cancer or something easy to identify as a problem by themselves. I don't even know what I'm meant to worry about here. All I know is I feel awful reccuring stomach problems that are somehow accompanied by me feeling like I'm losing my mind when they begin. I'm so frustrated that it's become so hard to articulate my specific yet horrible problems.,Anxiety
35036,First time questions and help Sorry if I mess this up its my first time posting on reddit and I need help.A little bit of background When I was 16 I had a seizure caused by a perforated eardrum I was on a life support for two days.Following my seizure I sort of got depressed and ended up putting on a lot of weight and never socialised with friends only on games I honestly left my house about 40 times in 6 years.Five years ago my dad had a heart attack which left him on all sorts of medications and has a lasting effect on his heart.In January 2017 my mum got diagnosed with oesophageal cancer they said they caught it early and she would survive but by the time march came she had gone from 55kg to 15kg all of the time me and my father was caring for her and watching her deteriorate. She died in the living room looking like which I can only describe as the worst thing Ive ever seen other members of the family who was there said theyve seen multiple people die of that horrible disease and my mums was the worst.After my mum died I took over full time carer of my brother who had quadriplegic cerebral palsy epilepsy severe scoliosis a collapsed lung and can not communicate.In 2018 around November I noticed a small lump on one of my testicles which caused me to be concerned and worry about it a lot this was later cleared up by an ultrasound to be nothing thankfully.Ive been doing fine but recently over christmas an incident happened which I think may have broken? Me mentally. I know this seems trivial but I wanted a peaceful Christmas but my father invited my sister and her family for Christmas dinner and said he would cook on Christmas Eve he says hes not cooking so I begin to panic I stayed up all night cooking meats and making sure everything was perfect for when they arrived. When dinner was just about ready to be served I got the potatoes off the stove and went to empty the water now this thing was pretty heavy and I needed a hand to drain it correctly I asked my sister to hold the lid so I could tilt the pan to drain. She said ok and I began to tilt the pan the lid cane flying off and all the potatoes went down the drain and was ruined. I can honestly say Ive never felt anything like that moment in my life it felt like I stood still for an hour but in reality it was five seconds while my brain tried to process what the fuck just happened. Then it settled and I just lost it I began crying and punching doors then went in to the room with my brother and just kept crying. For me as silly as it sounded Christmas was ruined I was down for like three or four days until I recovered mentally.Then on New Years Eve my father had too much to drink and basically collapsed and smashed his head on to the floor I thought he was dead as he wasnt breathing for a solid 40 seconds and didnt wake up for ten minutes.Then January came and I had some sort of panic attack in which I couldnt breathe and it felt like my brain was frozen. Ambulance came did tests and said everything was fine I just thought I had a flu or something. Since then Ive been in to hospital four times all of the time all the tests came back clear apart from an ecg which indicated there may be a slight problem. Doctor said he was 90 happy for me to go home and asked me do I have stress at home which I then told him about my mum etc and then he put it down to stress anxiety.My height is 6 ft 1 and 145kg really fatSince going to the hospital I cant stop thinking I have something wrong with me every little thing I google comes up with cancer or some sort of brain disease I had heartburn recently so the doctor prescribed me omezaproleprose to combat it as well as setralineZoloft or my anxiety. Ive had what can only be described as the rattles and havent felt like eating at all which is making me feel worse than ever. Does anyone have these symptoms?Whole body shakes and feels coldA cough that bring up phlegm sometimes Back pain and rib pain Cold hands and feet Trouble sleeping ConstipationWhen I breathe it feels like Im wheezing or my stomach is gurglingHonestly Im at wits end and my doctor keeps saying nothing is wrong just wanted a bit of insight to some of you anxiety veterans.Im also really scared to take setraline as the side effects look horrendous. Thanks guys !,Anxiety
35037,So...anybody with intrusive fears about specific body parts being injured? Feeling a little down right now so I figured I might as well lurk out of the shadows and find if theres anybody dealing with similar stuff.For something like 2.5 years Ive been dealing with recurring and everyday fear of having my ears and eyes yes its that specific damaged. Incomplete list of stuff I fearlasers big one yes in every shop as well hands mine and other people cigarettes gestures hugging patting even walking to fast knives forks even when eating by myself every sharp corner barbed wire loud sounds other bright lights list goes on and onampx200BI cannot help myself but look for dangers around me spot them and if I feel that something might have happened I seek reassurance either by somehow repeating the thing or googling stuff or asking others if they hit me. I somehow think I know that nothing happened or couldnt have happened but I still cannot let it go for some time after the trigger and in the worst cases cannot let it go for a day or something. There are multiple episodes every day resulting in my every day being disturbed being avoiding and distant pubs are so distressing.... The weird part is that I do get physical sensations for example right now I feel slight pain in my ear and a pressure because somebody patted me quite abruptly on the shoulder. I know theyre not real but they feed my anxiety and worrying.Im on 20mg of paroxetine its helped somehow but not significantly. Looking into psychotherapy options right now.Is there anybody else with similar issues? How youre doing? Whats your story?And it goes without saying crossed fingers for everybody struggling here on this sub and even though i dont post often thanks for this community!Just as I was writing this I remembered theres a grocery store at this street and now I worry if I didnt see a laser from it by peripheral vision. Yay me.,Anxiety
35038,Worried about lymph node but it also may just be a ingrown hair cyst I think its been there for awhile but I could be wrong I just know I've fixated on it this past week. Its located right above my right testicle and it feels hard and doesn't move. its probably between 12cm and I can't tell if its a cyst as the hair there does look a little red by the root. Ive now convinced myself I have cancer or HIV and feel awful. I did set up my physical for next week but some aide to my anxiety in the the mean time would help. I've had fatigue lately but im always kinda fatigued due to my autoimmune disease.,Anxiety
35039,Need some Help Was doing so good too. Hey guys! I was doing so good it had been weeks that I had finally got over my HA for the most part. However today I went down the anxiety spiral again. I was itching my back and decided to look at my moles since they seemed to be itchy. Nothing too crazy just a few itches. I've read about melanoma before and kind of disregarded it because although I have a good 60 moles none of them showed signs of melanoma. Recently I have been getting some new moles which isn't that crazy in itself but there seemed to be a lot more popping up. So anyway I unfortunately got on the Google and did some research on different types of melanoma and what to look for than preceded to check myself. I noticed two somewhat suspect moles. One is slight redbrown and the other one appears to be a kinda line. I read that linear melanoma are of the types and it looks a little similar. I'm freaking out because I don't have health insurance and don't think I can pay for a dermatologist out of pocket since I'm somewhat young and on a fixed income. Any advice on how I can handle this or anything I can do to ease my anxieties?,Anxiety
35040,Just found this sub and so thankful Im not alone with my delusions. Ive had health anxiety my entire life. Ive had every type of cancer you can imagine diabetes all the syndromes etc. I have PCOS legitimate and recently went to a specialist for it they took my testosterone levels via blood test and they were supppeerr high he said the only time its this high is when theres a potential tumor on the ovary or adrenal gland. So naturally Ive been an anxious mess the last 4 days living on Xanax. Im getting scans and tests done within the next two weeks to not only rule that out but to see how my fertility is. He said that most cases the tumors are benign but us hypochondriacs dont hear the positive statistics we hear the negative and nothing else. Just had to share. Im trying to think positive thoughts via my therapist but we all know how that goes! ,Anxiety
35041,Fitbit heart monitor is terrible for my health anxiety. I had a panic attack in Oct. It lasted for 12 hours. I ended up in the emergency room. Had blood work ECG and chest xray. Everything came back good. In fact I wasn't even worried I could have a heart condition until I was checked for it. After that I was convinced something was wrong with my brain. I thought I had a brain tumor stroke etc. After a while I calmed down on that still going to see a neurologist though because I suffer from a swaying dizziness when I'm anxious.Now I'm obsessed about my heart. I got a fitbit for my birthday and I religiously check my heart rate all day long. Checking it makes it spike. If I'm resting I can usually get it down to the 60s but if I keep checking it it spikes up in the 90s. When walking around it ranges from had palpitations typing this 110140 depending on how anxious I am. If I don't look at it it goes down if I do man oh man does it rise. During a panic attack it was 150. I sat down and calmed myself down and it dropped to 100. Blahhhhh.,Anxiety

35043,Head pain!!!!!! Someone please help..... For the past three weeks I have been experiencing the strangest head pains ever. Shooting pains around my head that move around and are different each time sometimes its the same spotnot always A lot of it occurs behind my ears as well. The head pain is debilitating when it comes on feels like im being stabbed in the head but at the same time is kind of dull Its a pulsating feeling and doesnt normally last that long. This is happening every single day No exaggeration and has sometimes been accompanied by a dull normal headache. I went to the ER they took a regular CT and said it was normal. The head pain will come suddenly last a few minutes and then most of the time go however one night i had a pulsating dull stabbing pain for about an hour....I took a Tylenol and It eventually went away until about 9 hours later when the aching pain returned. I havent ever experienced headaches or pain like this.. and its every day for weeks now...I am also getting weird sensations all around my head like burning pains and hotcold pains aswell. I do have health anxiety and have experienced shooting like pains in my head from panic attacks however this is not the same thing. These are real headaches unfortunately...because of these symptoms though I have convinced and self diagnosed myself with a brain aneurysm thats about to rupture at any given moment. this is the worst part. I have no history of brain aneurysms in my bloodline but somehow have convinced myself I have one. I know I had a normal CT and that reassured me a bit but then i read somewhere they arent always caught and you need to have a CT with dye to catch them. cue the anxiety again I just want to know what these types of pains can come from? I dont understand.....any ideas? and any ideas on how to cop with thishas anyone else ever been afraid of this? ugh. It sends me into a full blown panic attack when i get this headache now which basically means im anxious all day everyday. Im tired of being so scared and bracing to drop dead every time i get a head pain... help!!! ,Anxiety
35044,Doctor doesn't know what's wrongMRI canceled Over the past month I've experienced pulsatile tinnitus in one ear along with ear and headaches. Some days I feel no symtoms others it's horrible but the pulsing sound remains. I also feel this weird tingling on the side of my head same as the effected ear. I also have this weird feeling like I'm on a strong pain pill. Though when I go outside I don't feel nearly as bad honestly being inside starts alot of my symtoms. The doctor believes it's idiopathic intracranial Hypertension or a venal issue. May I add that when I press on the area around my jugular the sound fades or if I lay on the side that pulses it all goes away as well. I have yet to have a MRI as it was canceled I'm scared it's a tumor please help. My mind has been racing for a week on what this may be. I'm 18Female,Anxiety
35045,Tender spot on top back of head after strain...scared I havent had to post in any anxiety subreddit as often as I used to but I guess one never really is cured of it are they.So to put it politely I had to strain to use the restroom tonight.About 30 minutes later I start getting this headache on the top right of my head. Its a numb pain until I touch or put pressure on it and it becomes more sharp.My aneurysm fear is STRONG tonight. I wouldnt be as scared if it werent for my going to the bathroom but now all I can imagine is a blood vessel stretched to its limit somewhere in the top right of my head. I even feel a bit of throbbing when I lay down.Ugh. Im sick of having these fears.,Anxiety

35047,Convinced myself I have Huntington's disease The rational side of me knows that these symptoms have either been there for a while or they can easily be explained by any number of other less serious causes. Not to mention that as far as I know no one in my family has this disease.I was reading about Lewy body dementia and someone had described it as being a mix of Parkinson's dementia and Huntington's the last of which I'd never heard of. So I went to learn about it and since I'm me I started drawing parallels between the symptoms and things I've either been experiencing or that I wasn't experiencing until they were suggested.Firstly I'm in the typical age range when symptoms manifest. My confusion occasional inability to understand things indecisiveness occasional problems with concentration forgetfulness and fatigue must be due to this disease not because I never get enough sleep. My bouts of dizzinessvertigo are the coordination problems even though they're most likely a mix of exhaustion and severe tension headaches. I've noticed lately my index finger on my right hand sometimes twitches when I hold it just right on my mouse never mind the fact that I've had that happen before with other parts of me if I position myself a certain way. Fidgeting must be a symptom too even though I've fidgeted my WHOLE LIFE. Me being freezing cold must be the telltale tremors! And the anxiety and depression I've had for what feels like forever MUST be Huntington's too right? Muscle stiffness can't possibly be due to me being out of shape! My inability to remember a word now and again or have words come out coherently must be from illness and not the fact that my brain to mouth filter has always been haywire. I have issues swallowing and breathing that could be due to Huntington's... or you know the esophagus problems I've been having.Also read that one possible symptom is visual disturbances and lately I've been experiencing what looks like rippling water in my left eye. I realize that could be any number of things and generally as long as my vision itself is okay it's nothing major. But if I was thinking rationally I wouldn't be posting here.And while the disease seems to be hereditary all I had to do was read something about how only a majority of cases are inherited implying that some people 13 of cases can still develop it even with no family history.Not to mention that practically all these symptoms can be caused by ANXIETY too. Never mind I had a CT about a year ago when many of these same things were happening that was normal. Never mind it's rare something like 15000 people in the entire US have it. NOPE must be Huntington's!,Anxiety
35048,Shortness of breath for only seconds at a time.. For as long as I can remember Ive been getting these weird feelings in my chest that feel like I completely lose my breath. It only lasts for about 10 seconds then stops but its a STRONG sensation. It feels like when you jump into extremely cold water and it takes your breath away except Im always just sitting there doing nothing when it hits. I always related it to sinus problems or allergies but Im not having issues with any of that right now and the issue is worsening. It happens like 2 to 3 times a day now. I seriously dont know if this just random panic attacks hitting or a heart or lung issue?? Im convinced Im dying but I cant afford to go to the dr right now let alone an emergency dr. I feel like it cant be panic attacks if it happens when Im in a perfectly good mood. Sometimes Ill be sitting at my computer at work... sometimes Ill be putting my son to bed... its just random. But the feeling is making my anxiety 100 times worse and for the whole month of January Ive basically had crippling anxiety from it. Not even in the food to function anymore. Im over it. Thoughts?,Anxiety
35049,Rewilding Helped Me Beat Health Anxiety Hey guys my personal experience with health anxiety came from seemingly nowhere. One day I had chest pain and then every day for months after that I dug myself deep into this dark chasm that is health anxiety. At my lowest I was up till 4 am on WedMD every night almost got fired from my job and most importantly living in chronic PHYSICAL pain. The TLDR of my story is that rather than seeking comfort hot baths heating pads painkillers I began to seek discomfort and that led me to what I now understand as rewilding. Basically you are reaffirming your body how strong and capable you really are by exposing yourself to elements that we humans previously had to deal with constantly....long before the days of anxiety lol. Take some cold showers. Go out into the elements for at least 20 minutes a day. Develop a deeper relationship with your breath. If anyone is interested in more information on this I'll happily write an article but I'm not an expert just a practitioner. The man responsible for the term is Daniel Vitalishttpwww.danielvitalis.comrewildyourselfpodcast. But there are others doing similar stuff such as Wim Hof. Reaffirming to myself that I am strong was the only thing that pulled me out and it started with seeking discomfort learning some stoicism and severing the emotional attachment I had to my physical symptoms. You can do it too. Love Max ,Anxiety
35050,Dry Skin This might be better suited for ranxiety in general but since my anxiety seems to be health anxiety I figured I'd start here. As a background I've never had an anxietystress issue prior to September but Labor Day weekend I had what I now know was a panic attack that sent me to the ER. Since then I've been convinced of heart disease brain tumor diabetes and have been under constant stress the entire time with every single thought it seems being dedicated to why I feel the way I do. MRI ultrasounds EKG stress test blood work all comes back clean and my doctor just tells me it's stressanxiety.ampx200BThe last few weeks I have had ridiculously dry skin which I have never had before. I saw my doctor last week and again he said it's just stress and none of my tests have been out of the ordinary to suggest otherwise. He started me on Celexa this week has been a roller coaster of suck but I'm hopeful for anxiety.ampx200BHas anyone dealt with chronic dry skin as a result of anxiety? If so what was your best way to help? I know clearing stressanxiety meditating etc. but I'm thinking more of the immediate while I work on me. It's hard to break the anxiety cycle when every time I touch something or move my skin hurts.,Anxiety

35052,Those of you who have had an mri what did you have it for and did they find anything wrong? I had one today because my foot was tingling for the past three weeks non diabetic related did blood test previously and all came back normal and my dr saw nothing severely wrong that needed er attention with my foot and then my mom thought oh its probably my Valium that Im on for anxiety causing the tingling cutting down. I still felt like I needed to get checked for this so I went dr had ordered a lumbar spine mri and come to find out they did the quick results where they tell em what was wrong until my dr calls or I go in to go over the results more in detail and of course I have a bulging disc in my back as well as arthritis If youve had one done what reason did you have the test for and did they actually diagnose you with what you thought you had or was it something different you werent expecting or did they just say it was probably just anxiety and nothing was actually wrong?,Anxiety
35053,Either I'm a hypochondriac or I'm on my way to being a statistic unbiased advice needed Content warning for some grosser medical stuff i guessampx200BSo i'm here because i can't honestly tell if the situation im in is entirely in my head. Short background in august 2018 .i had some fatigue joint pain intestinal issues and i had missed my period 2 months straight so i went to the dr and after bloodwork they determined i had hyperthyroidism and a positive ANA. They also found my sed rate to be elevated slightly and my CRP was around 7. 5 months of doctors visits a loose diagnosis of thyroiditis after my levels went from hyper to hypo and then normalized blood work back in normal range for thyroid and ANA. I basically get a clean bill of health all my bloodwork looks good. Except my symptoms worsened. My anxiety and depression also got worse which is why im wondering if im just manifesting symptoms because of my mental healthampx200BThe symptoms i had that were strongly associated with thyroid have mostly gone away except for the fatigue but now new stuff is popping up. For the past month i've been having period problems abdominal pain and gastro problems. I had a normal period in the last week of december but then 2 weeks later i had 6 days straight of weird heavy spotting. throughout this time technically since august actually i was having diarrhea every morning without fail and intermittent constipation. it came with abdominal cramping and severe nausea that goes away after i use the bathroom. I also completely lost my appetite and was having really strong nausea almost daily. I had stretches of days where i just couldn't bring myself to eat despite being super hungry it just made my stomach turn. Despite eating less than i usually do and the fact that i usually lose weight really fast when restricting calories I've been gaining weight and my stomach has grown so big i can barely fit into my pants. Shortness of breath has become a weird problem too. idk if its related. ive always been bad at breathing but i get winded getting off the bed to use the bathroom. laying down on my back makes me feel like i cant breath too.Yesterday i went to the ER because since about 112 i've been getting really intense sharptwisting pain in my lower left and lower right abdomen as well as a general dull ache right above my groin. The stabbing comes and goes sometimes there will be 12 min stretches where it is extremely painfulwaves of stabbing pain but then i wont feel it for another few hours. I recently looked down and realized the left side of my stomach is bulging out a little farther than the right side. Its hard to tell as i have a softer stomach anyway. I was supposed to get my period on 125 i believe but instead i had spotting the whole week and then on 128 during one of my classes i got horrific lower back pain and strong cramps. I had severe nausea and the pain was so bad i nearly cried. And yet still only occasional light spotting. This is highly unusual for me as i usually have very light and painless periods with only moderate cramping exactly when i start bleeding. I took tons of painkillers and fell asleep but woke up in just as much pain and still hadnt started bleeding. So i went to the ER the next morningThey did an internal ultrasound bloodwork and a urine test. The blood and urine came back mostly fine. They confirmed that my thyroid levels were normal and my liver and kidneys are in good order. Lymphocytes are a bit low globulin a bit high and in the urine test they picked up some protein and blood but they assumed that was from traces of the spotting i was experiencing. The ultrasound found that my ovaries and uterus look unremarkable. There were small follicles present as well as evidence that a cyst may have ruptured on the right ovary and there was a small amount of free floating fluid. Shortly before i left i started bleeding normally as well. I was surprised honestly. Looking down and seeing how bloated i am and feeling the immense pain on my left all the time i really expected them to find something. ampx200BI'm still in immense pain and i'm confused. This all set off alarm bells in my head. i tried to brush it off for a long time but the pain just got worse and worse. I'm gonna obviously wait out my period and see if the pain persists after. I have a CT scan scheduled ordered by the dr on my campus i had gone to her about the pain a few weeks before the er thing happened for feb 9th but it costs 3k for me.. I don't want to waste the money if i wont find anything. I can't keep wasting money on medical bills that aren't helping me Literally any and all advice is welcomed as well as similar experiences. thanks guys,Anxiety
35054,Obsessive about heart rate chewing tobacco At night my heart rate has been in the 60s slowly trying to quit chewing tobacco but recently started worrying that my heart rate is too slow especially since I just put a dip in and that is supposed to elevate heartrate and blood pressure but my heart rate is still in the 60s to 70s range scared I'm always in heart failure... literally laying here thinking my heart is failing and scared to call 911 because of many false alarms in the past that lead me to call 911 about 4 times in 2 weeks only once taken to a hospital where they wanted me to stay inpatient but with agoraphobia and panic attacks I was too uncomfortable with the idea of being locked up away from home and no way of getting out before a 3 day stay... feeling depressed and hopeless and that I'm gonna mistake a real heart attack for a panic attack or just write it off as my body being calm from meds I take... idk just don't have anyone to talk to about this especially at night 9pm where I'm at...,Anxiety
35055,Can glandular fever cause problems years later? I contracted a bad case of glandular fever when I was 14 and was in hospital for a couple of months on an IV and even had to use a wheelchair as I lost so much weight. It took me four months to go back to school full time due to being so exhausted all of the time. Before all of that I was mostly healthy maybe a bit underweight and had an underactive thyroid but I was healthy. It was also around this time that I began struggling with manic depression and anxiety which I am now medicated for.Im now 19 and my thyroid has began working normally again but I am constantly ill. I have colds at least once a month if theres a flu going round I catch it despite my best efforts to keep up with the preventative measures. I had 7 chest infections last year. 7. I recently was hospitalised for a kidney infection then haemorrhaging ovarian cysts and ive just been diagnosed with ANOTHER kidney infection just three months after the last one. Everything else Im told by doctors is healthy Ive had blood and urinary tests ultrasounds and countless antibiotics and multivitamins. In addition to these other symptoms Ive developed psoriasis and my hair is falling out and Ive also lost most of my toenails. Im beginning to get embarrassed about being ill so often and that people might think Im making it up.I cant help thinking this is all somehow linked to developing glandular fever. I know its possible to have long term ME afterwards but I was wondering if anyone has a similar story regarding this?? Ive been to countless doctors about the various symptoms but none have gotten any better. Ive gotten so frustrated I have started to keep track of when Im ill what symptoms I have and theyve began to link together... In my mind my immune system has been seriously compromised since that time and I cant think of any other reason why. ,Anxiety
35056,Heavy deja vu followed by negative feeling So I have a health anxiety over my brainfear of going crazy is my anxiety theme after I had weed induced dpdr and after reading something about schizophrenia my anxiety has been the worst.So 5 months has passed since that and I'm still feeling dpdr symptoms.And this one symptom is so bad and its deja vu and when it hits me I get this bad feeling that I am slipping into something terriblelike all of this happened and that bad thing will happen as well and I don't know what to think about that.I am so worried about my brain because this doesn't seem to be normal to me.I would appreciate if you could inform me a little about this.,Anxiety
35057,Fear of allergic reactions Over the past few months I have developed a fear of allergic reactions. It has become so bad that I will start to feel allergy symptoms after taking almost anything.

35058,I have yet another disease.. This time I have weakness in my left arm and hand. Not severe I can still move it and grab things but it's noticeable. My left arm has just been feeling weird for the past week. I feel a tiny bit of weakness in my right forearm too. My mind keeps racing towards ALS and I don't know how to calm down.,Anxiety
35059,The third appointment in a row where I have not been examined So I am well known to my gp practice recently due to a lot of issues with depression and anxiety. Long story short I wasn't fit to work and was very much suffering on the antidepressant that I had been put on. I was suicidal and close to the edge having panic attacks on the daily etc. I have since come off the antidepressant and it has been thw best decision I have ever made for myself. The anxiety is still there and always has been and I suspect always will be but I am functional again I couldn't even open my work email or answer an unexpected knock on the door without risking a panic attack and now I'm back at work.In the last month I have been experiencing intermittent stabbing shooting pains. I have a history of chronic muscle tightness and pain. I am currently in physio for trapezius and neck pain I also have midback tightness. I have previously had my legs in casts and afterwards splints to manipulate my calves into the correct position. I know what a muscle cramp feels like. I know what a pulled muscle feels like. I know what a muscle spasm feels like. I know what DOMs feels like. This new pain is on another level and it is vastly different in nature. I can't sleep I can't lie comfortably I can't concentrate properly I will involuntarily have to change position and grab the effected limb when the pain comes on.The pains that I am experiencing are not in the usual suspects of my calves or backneck but in my groinarmpitsideback of my thigh and glute areaankleelbow. My Google history is looking pretty crazy as a result. I have seen three different doctors at my gp practice about this because I am extremely distressed. Not one of them has examined me. All that has happened is that I have been counselled about psychosomatic symptoms being a thing and encouraged to get back on antidepressants. I feel like nobody is taking me seriously and this being the UK GPs are very much the gatekeepers to other services. While I would be willing to pay for answers if it comes to it I wouldn't even know where to start because I have no idea what could be causing all this. I'm crying as I'm typing right now from a stabbing pain in my groin. I just cannot believe that it's all in my head when my mental health is so much better now than it was. ,Anxiety
35060,Fear of going to the doctors... I'm finally going to the doctor. Not really confronting fears but having swelling and pain of my tonsils and a bit of my throat which has me mildly freaking out.I'm wondering what the doctor will say or do. Maybe just prescribe me something.My fear isn't that hospitals are crazy but if my doctor says I'm basically ok I won't believe them. I'm hoping this basically cures my health anxiety but I know that a lot of people with HA don't believe the doctor...I just hope I trust them enough.,Anxiety

Hi guys First post here I'll be stuck on a plane for at least 12hrs tomorrow and i'm nervous just thinking about it.Occasionally when my anxiety peaks my whole body will experience numbness and pins and needles spreading across my entire body which freaks me the fk out as i feel like i have no control over my body head to toe and am going to spasm.

35065,Health anxiety is the worst Health anxiety can be so incredibly difficult. I've struggled with healthrelated anxiety alongside other anxiety struggles my entire life. It seems as though when one 'health worry' disappears could take days weeks months a new one appears. It's absolutely exhausting and takes over my mind for the entire day. Has anyone found improvement from therapy and if so did you seek a certain type of therapy? I'm going back on my medication antidepressants after coming off of them a few years ago. This past month has been almost unbearable and things have been bad since the summer after suffering a skin cancer scare. Any tips for coping? Today has been really rough. ,Anxiety

35067,I somatized fever. One thing I never thought I could have is a fake fever. Fever is your body fighting with different harmful organisms so it's doing good by doing bad. All fevers must be real right? Maybe.I was so afraid of Dengue Fever after a mosquito bite I had that it was driving me insane. I was literally counting days and hours until the certain first symptoms. I had it once and fever it spikes out of nowhere up to 40 degrees for days basically destroying you. So in the past week I was just waiting for fever come. It was an evening and I started to feel my legs arms and face really hot and weak. Panic attacks followed and I was constantly taking my temperature. It went from 364 373 375 but never above. I kept having this for 5 days in a row until it finally stopped after going to the ER. If I payed attention to something else it'd cease for a while. The conclusion is you can somatize everything including fever.,Anxiety

35070,Numbness sensation on chest around heart after waking up once in a while please... does anyone else experience this? So this is seriously at risk of ruining my day after doing so well for so long so I'll try keep it brief.I read an article about snoring and sleep apnoea last night according to everyone who's ever slept in a room with me I do snore heavily but don't have sleep apnoea.But this article I read said that even snoring is bad for you and I got freaked out. I wake up sometimes with dead or asleep arms making me think there's something seriously wrong with my heart and circulation though my fiance convinced me this is just cause I move my arms to weird positions and the circulation gets cut off temporarily.But something my fiance can't talk me down from is the fact that sometimes I wake up with red indentsmarks all over my body along with like a numbness or asleep feeling around my lower chest on the left side stretching around to my side. The thing is I can only ever remember this happening on the left side I.e. where the heart is but I'm always very groggy when this happens so maybe it does happen on the right and I don't take notice? I only bring it up because it happened recently. The sensation goes away within 10 minutes or so.Has anyone else ever experienced this? It only ever happens when I am in very deep sleep having very vivid dreams and then wake up suddenly.,Anxiety
35071,Fear of Brain Aneurysm presenting as Headaches and Pulsatile Tinnitus So for the last five years or so i 26m have had some various symptoms that i am not sure are simply me being aware of them or something much greater. In particular I experience Pulsatile Tinnitus where i can clearly hear my heartbeat thumping in my left ear much greater than my right. Exertion makes it much more noticeable. Occasionally I also experience mild to moderate headaches that seem to follow a distinct line from the back of my skull to right behind my left eye. Some mornings if i sleep on my left side I will wake up with a headache on the left side of my head that throbs in time with my heart and laughingsneezingstraining can create a very weird sensation in that same area behind my left eye. I don't know if i could describe it but to my HAaddled brain it seems like what you'd feel if you had a ballooned vein suddenly swell slightly.I also have been experiencing a slight visual disturbance in the left eye where lights and bright objects have a small shimmery 'smear' above or below them hardly noticeable unless I'm looking for it but still strange. I know symptomatic unruptured aneurysms can cause double vision but this seems to minor that I couldn't trust whether or not this is what 'double vision' entails. I have 2020 vision don't smoke drink or do drugs no family history of aneurysms to my knowledge my grandmother did die of a stroke she was 86 though. I did have a MRI done when i first encountered these symptoms about 5 years ago and they found nothing the visual disturbance was there during that time but I'm unaware if the pulsatile tinnitus was.I've had a long bloody history with Health Anxiety and I'm reaching out to you guys to finally admit that i've got a worrying problem. Can anyone shed light on if my fears are justified?,Anxiety

35074,Today's health anxiety level shakily taking temperature with a meat thermometer because I couldn't find a human one Today I'd felt pretty okay honestly. Minus my usual stressed outness a mini depressive episode and being upset I slept in late it'd be a pretty solid day!ampx200BThat is until the little voice in my head going hey you should google some symptoms you know its probably just a cold but just to be sure. So I looked up the fact I've been experiencing flushing in my face and decided that oh god it might be rosacea oh god what if its cushings before calming down and saying its probably normal. I noticed it wasn't just face flushing my whole body felt warm so I must have a fever right? It makes sense as I've been fighting off a cold for a while now. but then just to completely fuck up my day my brain thought of that little key word that can send me spiraling sepsis. I looked up the symptoms for sepsis for the millionth time in my life. I took my pulse by hand and it was 100 I took it using two different apps and it was always above 90. That was one check off the list. I couldn't check my blood pressure because I couldn't go get the machine without alerting my family to my weird behavior but I didn't think I felt like I had low blood pressure at the moment but do I even know what that feels like? What if this is what it feels like? I switched immediately to the next test I could try my temperature. I know I've felt my skin warm to the touch but I'm naturally someone who gives off a lot of heat but the heat on my face and neck felt abnormal but I needed to know how abnormal so I tore up the areas where we keep health stuff that I could tear up discretely and found no human thermometers. It then hit me that we have meat thermometers! A quick google search didn't really say if they'd be effective for taking usual underthetongue temperatures but I'm sure it would work anyway. I cleaned off a thermometer and stood in the mirror with it under my tongue so I could see the display. The numbers slowly kept creeping upwards and the suspense was throwing me into a panic that I must have sepsis but how did I get it? Oh gosh it must be the canker sore I noticed on that one part of my gums that have been swollen for a bit that's it its because I don't brush my teeth after every meal bacteria from my teeth got into my blood and now I have sepsis and I'm going to die. And then the thermometer eventually plateau'd somewhere around 95.4 or so. And now I'm somewhat calmer but I just can't help still feeling weary. Writing this all out here though has sorta helped me illustrate to myself how ridiculous it has been which is much better than I've handled the fear of having sepsis in the past! So wooo to me ,Anxiety
35075,Am i a hypochondriac? I am a 24 year old female and would like to preface this by saying that I do actually have a few chronic illnesses that have been diagnosed one of which is an autoimmune deficiency. As well as severe anxiety with frequent panic attacks. That being said for years now I have been hyper focused on various symptoms my body has displayed that usually end with them disappearing and me forgetting they ever happened. But with every pain or nausea episode I have I end up spending hours googling symptoms and what they mean. For years now I have put in anywhere from 28 hours a day on various medical websites. This week alone I have convinced myself that I haveibsCrohn'sbreast cancerkidney failurepregnacykidney stonespatellafemoral syndromewormsdiabetic ketoacidosisan impending heart attackI am tired of being scared all the time.

35077,I have to vent! I am so rattled right now. I hate going to the doctor and going makes me freak out. My heart races my blood pressure rises and my temp always rises to about a 99.0 which freaks my nervous Ass out. I havent had blood work done in nearly two years when I had leukemia anxiety. I am seriously petrified of what could come up in any blood work that is done. I am worried that Ill find out Im anemic because Im losing blood somewhere I fall asleep on the couch on occasion and it scares me. A new fear I also have is that I will faint when having blood drawn which has never happened before. Earlier this week I built up the courage to go to my allergist so that I could get an update on my meds I start to tell him about my recent weight gain from eating out all of the time and being careless with my diet. And he convinces me that there is something wrong with my thyroid from my Zoloft. I am just so frustrated because I want to rule everything out and make sure I know I am fine to get started on getting this dumb anxiety to go away. But I am scared. He didnt take my blood today but when I go see my Gyno in two weeks he wants me to. I am so nervous. Ugh help!! Has anyone else dealt with this. TLDRI am freaked out by the doctor. My allergist wants me to get bloodwork done and just the idea is making me crazy ,Anxiety

35081,I'm genuinely unhinged I currently and have done for the past week have pinching cold tingling sensations all over my body. It starts off as a tingle and distils into a pinchy itchy feeling. I have no rash it's all over my body fingertips neck hairline ankles elbows. I'm going mad. I want out of my skin and mainly out of my head. I cannot believe that my mind would cause such symptoms if it is that and not something massively creepy and neurological. I'm obsessed with my health keep imagining a great big tumour pulsating away in my head. The symptoms become worse the more I concentrate on them and I can create pretty much any feeling depending on what I decide to latch on to and worry about. The last fear was unequal pupils and that's triggered a worry something neurologically wrong. I went to the eye hospital and they scanned my eyes looking for abnormal discs pressure etc nothing was wrong. I also had another perfect blood test.

35082,Expartier now healthy but with major HA Wondering if anyone else has dealt with this!I am now 27. When I was 18 I started a 6year long party bender. Daily marijuana pack of cigarettes a day drinking 56 nights a week MDMA every weekend. It was intense. I was on Zoloft at the time for my anxiety and depression due to a crappy upbringing and social anxiety.Flash forward to now. Quit pills 4 years ago quit weed 1.5 years ago quit cigarettes a month ago and now only drink once or twice a week. HOWEVER. Since getting healthier and stopping substances my body has freaked out and feels like complete garbage every day. I have constant heart palpitations tingling and headaches. I've had ECGs a brain CAT scan MRI on my chest lung xray blood pressure monitor and numerous blood tests and literally they can't find anything wrong with me. I am sad because I feel worse now than I ever did during my party days and according to doctors I am in great shape considering. Also go to the gym 34 days a week.

35083,would my may2018 ECG of picked this up? worried! so yesterday I was drilling some wood and I out of nowhere felt a dul pain in my left arm and chest I think it was brought on by putting arm in or moving it in specific positions and when I took a breath my left side of chest hurt! it went on like for a few seconds and the simptoms subsided but sometimes if I take a deep breath or lay in some positions it hurts the arm or chest but if I am just sitting still on my computer it doesn't hurt I read about silent hart attacks and this caused me to have my anxiety spiral out of controle again! If there was anything wrong in my heart would it of showed up on my ECG or is it possible that this could be something new? I keep worrying but I haven't let this whole thing keep me from enjoying my day. I had my ECG in may of 2018 when my anxiety had spiraled out of controle over some palpitations that were 99.9 attributed to eating too many of those chocolate easter eggs. What I notice from the new simptoms though is that the pains are very intermittent and come and go like sometimes I will feel some chest pain if I take a deep breath sometimes if I raze my arm or hold it a certen way etc I was able to get a good night's sleep but still worrying about the whole possibility of some undetected heart thing or a potentially dangerous problem.

35084,Palms of hand acting strange! Photos httpsimgur.comam9nXmwGWhile I was in my mirror pinning clothing to be sewn my palm on my left hand started acting funny and I looked at it and it seems to look like its swollen a bit. My right hand was doing that for a while had a very random hyperextending thumb which Ive never had but now it bends back far whenever I hold it up. I also noticed the veins in my hands body in general are extremely noticeable but I wasnt worried too much about that part as I am a pale person and none of them are varicose veins. I do have shown in last photo this pinchedswollen looking vein or tendon no idea WHAT that is a little below my index fingers that had shown up over the summer and that was what started health anxiety in my life to begin with. If anyone knows if it looks like something is actually off I would appreciate any advice. Ofc going to a doctor is always the best bet but I am about to travel for a weekend out of countryI believed for a while that I may have carpal tunnel by the way my palms and some fingers have been acting.

35085,Worried about my gallbladder.... I'm 25 21 BMI not super active but I've been good about eating whole foods and fiber though I've had a bad sugar habit. I'm also on an oral contraceptive trilo sprintec and I cut my calories to 1000 for a few weeks to lose weight. That plus my irregular eating habits and tendencies to skip meals puts me at risk for gallstonesI think.Last Sunday I noticed I had some really sharp pains on my right side under my ribcage. This isn't totally abnormal I have had this before but this time it was much sharper and deeper than normal. It lasted like a minute or so and happened a few more times but it wasn't anything seriousjust left me feeling a little chilly. But for whatever reason my brain was immediately thinking that's gallbladder pains and I got worked up. For the rest of the week I've been panicking every time i've had a pain or sensation in the areawhich has been fairly often making me wonder if it's psychosomatic or if something is actually wrong. I've had some pangs radiate into my shoulder and my arm as well convincing me even more it's my gallbladder and not me panicking. TMI but I also had some considerable gas and bloating throughout the week and I woke up more nauseous than normal most morning and I've had indigestion and stomach pains a bit after eating as well. I stopped eating stuff with a lot of fat and sugar in hopes that I wouldn't have an attack worse than what I experienced Sundayin fact I cut out fat almost completely I've been too afraid to eat it.I went for a checkup on Thursday and my doctor ordered bloodtests and an ultrasound on my upper right quadrant. I haven't gotten the results yet but I got a call from someone at the clinic a day after about information that my doctor wanted to share with me but it went to voicemail and when I called back immediately after they never answeredjust to add to my worry!And now to add even more to my worry my urine is darker than normal which is another sign of gallbladder dysfunction I've read about...though I did have beets for lunch...I've been panicking about this for an entire week and I know it's nothing to really be stressed over...I've changed my diet as much as I could and I'm getting everything taken care of but I'm terrified of having another attack or something awry happening in between now and my blood resultsultrasound. And I'm scared for many reasons of having my gallbladder out...I've never had major surgery and I've heard about chronic digestive issues people have after they get it removed...thought that definitely sounds better than having an infected gallbladder explode inside of you.Just wanted to vent...I've had to keep myself off of the internet because I kept psyching myself out more and more and I think it may have ended up giving me more symptoms. I've been so doom and gloom over this and I normally can convince myself to relax even when I'm worried about something being wrong with me but this time I haven't been. Don't know if it's intuition or what.,Anxiety

I've been googling non stop and I don't know what to do. I've been googling people who lost their hearing and are completely depressed and HIV related to sinus issues because I still have a runny nose all the time and maybe I'm undiagnosed for it. I'm worried that what if my immune system is failing because i have HIV or cancer. Is this called stress... I don't know what is normal because I've been on edge for years now and I'm scared.I don't know what to do. I go normal for a few days then in a state of panic for another month.

It also hurts to swallow which just went away today. I noticed today when I woke up I didn't have a headache nor was I dizzy but right after I ate breakfast the dizziness and headache came back. Along with all of this I also have very mild aches in my arms and hands from time to time. This has been happening since the 27th so seven days overall. It has not been getting worse but I notice my headaches get worse when I eat the breakfast food at my dining hall. I'm a college student that lives on campus I don't think its a cold because I'm not coughing or sneezing and I don't have a fever. I took a STI test yesterday just to rule out any possibility of me having anything and the results are coming back Monday Tuesday at the latest. I had a boyfriend of 4 months who said he was clean but we still mostly used condoms. The first month we were dating the condom broke during sex and his semen got inside of me. This is what is making me freak out I have something and why I got tested. tldr The past seven days i've had mild body aches headaches with dizziness after I eat and sometimes right in the morning when I wake up. I'm freaking out that I might have HIV because the condom broke while I was having sex with my ex 6 months ago. He told me he was clean but we still made it a habit to use condoms,Anxiety
35089,Hypochondria buddies? This is a repost.Ive either become more aware of my hypochondria or Ive just gotten more anxious about my health which isnt great either way.However I dont really have anyone to talk to about this sort of thing so itd really be nice to have someone to share my worries with and vice versa. Mind you my last post was a fail because I got ghosted so if youre prone to ghosting please dont message me. On that note message me or comment if youre actually interested!,Anxiety
35090,Has anyone had this symptom before.... Last week I did a presentation that I was nervous about and almost couldn't speak because of how dry my mouth became. I drank water but it didn't go away. It's been a week and I still have a dry mouth and my anxiety has been all over the place about it.I go to the doctor in two weeks for my annual so I know that will give me some answers. I'm wondering if its diabetes but my fasting glucose from last year was 82 but I'm not sure. I guess I'm wondering if dry mouth is a common symptom of anxiety I'm not extra thirsty just feeling dry.,Anxiety

35092,I'm so scared because of chest pain I'm a 20 yo female who's always had a high resting heart rate 80115. I am currently on my period so it is possible it could be related to it but I'm not sure. I had a baby over a year ago and still have some milk so I thought this might have something to do with the chest pain. I have a history of acid reflux but I haven't noticed it in about 9 months. The only heartrelated risk factors I know of is just that I'm anemic vape and that I'm about 35ish pounds overweight. The last 2436 hours I've noticed some slight pain on the left side of my chest. It isn't that bad it just feels like its slightly clenching and it makes me nearly have a panic attack everytime I notice it. I first noticed this happening the other night when I got extremely upset and my heart rate went pretty high. Do you think this is anxiety symptoms breast pain or actually heart pain? I'm really scared so any replies are greatly appreciated!,Anxiety
35093,Brain zapschills I started taking vitamin B12 a few weeks ago and I started getting brain zaps. I know they can be caused when coming off antidepressants but Ive never been on them in my life. It feels like chills or like fuzziness in my head like static and I hate it. I dont think Ive ever felt them before and I cant say B12 was the reason why but it all started a few days after taking B12 daily. Its the worst feeling though and I wish it would go away. Even after stopping B12 they still happen now ,Anxiety
35094,How much to say when speaking with your doctor So I have an appointment with my GP tomorrow which I have probably been putting off for too long I feel like the more I see her the less seriously she will take me. I have symptoms that have lasted months or in some cases years only they've gotten worse ones that have lasted weeks and one that just started a few days ago. When I scheduled the appointment I listed the three most worrisome or annoying symptoms as the reason for going in. My question is just... when I actually go to my appointment should I read the dr my laundry list of symptoms or should I just address what I scheduled the appointment for? What do you do when you have many different symptoms? I know that people can have multiple illnesses at once but the fact that my symptoms are in a few different probably unrelated areas makes me worry that my dr will just assume that everything is in my head and yes I'm aware that much of it could be all in my head. I'm also worried that if I mention that all this feeling ill exacerbates my anxiety and that my anxiety exacerbates my feeling ill that she'll write me off as a nut case.Tldr I'm experiencing a lot of probably unrelated symptoms. When I see my doctor should I tell her ALL the symptoms I'm experiencing and risk being taken less seriously or just the most concerning ones? What do you do?I apologize if this was hard to read.,Anxiety

35096,Had a Panic Attack Last Night. Strange Sensation in Head. Anyone Ever Experienced Something Like it Before? Sorry for making another post so quickly after my last one. But I'm in a bad spot right now and I just need to talk about what I'm going through.Last night I had a weird sensation in the left side of my head above the ear. It felt like something was throbbing or pulsating inside my head. It was never painful and it would go away for a few minutes before coming back. I felt it until I went to sleep where I thought something was going to happen to me in the middle of the night or I would die in my sleep.It doesn't help that right now my current paranoia is a brain tumor or a unruptured aneurysm. Earlier this week I had a headache above my left eye around my eyebrow but that went away after a few hours. I've been incredibly anxious about that side of my head.I woke up this morning and haven't felt it again though I've been a nervous wreck all day fearing it would return. It hasn't so far but I think I'm having hypersensitivity in that region cause it feels a bit fuzzy right now.Has anyone else felt something similar to this?Thanks in advance for reading andor commenting.,Anxiety
35097,Losing sleep over losing sleep I might have a stomach ulcer. Maybe probably? I went to a doctor who said I might have an ulcer but didn't do any tests. Two weeks later I went to an urgent care doctor because I had been up 30 hours with discomfort and nausea. They did a blood test and said I was h. pylori negative but I'd been on Prilosec for nearly two weeks and apparently that can affect the test outcome. Was told to keep taking the Prilosec. About a week later I went back to urgent care because I was still losing sleep over nausea. On three or four occasions I have woken up in the middle of the night overheated and needing to vomit almost fainting in the process. I also have pretty consistent abdominal pain across the entirety of my abdomen which worries me because Google says that I'd feel pain only in the middle. I have really bad anxiety and this health crisis has spiraled me into depression as well. I've changed my entire lifestyle in the last month over thisall I eat are carrots potatoes apples peanut butter and yogurt. All I drink is water. Everything I do I scrutinize and I'm horribly afraid something will happen to my supposed ulcer and I'll bleed out especially since I'm away at college and hours from my family. Has anyone dealt with and been officially diagnosed with an ulcer? I'm seeing a specialist in two weeks to hopefully be diagnosed but I'm having a hard time waiting and would like to know if anyone has experienced anything similar.,Anxiety

35099,Weird heart palpitations Hey guys 22 YO male her in pretty good shape. Wanted to post here because lately Ive been having strange heart palpitations and its been giving me anxiety along with shortness of breath. Not sure if the shortness of breath coincides with the anxiety or the heart palpitations but regardless it has been making me really nervous. Any suggestions on what it may be or if theres something wrong with me? Thanks guys.... ,Anxiety
35100,PLEASE reassure me. Do i just have anxiety or heart complicationsangina? I truly HATE Google. Anything I look up comes back with go to the doctor or you will DIE. SYMPTOMSLeftjust as much chance as the right side of my chest has pain. It feels kind of internal and dull. It doesn't feel sharp. It comes and goes. I've been having these night shivers for two to three months now where I shake uncontrollably in my legs and my feet start to sweat sometimes hands not always. I feel better by deep breathing but not shortness of breath while going under the blanket to warm up. I also stick my stomach out and hold an object against my stomach pushing into it. This happens I've noticed when I smoke medical grade marijuana or have excessive sugar like a unhealthy big cake slice and ice cream. It's to the point where I know when it will happen because I get a little light headed and don't feel myself and it will happen 35 minutes later. Recently these chest pains have been occuring. I feel like I'm going to die. After it's over I just WANT to cry or die even if it's gone. I don't really get this from exercise. I can try again but I just ran up four flights of stairs and I feel it but I don't have to sit down or breathe like I can't breathe. It hurts because I think about it! Neck pain sometimes but usually depends how I sleep. Back pain sometimes. Not really arm pain. My gf says no worth going to the doctor cause the bills. My dad says it's in my mind. Neither of them can physically feel what I'm feeling. As I'm typing this I'm fine but if I think about it it will come the way I explained dull just a mild annoyance type of painI'm fucking 23 and healthy. I dance am vegetarian sometimes work out and I really don't deserve this. It gets me SO MAD that this has randomly been happening where I'll punch my chest when it hurts just for the fact that I am so pissed off at myself for having this. It's ruining me mentally and I've always had very bad anxiety. I have panic attacks often now as well around one a day and none if I'm lucky. I used to smoke marijuana a lot and nothing would happen not even these panic attacks. I have recently started a career job but it's a very stressful one where I deal with public transportation and the crazyb commuters. Somebody please I beg to make me feel a little reassured!!!! My dad and his family have diabetes. Last time I went to the clinic three months ago they said I was fine! No blood tests just the blood pressure arm band was used. Is this angina anxiety heart problems?? ,Anxiety

35103,Thinking I might have diverticulitis I don't really like trying to diagnose myself but after living with this unique kind of pain for a few months now I'm trying to stay positive by considering other causes other than defaulting to my mindset that it's cancer.I've been experiencing pain on and off in my lowerleft abdomen. It ranges anywhere from an ache to a burning sensation depending on the day. When it first started happening it got so bad I couldn't sleep on that side. It seems to get worse when the waistband on any of my pants puts pressure in that area.I have already been to the doctor for this before and they took an ultrasound to make sure that it wasn't an ovarian cyst but they found nothing. I also had a CTScan done in that region in July of last year when a kidney stone got lodged in my ureter tube so they didn't find any anomalies in that area either note the pain in my left side only started happening around late November.Eating out too much greasy foods or overeating tends to exacerbate it more. I'm planning on making an appointment just as soon as my husband and I are approved for our onsite assistance program but it might be another couple of weeks until we hear back from them.I'm currently trying to see if limiting my intake to a healthy amount drinking lots of water and exercise helps any.,Anxiety

35107,Weird sensations in head headaches 28MWhite320lbs Blood pressure good 11881 currently dieting and losing weight steadily uncontrolled anxietydepression caused lots of weight gain Currently taking Zoloft 75mg and Metaprolol 12mg half a tablet twice a day as well as magnesium supplements and vitamin b12 supplements.Been suffering with weird sensations in my head since December 11th. Started off getting very mild headaches with pressure in my right temple. Went to Urgent care they ordered a CT scan without contrast which all came back normal. I do suffer from high Anxiety and depression which is why I take Zoloft. The headaches have always been mild and the pressure has never really been severe it just kinda scares me. Doctor put me on metaprolol because he thinks it may be migraines as I also get some auras black dots and what not. The pain also seems to get worse when I lay on my right side that's when the pressure is at its highest. My doctor honestly doesn't seem too worried about it and thinks it's migraines but I don't see why migraines would give me the head pressure. I think it's getting better but it is definitely still there. A couple things I have very outdated glasses and really need a new prescription I also notice lately that I think I'm a pretty bad jaw clincher without realizing it. I might be forgetting some details but one other strange thing is I feel like it was less painful and obvious if I wore a hat but then I wasn't sure if it was caused from hearing a hat beanie so I stopped wearing that.

35108,Suspected lead contamination of sink and dishwasher. Should I be concerned? I needed to clean my car battery terminals so I used some of my measuring cups to make a baking soda solution and scrubbed the battery with an old toothbrush. During the process some of the copper sulfate and probably lead from the terminals made its way into the cups so I rinsed them out and put them in the dishwasher for a couple cycles. I used a dish that was also in the dishwasher at the time later. In hindsight it was an incredibly stupid thing to do but now I'm wondering if I've contaminated my dishes sink and dishwasher with lead particles. I've ordered a lead self test kit but I've been thinking about replacing my dishwasher and sink because of this. Am I just being paranoid or should I be concerned?,Anxiety

35113,Sudden Death at any Moment This is my first post on Reddit so I am unfamiliar with things work however I am here out of desperation.Over a week ago I smoked a THC vape pen a concentrated form of THC. I hadn't smoked weed in around a year and I generally do not like it. I felt nothing for around 10 minutes then it all hit at once and I became very nauseous dizzy began to sweat profuseley and breathe heavily had a panic attack and had to sit down to avoid passing out. I worried I was going to die. I now know that it was a normal reaction to way too much THC called a greenout and I recovered from most of the symptoms after a few days. However while greening out I felt a strange pressure under the skin of my forehead and apparently a red spot formed there temporarily.Most of the symptoms went away. However multiple times a day I feel a light pressure in my forehead still and a few days after that it spread to feel like it was behind my right eye too. No pain just a light pressure that gets worse with exercise. I also feel foggy and dizzy and have ear ringing commonly.I am here because I have an anxiety disorder and have had major issues with health anxiety in the past especially a fear of aneurysms. I forced myself to believe that my symptoms were a result of anxiety but when they didn't go away I went to the family doctor yesterday.I explained things to the doctor and he wasn't sure what to make of it. He said it was likely a tension headache but in his words wanted me to get a CT scan to make sure it's nothing like an aneurysm though he highly doubted it.That made my fears worse. An aneurysm is one of my greatest fears. Worse I have to live with this fear for another week because they can't get me a CT scan until the 12th. The only thing preventing me from freaking out totally is the unlikelihood that I would develop one. I'm a generally healthy non smoking 21 year old male with no known family history of this on either side. The symptoms while they are strange can seem like those of an aneurysm but they're too unclear for me to be sure and could be a number of things. I am keeping in mind my past experiences worrying about health anxiety that came to nothing but it's hard to overcome my fears and symptoms. This past week I have spent in constant anxiety and now I'm too afraid to even walk up the stairs or drink tea or anything that might raise my blood pressure because it might rupture an aneurysm. I think constantly about my own death and have trouble sleeping and eating. I know this makes it worse but I don't know what to do. Ive googled all this heavily I know another bad habit and I can't find any explanations as to what's wrong with me. ,Anxiety

35116,Constant heart anxiety. Ive been lurking on this sub for about two weeks. It all started one morning after shoveling heaps of snow and ice off of my car for about 40 minutes. I got to work and felt a distinct fluttery feeling in my chest several times over the course of an hour or two. That has subsided but for the past two weeks Ive had what I can only describe as a discomfort in my upper left chest that comes and goes. Ive always been the person who googles every single symptom and constantly catastrophizes every situation. So after this incident Ive monitored every ache and pain every strange feeling every random heartbeat that seems too strong or out of place. I am 31f and I have many symptoms of acid reflux and also a great deal of general anxiety. It also doesnt help that I work on my feet moving and lifting things all day long so while I get in a healthy step count daily my arms shoulders back and legs are usually hurting one way or the other.I am scheduling an appointment with my GP but Im hoping to find some reprieve from the constant googling as well as the fueling of my anxiety caused by any minor unfamiliar twinge in my body.

35118,ALS Fear Sending My Life In A Downward Spiral. I don't know where to to turn other then to people who may be able to relate to me. Every second of the day lately I have it in my head that I am going to pass away from ALS shortly. It all started about 1 2 weeks ago. I started having muscle twitches in my right arm and right thigh and when I bend over to pick something up or when I squat my right thigh muscles twitch and tremor uncontrollably. A few google searches later ALS is popping up all over the place. It's been a constant worry now with every 5 10 minutes me getting up out of my chair to test my strength in my right leg. But every time I squat or try to balance on my right leg and bend at the knee the tremors and twitches trigger in my right thigh like crazy. I have really horrible HMO insurance and it takes anywhere from 35 weeks for me to see a Primary Care Physician. I have an appointment for 4 weeks from now with my PCP. But until then all I can do is sit back and hope for the best but expect the worst. I am in in a massive downward spiral now. I can't do anything but sit on my computer and research ALS. I don't want to go anywhere or do anything because in my head I want life to move as slowly as possible just incase I have not a lot of time left on this earth. I don't know where else to turn.

35120,I keep losing my ability to sneeze OK this is a very bizarre one but I've been suffering from this issue on and off for over two years and it's having a big impact on my life. It'd be great if someone is able to shed some light on this. I keep losing the ability to sneeze. Basically I'll get to the ahh but the choo won't happen. I'm not 100 sure but I think it all started when I had some kind of allergic reaction to something in 2016 and I found myself unable to sneeze for at least three weeks. During that time I had quite bad headaches and head pressure. When I finally sneezed the pain instantly disappeared.ampx200BSince then the problem keeps coming back along with the head painpressure I mentioned earlier. I think the longest I've gone without sneezing naturally is three months. Strangely I can force myself to sneeze by tickling the inside of my nostrils with a pointy tissue but that doesn't seem to relieve the head pain. However I can occasionally sneeze if I think about something erotic and fortunately that does relieve the head pain!ampx200BI've researched this problem countless times and I read somewhere that inability to sneeze could be the sign of a brain tumour which seems very unlikely because I would also have more serious symptoms such as an inability to yawn or swallow which I can do perfectly fine. Also the fact that I'm able to FORCE myself to sneeze surely means there's nothing seriously wrong?ampx200BI also read that it could instead be a psychological problem and I honestly think that could be right sometimes when I feel a sneeze coming on it'll come out fine when I'm having a conversation with somebody so it could be that it helps to be distracted from the sneeze instead of worrying about it. I would also like to mention that looking at the light in my bedroom SOMETIMES makes the sneeze come out at the last second despite the fact that I don't think I have the photic sneeze reflex i.e. ability to sneeze without fail by looking at a bright light.ampx200BPlucking my nose hairs can also make me sneeze but I tried that a few days ago and it didn't work. Now I'm sneezestuck again. Hoping someone can help! Thanks.,Anxiety

35123,Intestinal anxiety I'm a 27 year old male I don't smoke in any capacity nor do I do any drugs or drink alcoholic drinks in any capacity. I'm not on any medications and have no pre existing illnesses.Last year I had a pretty large bowel movement large enough that I couldn't pass it without manipulating my anus with my hand to ease the log out since then I've been having blood in my stools on toilet paper and inon feces the blood is red not sure if it's dark red but it's definitely not black. I have no pain associated with passing a stool at all which is slightly comforting I guess...Shortly after the blood started showing up last year I took myself to the ER and explained what was happening after getting a finger up my ass I was told it was most likely hemorrhoids. Not to long after visiting the ER the blood in my stool disappeared and I was relieved now after roughly a year ish later it's shown up again and been off and on for about a month still no pain associated with having bowel movements just anxiety.For the record I have no loss of appetite no weight loss and no fatigue out of the ordinary.

35124,Bone tumor I had been doing so well for a couple years up until recently. I've got a bony lump growing on my sternum over the last two months with pain being present for the past 1.5 months. I had an xray blood test and CT scan. The lump is undoubtably growing and the pain is still there. All the scans and the blood test came back fine the radiologist just noted a sternal notch and everything else was fine there were no suggestions as to what it is or anything. My university doctor doesn't seem to know what it is and just said you may be producing extra cartilage right now. It might be one of these things where you'll have to wait up to 68 months for the pain to go away. How is the pain supposed to go away if this bony lump is still growing and likely won't disappear without surgery?I feel better with the radiologist not being suspicious of the lump but I still feel uncomfortable because no one knows what it is yet and I feel like bone cancer is still kind of in the picture. My sternumsternal joint pain is still here and it has been 1.5 months. I'm making an appointment with my real doctor back home to try and nail this shit down. I'm 22 about to graduate and I really don't need bone cancer to kill me right now.,Anxiety

Chest painaches General info male 21 yr old 150 pounds in weightSo about the last 3 months I've been dealing with extreme anxiety and hypochondria involving fear of something being wrong with the heart and something bad happening in general.

Every time i hear those two diseases or even read them i always get butterflies in my stomach. By the way in the past i have also had worries about my health. I have had worries about my shoulder since it was starting to become numb and the joint clicking exactly in the spot that i had fell on a few years back playing soccer. I also had big worries that i had cubital tunnel syndrome since i was feeling numb in my pinky for two weeks. Another thing to note is that my grandma has always had the same problem about how shes always anxious about her health so i dont know if it could be inherited behavior or something like that. If anyone was wondering i am thirteen and male. Please give me advice.,Anxiety
35127,Is my tailbone supposed to feel like this? I'm kind of freaking out.Recently in the shower while checking my body for signs of anything off as usual I felt my tailbonelower spine and realized it felt totally different than it used to.I have no pain in my lower back or tailbone but the actual bone itself feels strikingly different when I press down and feel it. I've felt my tailbone before and it didn't feel like this.The best way I can describe it is like there are several bony lumps on it when I swear it used to just feel like one single bone bump.Is there a way to accurately tell how tailbones are well supposed to feel?,Anxiety
35128,Health Anxiety? Random abdominal pain scared of going to the doctor and potentially hearing worst case scenario Ive had a LOT going on since Christmas. I lost my grandmother to cancer Ive been sick had a panic attack felt grief out of nowhere for the first time which included pains random anxiety and somewhat a fear of my own health. I had diverticulitis at the end of October last year and it was the first time I realized oh wow. Im not invincible and there are more things than stomach achesWith all of this going on Ive also now started to feel a small pain around my gallbladder. It mainly happens when Im readjusting my position sitting uncomfortably etc. it feels almost swollen and like Im squishing it Im a bigger guy. Ive read things online for relief hoping it was just gas or itd go away on its own. Its definitely gotten better! When its not hurting Id feel a pain in my lower right or on my left side. All of these pains are a 03 max on the pain scale. I cant decide if Im just looking for something wrong or if Im having health anxiety. Im just so scared to go to the doctor because I dont think Ive ever gone and heard good news. It feels like its getting better over time but I wonder if Im over analyzing every pain or feeling I feel now.I know I should go to the doctor but Im scared of going and hearing I have to have surgery or if Id hear hopefully its just irritated from a bad diet and lack of exercise. Lay off fatty foods and take 2 of these a day and youll be all good,Anxiety

35131,Health Anxiety what has worked for me Hopefully it helps you I have health anxiety and it's taken me about 3 years to. It feels good to know that I am not crazy or feel like I am dying from cancer or having a stroke or whatever else it can be. The symptoms are all over the place one month it will be numb limbs the next month my face feels tingly the next month I have shortness of breath then the next month is muscle cramps the next is heart palpitations. Each time I I've been to the doctor so many times its kind of silly. Here are some ways I cope with it. I have days where it's gone mild days and days where it's an episode. I am glad I found this group because it makes me feel like I am not alone. It's hard to talk with people about your health anxiety because most people don't understand. I think it's fine for people to not understand we all I see a CBT therapist I channel my thoughts into something creative painting woodworking reading writing drawing etc. I keep a journal about the symptomsday to day occurrences I listen to classicalcalming music before bed I allow myself to worry for an hour a day In the morning for about 10 minutes I tell myself I am healthy people love me and today will be great you will be ok. I laughtalk about it with my friends not for everyone but it helps me to know that some people have health anxiety at a mild level I note all of the things that happened that have made me feel better and then I repeat them in addition I also write down all of the things that made me feel bad and try to articulate why that make me feel bad. Little to no Caffeine I love coffee but limit myself to drinking coffee on good days. As coffee can sometimes really amplify my symptoms. Little to no alcohol I limit my alcohol intake to social events and never drink on weekdays. I noticed that alcohol while it suppresses my symptoms it makes me into a monster emotionally so I only drink when I am having a good day and not worried about anything. Find a hobby. I like to sail a hobby that requires concentration around the boat and everyone on the boat it helps me be mindful of my surroundings. It's something that has me forget about the symptoms because there is no time. This one took me about a year but I am glad I invested my time into it. This list is a work in progress my recovery has been slow and each month I set a small goal for myself. In the midst of the anxiety it's important to realize that recovery and healing take time it will never happen overnight and I think understanding this and setting very small goals has really helped me. My list above is months of testing out different methods to see what worked for me. Just remind yourself it takes time you are not alone. ,Anxiety

35134,Elevated liver enzymes and elevated protein in blood. Im trippin I had a comprehensive metabolic panel done to see how my potassium level was doing because of two medications I am on yaz and spironolactone.

35135,My mind surprised me even... So heres the story I was hungry and had come home from school. Thought Id workout and order some ol Red Robin from doordash. Fast forward I feel like my driver is taking too long I gave her a call and she sounded nervous and said shed be picking it up in a minute or so even though the app said the food had been picked up. Eventually brought my food about 20 min or so after the call. And now that Ive eaten it for some reason my mind only thought of anthrax... and how my nervous driver could have poisoned my food... So here I am full and satisfied... awaiting the appearance of any anthrax related symptoms and I guess the ol lights out after that... Man I dont think Im ever delivering food again... please someone this sounds crazy!,Anxiety
35136,Mitral valve prolapse anxiety or something else causing these symptoms? Ok so I've been having some issues with my heart for about 6 years I'm turning 19 this year and I've been to the cardiologist 3 times. The first time i went i was told i had mitral valve prolapse and that it was nothing to worry about. The second time i actually went to the er because i was experiencing shortness of breath along with a weird pulse and chestarm pain. The doctor there said it's just anxiety and nothing else and only told me to get some food supplements. After that my symptoms would come and go and about a year and a half i went to the cardiologist i went the first time again. This time she told me i have mitral valve prolapse with leakage to the pulmonary valve and a distention of the aorta in the Valsalva sinus keep in mind I'm trying to translate my doctor's note in English so I might have made some mistakes. Anyway after she finished the echo and the heart ultrasound she told that most of the things i experience are due to MVP and anxiety and that I'm okay but that I should also avoid things like coffee and energy drinks. I'm sure she explained things with more detail but my mind was pretty blank due to the constant anxiety I had these days lol. I still have shortness of breath and some pains in the chest and left arm that come and go along with back pains. I also get heart palpitations and a weird heart rate that is sometimes too fast and other times too slow I went to have a blood test and an ultrasound for my thyroid a month before since my TSH was higher than normal and they came out ok and was told that I should do the tests again after 6 months. I just want to know if i should worry about the other notes my doctor wrote despite my mitral valve prolapse and if these symptoms i experience have anything to do with my aorta or the pulmonic valve leakage or even my high thyroid hormone. Maybe my anxiety makes my symptoms seem so serious and I'm reading into this too much..,Anxiety
35137,Spinning out with health anxiety Hi allNew post struggling big time with health anxiety to the point that it is becoming hard to cope.I'm 36 years old I have two kids currently nursing a 1 year old. About 46 months ago I started losing weight. Initially I thought nothing of it I figured it was just being a busy mom!But fast forward and within that time I caught just the most random viruses and badly. I caught a flu that immediately turned to pneumonia. I caught a viral rash from my 4 year old niece. My weight kept dropping.At this point I started to become understandably anxious and curious as to what was happening. I had bloodwork during my pneumonia that came back normal in her eyes. But I noticed today there was elevated platelet count and low lymphocytes. Which are commonly linked to cancer of some sort. Why did I google it?I'm just spinning out because I lost my dad recently to a very rare aggressive cancer. Something just doesn't add up. I'm just scared that it is something seriously wrong. I'm getting more bloodwork done to hopefully alleviate my worries now that I am healthy... it could just have been related to the pneumonia and the weight loss to nursing anxiety and being a busy mom. But I can't see her until next week and it is just torturous waiting. Any tips on how to cope? Similar experiences?,Anxiety
35138,Strep Throat I don't know. Good eveningSo I just got back from the doctor as I went because I have a bad sore throat. They looked at my throat for what seemed like 5 seconds with just a tongue depressor and told me that nope everything is fine. I didn't even get a swab.I feel really uneasy after this experience and while I think it is just a sore throat myself I almost want to go back and just ask if I can get a swab or something done. I feel like I was brushed off.I'm scared because Strep if left untreated becomes Sepsis and where I am located I have 2 options this one clinic one I visited or waiting in the hospital. I just don't know what to do and I'm getting really worried.,Anxiety
35139,How do I know if its health anxiety or OCD? I obsess over my health A LOT right now. I got over my health anxiety once but now its back since a slight worry of my right hearing actually became true I had a hearing problem in my right ear.While I still worry about these things I also worry about things that are wrong with me in general psychological or not. I'm kind of worried now that my health anxiety might be OCD? I've heard that OCD is harder to treat. OCD is obsessive thoughts as well and I have those with my health. How do I know if it's just health anxiety or if its OCD? Thank you,Anxiety
35140,Why do I feel weak and sick all the time? Freaking out for a month now. Bloodworkuralysis results httpsimgur.comadivyBwVPlease click on the images and expand them before claiming they are too blurry to read. Thank you.Bilirubin was elevated but he said it was just Gilbert's syndrome? He is my new family doctor Canada. Old family doctor would have done all sorts of clinical examination feeling abdomen for things listening to abdomen with stethoscope neurological testing etc. but new doctor barely looks at me.Daily fatigue began last March improved somewhat in September then worsened again in January. I've been experiencing the following symptoms for the past month Muscle weakness hands and legs feel shaky and uncoordinated worried I'm going to drop glasses when I pick them up to drink legs shake while I'm walking up and down stairs etc. Worsens with exertion. Left hand feels weaker than right and sometimes has pins and needles sensation. Extreme drowsiness Brain fog Flushing in legs chest head and what feels like rapid temperature fluctuations from cold to warm. Lower left abdominal pain and discomfort. Nausea and dizziness Feel very hungry much of the time often shortly after eating. Gnawing feeling of hunger. Seem to never gain weight despite eating 4 meals a day. Mild urine retention due to tight bladder neck began 2 years ago diagnosed via cystoscopy in November Infrequent sharp pain near anusrectum Very twitchy eyelids Initially it was only my right eyelid but now my left eyelid twitches as well as eyebrow and upper cheek on right side.Stool is mostly normal but Undigested bits of food in stool Feel like bowels aren't completely voided but can't push the rest out. Feeling goes away after wiping. Stool sometimes broken up into large chunks instead of one long stool Stool sometimes thin and stringySymptoms can be up and down but mostly down and seem to correlate with food on some level although I can't figure out any meaningful pattern. I am unsure which symptoms are connected and which are not. The fatigue and weakness worsens with exertion even just going for walks making exercise difficult. I am a 30 year old male. I weigh 120125lbs and height is 56. I haven't had alcohol in over 4 years and I've never been a heavy drinker. I eat reasonably healthy meals and still maintain a reasonably high appetite in spite of these symptoms.Most distressing symptom by far is the fatigue and weakness. Can barely keep eyes open sometimes and it can feel like I'm tied to a ball and chain.I had an ultrasound and liver workup in addition to the bloodwork above which were apparently normal.Doctor believes I have somatic issues related to anxiety and refuses to do additional testing or refer me to any specialist. I cannot find a new doctor because there is an extremely long waiting list for family doctors. While I begged him for more investigation he practically sat there laughing at me and told me to go find another doctor if I wasn't happy.I am worried and my quality of life is suffering. Should I just keep going to the hospital until they agree to investigate? What should I do?,Anxiety

35144,Anyone have constant vivid dreams with health anxiety? Hello allampx200BI don't even know where to begin. These last few months have been absolutely unforgiving to me. I had three family members pass way in three months. I wish I was making this up. One died in October November and early January. Also in November I was diagnosed with early stage melanoma. Now I already suffer with severe health anxiety however these events have really set me off. I focus on every aspect of my body from my breathing coughs to my abdominal paints to my moles. I have some symptoms that I hope are associated with health anxiety.I have been focusing more on my breathing. Not that I have been having trouble breathing I sleep well but I focus on it more now which makes me think I'm putting in more effort. Also since October I've been having very vivid dreams almost every night never ending ones. And I never wake up feeling like they're good dreams. I feel like all of my fears manifest in these dreams. I have had a vivid dream almost every night for months and I don't know how to get rid of them. I try praying right before I sleep but that doesn't help all the time.I need help ,Anxiety

So this is what happenedIts summer here at the moment were from AusBF was kayaking came across a fastflowing current and flipped his kayak. He was pulled quickly to the surface by his life jacket. Got some water up his nose. He told me about it. Im silently panicking and dreaming out thinking that hes going to die. Here is a bit more extra information about the situation water was fast flowing water was unpleasantly cold we have looked at the water from said river under the microscope before for unrelated reasons and could barely find any bacteria let alone amoeba he has had water go up his nose as a child in a still warmer dam so badly that it went all the way into his throat and it didnt affect him.

35148,Rabies Scare So I came upon a branch that had some porcupine quills embedded in it and was stupid enough to pull a few out to get a better look. A managed to poke myself in the finger with one it didn't go very deep no blood and I pulled it out right away.Anxiety reared its head and I was suddenly worried about exposure to rabies. I did call urgent care to see what they said. They didn't know the answer right away and had to do a bit of research. The verdict that came back was porcupines don't carry rabies so you should be fine. I wasn't particularly confident in this assessment since porcupines can like most mammals carry and transmit rabies. I'm wondering if she was just referring to the quills.Any way I'm still kind of freaking out Rabies does not seem like a fun way to go.Any reassurances? I'm sure people have been stuck with quills before without getting rabies right?,Anxiety

Ive been having BPD flair ups all day and around night time i was eating dinner stir fry with vegetables soft ones. i had a feeling that a soft veggie peel got stuck in my throat. no matter what i did it wouldnt come out. Long story short trigger warning for some..i made myself throw up to get it out. I saw some come out but then my throat still felt like there was a lump in it. I called a nurse and she said as long as i am breathing and can swallow which i always could im fine but its just feeling like there something stuck and that ill choke in my and die.

35151,Gotta love anxiety. My hypochondria has actually been in check for the last few months because Ive been so busy and had no time to even think about anything besides schoolwork. As of lately life has been incredibly stressful and I ended up getting the flu. Due to the stress it caused my period to be late which stressed me even more. Then all the sudden I got a minor ache in my groin area where i think the lymph nodes are located. I thought I felt it swollen but couldnt really tell as I was pushing pretty hard to feel something that Im sure my anxiety wasis causing. Anyone have experience with swollen lymph nodes in the groin area? When theyre swollen is it clear and unquestionable that they are? Its only the left side Im experiencing it. I noticed if Im occupied I dont have any kind of ache. Stupid anxiety. If I could go to the doctor I would. It would ease my fear. But unfortunately money is tight and insurance doesnt come cheap.,Anxiety

35154,anxiety over leg numbness so i've had crippling anxietyhealth anxiety for 2 years now. it's been such a torture in my life and i still havent gone to see a therapist mostly financial reasons. but anyway two nights ago my left leg started feeling restless while i was lying in bed and i didn't think much of it and went to bed with no problem. i woke up forgetting about it until i remembered and the feeling came back even worse. it feels like how your limbs feel after they fall asleep and you wake them up slightly numb and tingly and sometimes it feels kinda like how your legs burn after you exercise. this has been going on for two days and it's caused me so much panic because i automatically think its DVT. it was so bad that last night i had the worst panic attack i've ever had and i legitimately could not breathe. i took a xanax and i could breathe again and went to sleep but i've been dealing with it all day and my breathing has been hay wire today which is especially great since DVT can lead to pulmonary embolism which is shortness of breath so lol.... i'm going to the doctor tomorrow but i'm scared as hell. i'm trying to convince myself it's just a pinched nerve but it's so hard. i really hate living like this because i'm not even living at all.,Anxiety
35155,Excited to find this community I have a phobia of having a heart attack and dying. I am a 31 year old woman and I have a fear of dying from a heart attackstroke. Every time I have a back pain arm pain jaw pain nausea or uncomfortable chest feelings I get worried its signs of a heart attack. Ive talked to my GP about and she just told me Im too young to worry about that my bloodwork came back normal in October 2018. I havent had any deaths in my immediate family who have heart attacks but one of my grandfathers had a stroke and an uncle had some heart issue when he ended up getting a pace maker. Ive eaten horrible since I was a kid and am trying to change my habits now cutting out red meat working out but I feel like what if Im too late? I mean I was that kid whose parents got them McDonalds all the time. Im not overweight but I am at the high end of my normal BMI for my height. I just wish I could take a straight forward test to tell me if my arteries are getting close to getting clogged. I smoke marijuana too and yes there are some times where it makes me more paranoid so Im going to try to switch to an herbal vape. It feels good just to get this all out. ,Anxiety
35156,Diabetics Ketoacidosis and Brain Cancer Hi I'm new here. I started having very mild health anxiety when I was younger but it recently increased the last few months. In December I went to the ER due to chest pains because I was sure I was having a heart attack even though I was terrified. I went to the doctor and they said it was just acid reflux and they sent me home with a prescription. After that I had to followup with my PCP and she told me there was an abnormality in my EKG my second one and referred me to a cardiologist to do an echocardiogram. That same week I was worrying about every little ache and symptom that I've read about heart attacks and kept manifesting each one. It sucked because I didn't feel like it was all in my head and I kept freaking out. Mind you I'm a college student away from home which made everything worse. Winter break came and I went home. I didn't feel any symptoms and I wasn't worried about my health anymore. Then I came back to school last month and my friend had a stroke. She's 19 so I was surprised at how young she was to be having a stroke. This event stirred up my past anxieties about my heart and I found myself checking my heart rate often throughout my day again. I would also google every possible heart condition that I could have that I wouldn't know of. The next week I finally got my echocardiogram done and the doctor said it was completely normal which eased my mind at little bit. That same week I had on and off nausea which I was sure was because of how anxious I was about my health. The next few days go by and I start having tension headaches or so I think. They were on and off as well but it just hurt to the point where I was convinced I had brain cancer. With the nausea and the headaches I just assumed. I tried to refrain from googling the symptoms because I knew it would elevate my worries but I couldn't resist. The last few days I've been so worried about having brain cancer because I wouldn't be able to focus and some things were hard to remember but there is no family history of any type of cancer so I kept trying to focus on that. Now I am currently worrying that I have Diabetic Ketoacidosis. I have no family history of diabetes and I've never been told that I should watch out for it because I am 18 normal weight and have been healthy. But lately I've been stress eating because of how anxious I've been and food makes me feel a little better. However I always feel guilty right after eating and it makes me feel sick to my stomach. I just don't know how to cope with this anymore and I have a doctor's appointment next week so hopefully she can ease my mind a bit more. ,Anxiety
35157,what are the early symptoms of Colon cancer? 23 yrs old worried so much My stomach has been having some problem for a month now it started from a sharp sting pain in my upper middle abdomen I was checked for a possible of ulcer but turned out negative and took some ultrasound but everything is normal I was given a Omeprazole and some antacid syrup Aluminium hydroxide dried gel Magnesium hydroxide and it worked. I changed my diet but after some time my upper left side of my abdomen begins to hurt every time I finished my food and it will go away if I release a gas or burp but moving to this week I feel suddenly feel a discomfort in my stomach I feel that it is filled with air and every time I release a gas its turns ok then after a half an hour it will the discomfort will begin again. I started to search for some symptoms relating to what I'm experiencing and it kind of leads me to colon cancer though I'm not sure how to examine myself on bloody stool and I haven't experience vomit nor nausea. All the test was done on a clinic I really want to do an endoscopy to make sure so I suggested to my parents to have it checked in a hospital since we have insurance even if we live in a different country but they told me to wait and have it checked in a hospital during my vacation to our home country which is 1st week of March but I can't wait that much because of the symptoms and its giving me some worries ,Anxiety

35159,The cycle starts again I'm diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder but only this year have i experienced the terror of health anxiety. I went through a throat infection which I of course thought was cancer at first I spent hours rechecking and researching my symptoms which started to completely take over my life. I couldn't go a second without a distraction. After the infection cleared up I was basically rid of my fears. Except a few days ago I had an incredibly terrifying panic attack. I was just lying in bed and I had this faint pain in my left arm and for some reason my brain just short circuited I jumped up my heart started racing which led me to think I was having a heart attack. I genuinely thought I was going to die I felt dizzy and for the first time I couldn't calm myself down. I was terrified so I went to see my mother and I just crawled into her arms like a 20 year old baby and after a few minutes everything went back to normal. And now I'm back in the cycle again. Asking myself what if that WASN'T a panic attack? and other completely illogical questions. I keep checking my heart beat sometimes I get a spike of anxiety when I think it's too slow and same for when i believe it's too fast. I can't break out of this and it's taking over everything I'm so scared and so sick of living like this does anyone have any advice on how to just make my brain chill for like just a second?,Anxiety
35160,Im probably crazy I used to have horrible HA and for whatever reason it stopped I think I was so busy that I didnt have time to think about it.However I just went to get a routine std checkup and I kinda mentioned in passing that Ive been itchy everywhere not just crotch reason. Keep in mind Ive had dry skin my whole life and my parents said I used to always itch when I was a kid. So in passing the nurse decided to mention the potential for SCABIES and like a switch my mind started racing. I knew very little about scabies and now I swear I have them. The areas of my body that tend to itch are my sides and crotch region also my arms and shoulders. However through my frantic googling and recent discovery of this subreddit I now think its diabetes. Im going to a derm on Tuesday to check for scabies even tho I now changed my mind on what it is.Keep In mind I didnt think anything of it until this nurse said something! She didnt even check me out either to see.,Anxiety
35161,Intense bought of health anxiety for the first time in quite a while. I recently started on an SSRI and have been doing fairly well for the past few weeks thoughts related to my health anxiety are present but I have been able to drive the worries away quickly. This morning was different.I had just woken up and was laying in bed when I had a random thought my chest feels fairly still. Normally I'm very aware of my heartbeatdue to anxiety I think. I place my hand over my chest and realize I can't feel my heartbeat. I check my wrist and I can't feel it either. I immediately get sent into a panic attack and jump up and start pacing furiously hand over my chest. Now logically I know that if my pulse has stopped I wouldn't be able to jump up pace around etc.however I just can't shake that sense of impending doom. When pacing I can feel my fluttering heartbeat but now when I'm sitting down again I can't feel it. I made the mistake of looking up why I might not be able to feel my pulse and read that a weak pulse is considered a medical emergency so now I'm absolutely paralyzed with fear. Has anyone had any experience with this? Am I in real danger or is this my overactive brain sending me into a panic over nothing at all? ,Anxiety
35162,Wearing a monitor for two weeks... any tips to take your mind off of it? My cardiologist has me wearing a small monitor for two weeks as my palpitations tend to be sporadic. Even though its small and just sticks to my chest its been one day and its driving me nuts. Im always aware that its there and thats making my anxiety and ironically my palpitations worse just knowing its recording everything. Trying to sleep last night was awful so now I know my anxiety will be worse today.Has anyone worn one for awhile and do you have any tips for trying to take your mind off of it?,Anxiety
35163,I think I am a textbook case of health anxiety. So this all starts about 5 weeks ago. I had strange discomfort in my side's and went to the gp when they didn't seem to get better. She ordered a full blood work and also gave me a physical examination. Bloods came back completely fine with only a slightly elevated pancreas enzyme base is 100 mine was 107 and for some unknown reason to myself and to the doctor I convinced myself I had pancreatic cancer. Ever since the discomfort has shifted from my side's to the top of my abdomen and I obsess over every little niggle I feel. I'm constantly poking at my glands in my neck 5 years ago i also convinced myself I had lymphoma and now I'm checking every little thing my body does. They gave me CA19.9 blood test used to detect tumour growth in pancreatic cancer cases and mine was 6.1 normal health person is between 135 so that should have made me feel better it didn't. They then sent for an ultrasound which showed everything looks exactly like it should. I've literally heard from 6 doctors now mostly at the accident and emergency department they are 99.9 I don't have pancreatic cancer and that I probably have gastritis. So I'm getting a camera down my throat next month to test for that. No matter how many times they said I was ok I just keep thinking they're wrong. Something is wrong. I know my body and this doesn't feel right. I did loose some weight and my appetite went away but has since come back. So how they're throwing all these anti anxiety drugs my way Diazapam 10mg Propanalol 10mgOlanzapine 20mg 10mg and 5mg depending how bad I feel at the time I'm not having restful sleeps constantly struggling to distract myself. I just want some advice. The kind of advice from someone who's been through this rabbit hole.... I just don't know what to do... I'm sorry if the post makes little sense I'm writing it on my phone and I'm not the most educated person in the world.I should also note I've been suffering from social anxiety since I was 10. Thank you for your time.,Anxiety
35164,Scared of Pulmonary Embolism Hey guys so the past few days or so I've been very worried about a PE. Today was especially bad with a pain on the right side of my back below my shoulder that was like a pulsating pain with my heart beat. It went on throughout the day and aspirin didn't help every time I made a small adjustment I'd get the pains. Then suddenly when I came home they went away but about half an hour ago I felt a sharp pain on the left side of my back that felt like it also hurt in my chest. I've kind of been on edge since then and have been experiencing various sharp pains in my chest. I went to the doctor today and they took my blood pressure and pulse which were normal and the doc listened to my heart yesterday and it was fine. Would these seem off if I did have a PE? Can anxiety cause these sharp pains they don't feel like surface level pains,Anxiety
35165,Heart Failure? Male 17ampx200BAbout 6 months ago i had my first panic attack. This was accompanied with palpitations and i was shaking very bad. I thought i was having a heart attack. I conitnued having these panic attacks but I understood that I wasn't having one heart attack every day so I tried convincing myself it was anxiety. I went to see a doctor after a while just to make sure nothing was wrong with me and I got a referal to the hospital to have a 24h EKG taken. I did and they noticed some extrabeats. My heart rate was also pretty high for short periods during these 24 hours for unexplained reasons. I assume anxiety. I recently got another referal to a cardiologist and I am going to do a lot of different tests to make sure that nothing is wrong. I got the referal to the cardiologist 2 weeks ago but I haven't recieved a letter phone call or anything. So who knows how long it will take? I recently started having a cough. It feels like theres some wet thing stuck in my throat and I clear my throat all the time. I can sometimes feel it in my lungs as well. This accompanied with shortness of breath. Now I have managed thanks to the help of Dr. Google to diagnose myself with Congestive Heart Failure. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? I am starting to lose patience.,Anxiety
35166,Underside of my jaw is more swollen on one side than the other? I'm so scared Hey guys not sure what I'm looking for here. I'm home alone don't have anyone to talk to and am freaking out.I don't know how to explain it but I'll do my best so. Behind my chin underneath my jawline one side is more swollen than the other when I tense my neck muscles. I first discovered it when I was prodding my neck it's very pronounced when I tilt my head to the side. I tilted my head to the left tensed my muscles and it felt like a huge mass under my jaw. I can feel a similar shape on the left side of my neck but it's nowhere near as big. It looks big in the mirror too. When I'm relaxed I can't feel anything. There is no pain and I haven't found any lumps but I'm really starting to panic now. My mam comes back from holiday on Monday so I'll have her feel it. I don't want to go to the doctor because I just had a totally harmless cyst needlessly removed because I was convinced it was dangerous and I don't want him to think I'm hysterical which I am to be fairI'm pretty sure it's always been like this but I seem to be having a bad anxiety flare up. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? I'm really going insane here!,Anxiety
35167,Worried about diagnosis I've been having some issues with my heart for the last 4 years I'm turning 19 this year. By that I mean I'm having symptoms like heart palpitations shortness of breath pain in my chest left arm back and dizziness. Every time I went to my cardiologist I was told I had mitral valve prolapse and that my symptoms were caused by anxiety. I wasn't given anything about my prolapse. However the last time I went to my cardiologist she said that along with my MVP I also have a leakage on my pulmonary valve and a distention of the aorta in the Valsalva sinus I'm actually trying to translate my doctor's note in English so there might be some mistakes. She said that I should avoid things like coffee and energy drinks and that I'm okay. She also said I must go for an exam every 2 years. She didn't really explain if my symptoms are solely from anxiety however.That's actually why I'm writing this post to see if those other conditions beside MVP mentioned in my doctor's note are serious because I can't get it out of my mind these days. I've lately been experiencing dizziness shortness of breath chest pain and heart palpitations and I can't figure out if these are caused by anxiety or something more serious.. I'm also worried about my aorta and the possibility of me having an aneurysm after reading the note.,Anxiety
35168,Relatively new anxiety causing constant fear of testicular torsion Hey so I know this sounds just ridiculous but ever since I learned about this happening I keep on thinking that it will happen to me. It's lost me sleep I have lost appetite and I end up thinking about it way more often than I'd like to and I don't know how to stop. My anxiety has started relatively recently but it's been very strong and it's honestly been the most frustrating thing I've ever had to deal with. Any advice on either assuring myself that nothing is wrong or anything else?,Anxiety

35171,Increasing exercise triggers HA? Ive had anxiety for many years. I havent been on meds in a few years because I felt like I could manage it better. Up until now!

I'm not sure if I post in the right subredditampx200BI suddenly recall being paralyzed when I was a 1st grader.Well i remember that one morning I woke up climbed down the bed and flop I was on the floor. I was thinking that well maybe i'm just sleepy. And I couldn't stand up no matter how hard I tried. So I cried out really loud. I forget the detail but i was just a kid and not very heavy to begin with so my parents have to carry me to school. And yep I sat at my own seat all day and couldn't attend the school weekly meeting in the school yard. My parents had to make me take the blood test. I remember crying and trying to crawl out of the hospital desperately like some injured soldier. But no sequelae. It all ended after a week. I just wonder what the hell could happened to me that time.,Anxiety

35177,Throat ear stuff going on Im having the worst day.. Ive been having random symptoms that have triggered me in a huge way.I had a bad bout of colds for almost two months and when I finally recovered I felt like I had a grain of rice in the back of my throat. Now Im prone to tonsil stones and noticed a bit come out but the feeling was still there. It almost feels as though one is lodged deep and I cant get to it or see it. Additionally Ive had some dull ear pain off and on. I went to urgent care and the doctor got out a tiny bit of something in the back of my throat but it didnt resolve it completely. She said my throat looked healthy but I still worry she missed something. Today I made the stupid mistake of checking my throat for the billionth time and noticed a white patch In the back of my throat and went down a google spiral. I feel so anxious its hard to function. I have a little baby and he deserves better than what Im giving him right now. I feel like a failure and yet I cant break out of this vicious cycle. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms? I did make an ent appt and Im scared shitless. ,Anxiety

HA is fucking expensive and thats almost as stressful as the symptoms.,Anxiety
35179,A story about my anxiety in the recent past and issues i'm facing today a little long As my title says I've been having an intense battle with anxiety lately. I have anxiety and depression that I was treating with Zoloft until the end of last February. I am a 21 year old male that lives in the Midwest.1. Last YearAround midjune of last year I had started to get some insomnia the kind that wakes you up early which I then blamed on the fact that my basement room is incomplete and family upstairs made a lot of noise. I also had brain fog with all the complications that accompany it which I had blamed on my lack of sleep. It sucked but I decided I should wait for my mind to improve on their own. During this time I had a slight but long lasting bit of anxiety about something unrelated.During this time I decided to drink 30ml of Zzzquil before bed in order to help me go to sleep quicker and I would sometimes take a sip of it if I had woken up too early.2. A few months agoI lived with everything until midDecember in which I started to have pain in my testicles and prostate as well as my upper back and in random parts of my body. Long story short I started to get intense anxiety about possible cancer. In order to slightly control it I stopped drinking coffee every day and quit smoking weed once a week. Eventually I had an ultrasound and a CT scan done which found nothing. The symptoms associated with my lower region faded a couple of days after.At some point along the way I started having more symptoms such as forgetfulness possible confusion numbness and tingling in my hands and feet a feeling of dizziness or vertigo a slight shaky feeling in my upper left arm and what I can only describe as brain zaps. I also felt like my memory was getting a lot worse. These symptoms seemed to persist even on days when the anxiety seemed less bad. I made the mistake of googling my symptoms and good old brain cancer showed up. I pushed my doctor to give me an MRI which later turned up nothing.3. A few days agoOver the time after I got the MRI results back the anxiety seemed to come down from a constant 58 to a 23 on a scale from 010 and while a couple of symptoms seemed to disappear over the next week and a half I started to get new ones such as random twitches and fasciculations in random varying parts of my body which I blamed on drinking coffee again and trouble going to sleepgetting woken up in the middle of the night which I blamed on weaning myself off of the Zzzquil I had mentioned before. When I started to go to sleep or wake up I would also have thoughts that would make no sense. I still have these symptoms today which is my motivation for writing this post.I confess I still worried about things like spinal cancer and whether or not anything was actually wrong with me aside from the anxiety so I made the same mistake of googling again last wednesday. This time I came across brain prion diseases specifically vCJD which threw me in to another state of panic and anxiety possibly even greater than the last couple. 4. Today and the futureThis time I'm worried that it might be the real deal despite the hilariously low odds I have of actually having it. The worst part is rationally I know I probably don't have what I'm so scared of. Luckily I had a doctor's appointment the next day after my latest googling mistake and they set me up with a sort of behavioral counselor as well as having me start on a different antidepressant.I guess what I'm seeking by writing this post is reassurance that I won't be a clinically insane mess of a human due to some brain issue in 6 months. I'm constantly auditing my environment past experiences and my own thoughts in order to make sure I'm not hallucinating or something like when I woke up around a week ago in the middle of the night to the smell of something burning which could have just been my heater I just feel skeptical sometimes that ALL of the symptoms I'm feeling or have felt can be due to solely anxiety when it's never been this bad before.The past few months have made me mentally tired due to having to put up with the stress of daily life in addition to everything above. The insomnia and the anxiety have definitely taken a toll on me. I just hope it actually is just anxiety and nothing serious.,Anxiety
35180,Posting to maybe calm my worries... So obviously I like most likely all of us here suffer with abit of health anxiety. I'm just wondering if i'm being a hypochondriac when I think I'm dying because I have small bumps underneath my skin on my forearm that seem to run along my vein are they normal? does everyone else have them? maybe you yourselves could check and if you do I guess I'm fine... or we're all doomed... jk but seriously ,Anxiety
35181,Fell on ice and hit my head Basically like the title says I was walking to the bus stop and I fell and hit my head pretty hard. Felt like I was gonna stay on the ground for a good bit. Didn't lose consciousness I think as I made it to the bus on time. I'll be home in around three hours but I'm terrified. Back then my vision was blurry and walking was a bit difficult. My balance is a bit better now but the blurry vision part still scares me. My head hurts. I took a few pain killers and wrote my mom who told me to sleep and rest a bit but I'm terrified that maybe I need help asap and sleeping will just end with me passing out. Google as always never helps and I also think I might have like a small amount of internal bleeding or something. I'm struggling to stay calm. How should I go about this? Scared that this dumb concussion might be the end of me.,Anxiety
35182,Shortness of breath whole day Have this feeling I cant breathe and struggles in inhaling air . Also searched the internet about it and they gave me lots of nasty disease like TBanemia and Gi bleeding so i took some iron supplements to maybe replenish my iron. Everytime I go to school and have this feeling it makes me think im about to die any minute.,Anxiety

And what about other stds?,Anxiety
35185,Very small red lump underneath armpit Just a bit of a background I have always been very self conscious of my health from worrying about the smallest symptoms to convincing myself I had ALS disease. Anyways today after a good hour and a half workout I noticed right after a slight discomfort underneath my left armpit. I looked to check it out and there was a very small red bump that is somewhat tender to the touch. I don't know if this is just something minor like a pimple cyst etc. Keep in mind I stared to mysteriously break out on my face with two pimples just this morning which is quite rare. Or could it be a lymph node that has gone rouge. Everywhere else on my body seems normal just this one spot on my armpit. Ive been down this road before in the past so im not freaking out about anything yet. Just wondering if anyone else in here has had something similar to this?,Anxiety
35186,How can I function? Bit of background. I suffered with anxiety about 4 years ago. General stress induced anxiety and then it spiraled out of control. I convinced myself I had skin cancer and made my doctor check me all over. I am fine but was told to keep an eye on my moles. Ok. No changes in 4 years. Anxiety continued and I took medication for it. Since then I have returned to normality and no longer take meds. I have a smear test coming up soon and I don't know how I am going to cope between the test and the results. I know it is going to trigger my health anxiety and I do not know how I will function such as getting up and going to work. 4 years ago I was in such a bad place with my health anxiety I stayed in bed for weeks and was physically sick with worry. How can I cope while I wait for the results?,Anxiety
35187,DAE get bruises that just pop up and you don't know where they came from? I noticed a big one today on the side of my elbow on my right arm then a couple smaller ones on the front of my other arm then a couple more on my right arm again.,Anxiety

35189,Anyone know much about alcohol? Ok so similar to a lot of people with anxiety I use alcohol at times to cope with anxiety. Bad I know but medication didn't work for me. So I've been drinking a fair amount most nights but decided it's definitely time to cut down. I have been worried about cutting down in case of fatal withdrawal symptoms however I haven't had a drink since Friday night and I think I feel fine? Is it possible that I could just have been enjoying alcohol rather than be addicted? I would still like to drink once a week if I could. ,Anxiety
35190,Just feel so overwhelmed over ultrasound. Pleas talk to me. Long story short is that i went to the DRs to get routine bloodwork done after stressing for a month i also had her check my thyroid and hormones because after having irregular periods and feeling anxious i figured that hormones had to be it. My blood work came back fine except my testosterone was high. I started having a work up done on my ovaries and kidneys to check for tumors. My friend is a nurse at the office i was at and had the ultrasound tech check my kidneys extra well even tho it wasnt a dedicated test for them because she knew i was afraid of a adrenal tumor. The tech couldnt find anything and said if there was something there she would of seen it...but that wasnt good enough of a answer for me. I have to go back for a kidney bladder ultrasound and Im spiraling out of control because i feel like THATS when theyre going to find something. I cant take it. I feel like my life is unbelievably overwhelming now and Im too scared to go back to have the ultrasound. Please...anybody. An ultrasound tech or nurse or anyone with a similar experience. Please help me. I dont want to live like this. ,Anxiety
35191,Scared of heart pumping problem My mom developed cardiomyopathy inadequate pumping due to weakening of the heart muscle when I was 8 or 9 I'm 21 now. Since then she's been on medicines and her condition has improved significantly in last 12 years. A few years ago I started having heart palpitations which were more noticeable after I did some exercise. I was af and my parents took me to the ER but they said it's just anxiety but as my mom has this condition I should get it checked out. We went to the cardiologist the next day who ran some tests like ECG Echo and bloodwork and everything came out normal. After a few months I stopped noticing the symptoms even while exercising. I still get palpitations when I'm going through a phase of anxiety but rarely otherwise. Out of curiosity I surfed the internet about cardiomyopathy and came to know that a person has 50 chance of inheriting the faulty gene from their affected parent and I'm really scared now. The articles even mentioned that in some cases the first diagnosis comes to light when a family member dies suddenly due to cardiac arrest. I'm really scared now of developing this disease now or in the near future and I don't really know what I can do about it. I want to mention one more thing that my mom's heart pumping has come back to normal but she still takes the medicine because a condition is a condition so the prognosis is good in her case. ,Anxiety
35192,Hearing loss At what point do I talk to my doctor about not being able to hear well. I've noticed more and more struggling to hear. Last time I asked she said I just had fluid in my ear and said it would be fine. It's been 6 months since then and I've switched doctors because of her being dismissive on other things. Rolling eyes laughing at me etc. I had the flu between then and now. And after the flu it seems like it had gotten a lot worse. And being in public with hearing issues is making my anxiety skyrocket. What really scares me even more is my mom had a tumor removed from her ear area that was causing hearing loss. What do I do? Can anyone comfort me? Is this a reason to go to the walk in or do i need to make a regular appointment? I would of talked to the doctor the 8th but I've had such horrible times with doctors I ended up cancelling because I was having such bad anxiety attacks. I ordered pizza instead to calm myself it didn't help I'm not on any anxiety medication. Or anything but birth control. ,Anxiety
35193,High blood pressure spike Does anyone else have high blood pressure? I can never tell if my high blood pressure causes my anxiety attacks or the other way around. I guess its not possible to know. I just ate fast food for the first time in a while which seemingly cause my blood pressure to spike. My heart rate was up as if I was on a brisk walk for an hour despite just sitting and doing deep breathing exercises. It was probably just all of the excess sodium but I just couldnt calm myself back down for anything. I know that digestion in general will cause a higher heart rate but when my head starts to feel hot and tight like a balloon I just have a hard time shaking the idea that something bad is about to happen.Doing fine now just thought Id share in case anyone has a similar thing. This too shall pass,Anxiety
35194,Canker sore in back of my throat Crohn's disease 19 yo male I had my first canker sore last summer near my tonsils and now I have another one. I have always had problems with my stomach docs gastroscopied me in 2016 because I had nausea and heartburn almost 247. Biopsies and everything came back normal never gotten colonoscopied though. In my mind these canker sores are a symptom of crohns disease and it must mean I have it. I just can't figure out any other explanation than that thanks to hypochondria. My stomach problems were pretty bad years ago and I thought I had colon cancer or something like that. Nowadays I feel a lot better but the thing is that if something comes up that might be a symptom of IBDCrohnsColon cancer I almost instantly think I have it.,Anxiety

35196,Sore gland in neck for six days feeling so down with this anxiety. Just need to vent. I've had this problem on and off for a while where it'll flare up for a few days and then go away for a while. I have no idea what triggers it. It's always the left side of my neck under my jaw. I'm assuming it's a lymph node but I can't feel anything when I feel around in that area. But the pain is very localized to that one spot when I press on it or turn my head it'll hurt right there. It also hurts when I swallow but not in a sore throat way more like something is bumping against that inflammation and irritates it. I might go to the walkin clinic today because I'm sick of worrying about it. I have no other symptoms besides a small headache between my eyebrows which started up about two days ago and has stayed pretty constant. It feels like a sinus headache but I don't have the other symptoms besides my typically slightly stuffy nose. Trying to stop obsessing over lymphoma since I know that causes painless nodes and swelling. I just hate that I'm having this for seemingly no reason. I'd feel BETTER if I had a cold because at least then I'd understand the pain came from that. God. I feel like I've had one thing after another for the past six months. ,Anxiety
35197,Mid back pain anxiety About 3 months ago I woke up with a slight pain half way up my back in my spine and just off to the right of my spine. Felt like low grade stabbing pain.Of course I immediately thought of the c word. Since then I have noticed the pain move around and change slightly. Now it is like an ache in my thoracic spine. I also get painful tight neck pain. And I still have ongoing low back pain with sciatica since about 18 months.My physiotherapist says he doesn't think it is anything serious and to just train harder in the gym.I have basically resigned myself to the fact that I am dying.But on good days I think it is a vicious circle of stress and anxiety manifestation in my back.Anyone else get these symptoms?,Anxiety
35198,Had a heart attack scare and now my anxiety is through the roof Hi! I posted this in ranxiety as well but i thought id post here too hope thats ok!So on Friday night I was rushed to the emergency department because I was having severe chest pain to the point where I couldn't even talk I was just crying. I didn't know what it could be and it didnt even cross my mind that it could be anything to do with my heart. The pain eased up after and hour and after around 6 hours when I finally got seen by a doctor the pain was non existent. I explained the issue to the doctor and he told me he wasn't really worried about me seeing as I'm an otherwise healthy 20 year old but he decided to run an ECG anyway. The ECG came back showing changes in my heart rhythm that mimicked that of a heart attack and so he decided to take some blood to check. After about 2 hours he came back to me telling me that the blood test came back negative and that I hadn't had a heart attack it was probably just a panic attack and that I could go home.Now it's a few days later and my brain wont stop going over the experience. I keep thinking something is wrong or that the doctor missed something. I keep getting chest pain and shortness of breath but my family are insisting it's anxiety after the whole experience. I dont know what to do I don't feel like myself at all and I dont want to go anywhere or do anything which is the complete opposite of how i usually am and I've completely lost my appitite. I don't know how to shake the fact that this wasn't an actual heart attack and that I'm actually okay. I just feel completely broken and terrified. I'm sorry if this is a lot or this is the wrong place I just felt like I had to write it down and maybe get some advice about what to do to make everything seem better.TLDR I had a heart attack scare and although results eventually came back saying I hadn't had a heart attack I can't stop thinking somethings terribly wrong. ,Anxiety
35199,Weird vision Hey guys. Ive had health anxiety for a while but yesterday Ive had a new experience which freaked me out. As I was getting ready for sleep my vision suddenly changed. I was seeing colors and felt as though i opened my eyes underwater. There were areas in my vision that were blurry and had lines on them. I tried to close my eyes but nothing changed. I fell asleep eventually and woke up an hour later with a headache. Went back to sleep and in the morning everything was fine. However Im on the edge because im scared it will happen again. Did it ever happen to you? Is it cause of concern? Thank you. Im really freaked out right now,Anxiety

35201,can someone tell me its really difficult to get diabetes? HeyI have been very anxious about possibly having diabetes for a while now. I am a bit overweight and dont exercise often. My eyesight has been declining over the past years and my family has no history of diabetes. so there is nothing to be alarmed about. However i keep thinking i have it every little sign makes me freak out. A few days ago I found some mold in my toilet and immediately assumed it was because of the glucose in my urine or something. Can someone please give me some positive assuration or facts about the odds of getting diabetes due to being overweight? I think if I get told that you dont just develop diabetes for no reason my anxiety would decline a lot. ,Anxiety
35202,Mucus in Stool and Anxiety Do you guys have white mucus in your stool? I'm very anxious and very often worry about my health. As the rest of you here I survived numerous illnesses diseases and I always worried about them without real reason. In the last 2 years I have some white mucus with every stool. Sometimes barely noticeable sometimes more. Of course I'm freaking out and think about IBD cancer and the worst possible outcome. However I don't have any other symptoms. No abdominal pain no blood. I even don't fit into IBS those guys have much more troubles than me. If this is IBD or cancer I'm pretty sure I wouldn't feel well and would have more symptoms. I'm also one of those guys who afraid to be diagnosed thus I didn't visited a doctor yet. I had periods when I managed to convict myself that I'm fine and during that periods I have very small amounts of mucus. But a few days ago it become more noticeable then I started to examine my poops and freaked out. Of course now I have more and more of it. I'm curious if this could be my anxiety only? Do you guys ever noticed mucus in your stool?,Anxiety
35203,SO HAPPY I FOUND YOU ALL So i have been agorohobic and having panic attacks for 6 months now. I have SEVERE health anxiety and would LOVE TIPS.So basically I have chest pains not in the heart area. It's like far left under breast. Sharp pain sometimes I've had ekgs and blood tests and physicals. I cannot get over the fact something is wrong. Everyday. I'm afraid if I throw up I'm going to die. So being nauseous is my biggest fearI go to doctors every other week to get evaluated and I always get sent away. Sometimes I break down and just start to cry and say I can't die now. I'm so young. Please. I can't die. Help me. I don't want to die. over and over again becuase my toe hurts.I'm in therapy and working on it. It's ptsd from a year ago when a client I am a CNA I worked with closely felt a little sick and got out of the car and threw up and died as I did cpr and he bled all over me. Then 2 weeks later my grandma died. Then 2 weeks later two friends died of random heart attacks. Healthy 20 year Old college students with no history of drugs or alcohol. One was found on her bathroom floor and they found out she had an unknown genetic heart condition. The other was eating with his girlfriend and on the way home said he felt a little sick to pull over. He threw up and died of a heart attack there.Basically I'm terrified I have a brain tumor and my physical symptoms of my panic attacks are severe. I can't speak. My throat closes and I gag. I get cold sweats and I can't even get up to pee or drink water. Every single tiny little ache or pain in my body I fixate on for the whole day and Google 50 symptoms a day. I take my spo2 10 times a day. Blood pressure 8 times a day and heart rate 1530 times a day. I've never been diagnosed with any condition ever. I've never had high BP. My hr is 62.I'm 22 and terrified daily I will die any second and I'm working SOOOO hard to not live like this. But it feels like a million things to work on at once and my health anxiety doesn't get addressed as much. ,Anxiety
35204,I was doing so well... But now Im writing this from the ER. I woke up this evening around 3am with some sharp stabbing pains in the back of my left knee.

35206,Worried about glaucoma I have been worried about this on and off for about 8 months now. I have always had bad vision and it keeps getting worse. Ive had eye exams every year and nothing about glaucoma was ever mentioned except for once when I was maybe 14 and they said they wanted to keep an eye on it but by the next appointment my eye was normal. The vision I my right eye has been getting worse and has just recently turned a bit red. I am 19 years old and studying to be a nurse but I cannot do that if Im blind. Any thoughts about this? ,Anxiety
35207,Have sore lymphnodes form infection in arm. Worried about sepsis I had a small pimple on the inside of my right arm come up last Thursday. The area started hurting and the lymphnodes on my armpit became tender. I went to a walk in clinic Monday and they drained the pimple and sent me out. I went back in today and they looked over the area and gave me antibiotics due to the lymphnodes still being tender and the pain radiating into my chest.I picked up the prescription and got home and realized I have the wrong prescription. So now my worry is that it will get a lot worse through the night and Ill develop sepsis.,Anxiety
35208,Insomnia driving me crazy I always had sleep issues but it has been getting worse since December. I was on trazodone 100mg for a year all of the sudden it stopped working. Tried increasing my dose didn't help. I was put on ambien made me do weird stuff. Next I tried Lunesta but it didn't work. Melatonin doesn't work zzzquilbenadryl doesn't work. It takes me forever to fall asleep and I wake up 2 hours later around the same time. Takes me a bit to fall back to sleep just to wake up again. Last night I woke up around the same time but couldn't fall back to sleep. I'm worried something serious is causing my worsening insomnia I read cancer causes insomnia and so can other diseases.Now I'm scared I have some type of cancer or other serious disease. Makes me think this is why nothing seems to help me and why my trazodone stopped working. This is only going to make my insomnia worse..,Anxiety
35210,Going out on a limb here anyone else have benign brain calcification? I used to work at a cancer hospital and had severe health anxiety about brain tumors. I went to several doctors all of which said I was healthy. I finally worked up the courage to go to a neurologist and upon seeing how anxious I was she gave me a brain MRI. It turns out that I had an incidental finding which was benign brain calcification. She said it is unremarkable and the rest was deemed normal. I had another CT a year later and the size was unchanged. So that could indicate Ive just had it my whole life and means nothing and they pushed the next CT to 5 years away which would be next year or the year after. They did say that if Im having symptoms such as a headache they gave no other symptoms that we can schedule it sooner. Im just terrified that its multiplying in my brain right now or something. I have terrible health anxiety and get horrible symptoms especially with vision. Im just nervous that its the calcification causing this and not my anxiety. Has anyone else had experience with this? Or any doctors that can give me some reassurance? I know I should just make an appointment with the neurologist but she already thinks Im crazy and told me to see a psychologist about my anxiety which I do lol. Thanks on advance! ,Anxiety
35211,Stomach worries I've always suspected I had IBS but my symptoms wouldn't flare up enough for me to really consider it. Last week I was getting pregnancy scares because my stomach felt like it was moving. I quickly took a test and it was negative. Then a couple days after I got a sore throat and stomach ache and sinus congestion. This has set me off big time worst I have had it since 2015. My stomach aches after eating anything and I'm not popping that much. My tummy feels like I've done a hundred sit ups and I don't know whether it's my anxiety manifesting into physical feelings or my stomach is telling me something serious is up. This is really starting to get to me and I'm so petrified of the the doctors the thought that I should just go and get some reassurance is scaring me too. I comfort ate last night and that set my stomach off obviously. Erghh,Anxiety
35212,Worried I could have contracted HIV at work I am a nurse who works in a doctor's office where we perform minor outpatient procedures for skin conditions. I was injecting a patient with local anesthetic lidocaine on the back. While injecting the lidocaine all of the sudden a stream of liquid started squirting out of the cyst I was injecting but only while I was injecting the anesthetic. It was clear liquid. It happened to squirt right on my mouth and lips. I was not wearing a mask at this point. I immediately wiped the area and then went and told the physician who I work with as I didn't know if it was just anesthetic that has come out or was whatever the cyst was consisting of. He stated that he would be able to tell as soon as he got in there to remove it. He injected more anesthetic and he same stream of liquid came out of the same location. He assumed it was likely lidocaine the medicine coming out of a pore. I was surprisingly fine right after it happened but now I am so concerned about any exposure to blood borne pathogens hep c and hiv as I am vaccinated against hep b. I am not sure if I was exposed to blood as it was only whatever liquid it was that splashed onto my mouth. I am concerned because my lips were dry and slightly cracked and I had a small very small cut as well. Being a medical professional myself I understand how those diseases are spread and I don't want to be unreasonable in my worry. There is just a part of me that wonders if there was blood mixed in with the fluid as I was injecting anesthetic with a needle and there was some small amount of blood on his skin from previous pokes with the needle and that the crackscut on my lips could have been exposed to any virus. The physician stated he would be glad to have the patient and myself tested if I am concerned but he does not seem too concerned himself. I know there is also no difference in testing the patient at this point or waiting to get tested myself in a few weeks as the outcome would be the same. I am simply wanting to hear if anyone has any thoughts and wanted to vent. As far as I know the patient was healthy and not HIV or hep c though there is no way to be sure without a test. This is my first real exposure to any body fluids in my career so I am very curious what others think or to get any advice on how to calm my mind. I am already planning to get myself tested in a few weeks once the typical window period of infection has passed. I know having the patient tested would be the easiest way for me to get quick results and relief from anxiety but I do not want to offend the patient either. I am getting sick with worry! Thank you in advance to anyone who responds. I appreciate you listening. ,Anxiety
35213,3 weeks of crazy medical symptoms and scared out of my mind Not sure where to even start. Around Christmas time I was drinking pretty heavily and abusing phenibut pretty bad. Once I returned back to work I slowly tapered everything down but still had lingering vertigo and dizziness. I went to the occupational nurse and explained this to her so she sent me to the ER after seeing my blood pressure through the roof. EKG chest xray and blood work all came back okay. Blood pressure a little on the high side but no big deal. A few days goes by and I'm noticing my eye is driving me nuts like it's super dry and irritated. I keep checking it and it looks fine. Check it again and I notice my eyebrow is hanging lower than normal so I panic because I'm thinking stroke and go to the ER. Get halfway there and get this rush of a weird taste in my mouth and I suddenly feel super weak and out of it. My head feels like it's expanding and I can't string a sentence together and my neck and shoulder muscles feel like they're all as tense as they possibly can be. Ambulance takes me to the ER get EKG chest xray and blood work and they give me a xanax and send me home saying it was a panic attack. Next time I'm in the ER it's the same thing. I start noticing my neck muscles are super tense and my heart is pounding and I try to keep calm for as long as possible but it doesn't go away so I go to the ER again. CT scan blood work and a small dose of ativan and I'm fine. Third time I convince myself sudden proptosis. PANIC. Go to the ER again same symptoms. My head feels like it's rushing with fluid neck muscles are insanely tense and I'm freaking out. Checks my eye pressure and gives a quick exam and I'm fine. Go see my regular doc and I keep explaining to him it's not anxiety. Never had attacks like these in my life. Did the usual neurological tests when I explained fear of a stroke and it was all fine. He asked me to smile. Asked me to really smile. Explained to him my left arm had been feeling a little weaker than normal and my armpit felt almost numb or inflamed. So he ordered an MRI because he said it felt colder than the other. Came home and checked my smile in the mirror and noticed the right side of my face is pretty much paralyzed. I can barely smile but I can close my eye. My eyebrow hangs lower than the left and my cheek sags a little. I called the ER doc and she said it's probably Bell's Palsy. Probably a 3 week timeframe. So I'm terrified I have a tumor or MS or something. I did have a CT scan that came back clean. The only symptom I still have is the drooping on my face. I keep thinking my left arm feels weak but I'm not even really sure. It's like the more I focus on it the worst it gets but otherwise I don't really notice it. Maybe it feels mildly colder. Right now my balance is fine. I find my self falling asleep for a few seconds at a time randomly when I'm at my desk but I sleep like shit because of anxiety. When I'm sitting down I get these weird feelings like someone's walking up the stairs like you can feel it in your butt from the vibrations but nothing's actually happening. My vision has been blurry for the past two years but my eye doctor said it's nothing to be concerned about. I don't even know. My doctor is out until the beginning of March and all I want are my MRI results so I know what's going on. Are these panic attacks is this just bell's palsy brought on my all of the stress of the past three weeks?I'm fucking terrified. Sorry for the rant. ,Anxiety
35214,Should I see a neurologist? Worried about Brain Tumor? Hey everyoneI've been a bit worried about having a brain tumor in the past few days. Had some small headaches two weeks ago usually when I had shitty sleep. Had some more bad headaches this past weekend though I had shitty sleep. They came in the morning and then in the evening. Took some Ibuprofen and it went away but kinda came in a dull ache when I was starting at the computer screen about two hours later.Ever since Monday I have not had the headaches except sometimes in the morning when it is a dull kind of feeling not really a pain. I dont wake up with them but then I start thinking about the headache and felt stressed and then it came on. Goes away after two hours and it hasnt come up again the past few days. I had one today and I took a tynelol and the pain went away after an hour. Also haven't had nausea unless I had pizza pops or greasy food. No Seizures though yesterday as I was sleeping my right leg moved a bit but that was it. I dont know if thats a seizure.Not any cognitive problems. My speech and personality are fine but I have been on edge as I have been thinking and reading about Brain Tumors. Recently with my memory I am able to recall stuff fine but when I remind myself to do something after I kept repeating to myself what I have to do because I read about someone who was worried he had a brain tumor and he kept forgetting stuff after 20 seconds. After this I am worried I might be forgetting things. I did a memory recall test where I got over 84 in recalling images. Im not forgetting questions or anything of the sort but I have been on edge recently. I am 21. I do have a cold and had some pressure in my ears and nose that have gone away but I am going to see the doctor. Do you think I should see a neurologist? What I am worried about is the headaches in the morning? They were bad this weekend but got better and have not been painful.Generally I found the headaches occured when I had bad sleep. I've been sleeping quite late like at 230250 and waking up at 9 or 10. I do move a lot when I sleep so I probably sleep past that. ampx200B,Anxiety
35215,I choked on a grape and now I'm worried that it got into my lungs does this sound possible? As stupid as this sounds my anxiety is telling me that since I was eating a grape and laughed and coughed a bit I inhaled the juice and my lungs are going to react. Should I worry? The long version is I laughed while eating a grape and it caused me to cough it was more coughing than I'm used to and it burned a bit so I was worried that I didn't cough it out well enough. I'm feeling a little tired now 6hrs later and short of breath and my mucus is that sickly yellow. I felt immediate pain an hour after it happened but I don't feel it anymore but most of these might be health anxiety. I haven't coughed since it happened which should tell me that nothing is wrong but I'm worried nonetheless. I spend most of my time worrying about this sort of thing and I realise it's bordering impossible to have it happen but I can't stop worrying. ,Anxiety
35216,Sternum Popping and Pain I'm a 31M. For the past 23 weeks my sternum has been audibly popping. Like my wife heard it the other night when we were eating dinner. At first there was no discomfort but over the past few days pressure builds in the center of my chest causing discomfort. Then my sternum pops and the pain goes away only to return minutes later.I went to the Dr yesterday and got an xray and and ECG which she said looked slightly abnormal compared to an ECG I had in 2014. She is sending me to a cardiologist. I don't know my xray results yet. My appointment with the cardiologist is Feb 25th. Seems so far away and I keep thinking what if I have a heart attack between now and then? I know it's not going to happen but the fear keeps trying to creep in. The pain isn't terrible or dibilitating but its enough to cause me anxiety. Im trying not to let it get the best of me but it's hard. Thanks for reading!,Anxiety
35217,Hypochondria getting pretty bad So lately Ill be watching something and then feel like I dont understand it fully or Ill read something and it just wont make sense to me.

Ive always been convinced I have some neurological issue and now Im starting to think someone poisoned me to dumb me down on purpose. ,Anxiety
35218,Worried about rabies 41F 59 192 lbs Caucasian Lower leg There was a skinny feral cat in my yard this evening. I have not seen him before. It was clear he was neutered a while ago. I happened to have just bought canned cat food and was bringing it inside when I saw him lickingbiting a paper plate I had left out earlier that day to feed another feral cat. I opened a can of cat food and dumped it out. The offending cat was ravenous and ate a whole can in less than one minute. I fed him another can and he scarfed about half of it. Then he was happy and let me pet him. Afterward he started cleaning himself. I began walking through my yard and he started to follow me. Then out of no where he scratched and bit my leg through my work pants. It wasnt super hard but when I came inside I see it slightly broke my skin. I washed it with soap and water but now Im worried about rabies exposure. Ive attached a picture of the scratchbite. Any input would be greatly appreciated as I dont know Im being anxious over nothing or if there is a real health threat here. ,Anxiety
35219,I got innocently bit by a feral kitten trapped in my house now I'm dying of course. Two feral kittens were eating food my family put out for them and our cat scared them so they ran inside the house. In the process of trying to literally herd cats one of them bit my knuckle while I tried fishing him out of the corner. I washed it with alcohol and soap for 10 minutes.After doing some Googling !!! I went to the ER two days later. I must have rabies!After explaining the situation the nurses and doctor were very reassuring that I probably didn't need a rabies vaccine. They said it was ultimately up to me but she said in my professional opinion I wouldn't get it. As it was expensive and insurance might not cover it.So I got a tetanus shot and antibiotics instead.Tetanus shot made me feel like trash and now I've had a the subtlest mildest of headaches for three days. It's so light I'm not even certain I have one half the time. I'm hyper aware of every muscle twitch I have. When my hands get cold I panic thinking they're going numb. I check to make sure I can still swallow.Any day now the headache will get intense and I'll wake up to my hand being completely numb. Then I'll go back to the ER and they'll tell me there's nothing they can do because I'm dead meat. It happened on the 9th and all of the feral cats appear fine still. Mom and dad cat and three kittens. None rabid or dying.But I'm still dying. And constantly on alert about my body. Does my head hurt or am I making it hurt by thinking about it so damn much?To make it worse I got taken off my Ativan ages ago because I switched doctors and the new one refuses to prescribe anything remotely addictive.Fml,Anxiety
35220,Freaking out after blood test I had a blood test today just a normal panel for checkup and it seems the nurse blew my vein.

35222,Left arm amp leg pain Hi all last night my left arm amp leg started aching and felt tingly. I fell asleep okay but it started back up this morning. Im trying not to be anxious about it but I definitely am. Ive had a tight neck the last few days so Im wondering if that has anything to do with this. Or maybe a vitamin deficiency? IDK but its stressing me out and if it keeps up Ill probably head to doctor next week. Just hoping Im able to keep a straight head and avoid the ER this weekend. Ughhhhh. Anyone dealt with something similar?,Anxiety
35223,One time I thought I had lupus But instead I was diagnosed with tender breasts due to being a woman.At the urgent clinic no less accompanied by my aunt who drove me there at late af o'clock.At the time I had a sobbing meltdown in the parking lot. Not only did I still not know how I was dying but I felt humiliated by having a sweet old nurse tell me at 22 years old that the achy lumps were tits not lymph nodes.Now though it's kind of hilarious. And laughing at the ridiculous shit my brain comes up with is so cathartic. ,Anxiety
35224,actual problems mixed with anxiety I have one legitimate issue that i will get an appointment for on monday sadly the weekend is inbetween. My BPM which usually is around 5565 got higher and flip flops around a lot it is between 80 and 100 now when i am sitting or lying down and my bloodpressure similarly got a tad higher not to worrying heights it is below 140 and what is worrying me flip flops around a lot when i take several measurements like going from 100 to 130 and back several times when i do not move and measure 10 times over the course of some minutes even when i am sitting still and relaxed.This is an issue i legitimately think might have to do with my thyroids no cancer fears about the thyroids i think it might just be hyperactive and that makes sense because i am celiac and celiacs often have other autoimmune diseases most commonly thyroid stuff.Now to what actually makes me scared and is probably nothingToday after a long time of it not happening happened a lot before my celiac diagnosis my whole body vibrated with my pulse i could feel it everywhere most importantly neck my pulse was actually off too high above 100 even when sitting sometimes going as far as near 120 and i felt pressure in my gutts and chest. The pressure was so bad that depending on how i moved it felt like organs press on organs and i felt sick.My neck was not only vibrating with my pulse it also got very tensed not some kind of stiffness that made it unable to move but i felt like someone grabbed me just at the start of the back of my head and pressed his finger into it shutting down the blood flow except for the very strong pulsations.I had these symptoms before more or less as i said and I assume that it is Roemheld syndrome a benign but very scary kind of thing because i know that my heart is fine. It got very thoroughly checked back then and it was fine in the months before i could do sports i am not feeling weak i am not having syncopes.Roemheld syndrome means that you got so much pressure in your gutts due to air and food that it presses against your heart chest and lungs so you experience very scary sensations similar to angina pectoris but it is not actually dangerous. Your heart rate is increased your chest feels tight you might have shortness of breath but you are going to be fine once the pressure is gone. But that can take a long time and in that time you think you will die and you need to go to the ER.I had that today the first time in almost a year and i was kinda broken that it came back. I thought i beat it and then suddenly here i am thinking i got a lung emboli or my veins are shut down or there is a tumor pressing on my heart or veins. Or i got a brain aneurysm because i also felt pulsations in my head and heard noises in my air i dont think these are noises it usually makes when you got very high bp since my bp is not actually that high and it was only one air AND i got a head MRT the year before and it was fine. Now i am very sure that roemheld is what caused this because yesterday i drank a lot of booze and cola while eating and i had a bit of pressure before that to begin with but the reason that i am still like 'ya gonna die' is that i lost so much weight compared to last time. I lost more than 10 kilo so there should be far more space for my innards. I am not overweight anymore.So what my anxiety brain thinks is this Back then a tumor right behind my sternum pressing on my heart. Ofc the pressure got better when i lost weight and stuff but now it grew enough to make up for it and it presses again against my heart and no doctor will check for that obviously the tumor is not visible via sono but NEEDS MRT or CT and at some point it will just destroy my heart and I will die. Or my neck or bones presses on important veins and i will also die because the vein will burst even tho i had an mrt of the neck for legit reasons just 2 months ago and while my neck had issues noone said anything about veins.ampx200BI am fine now because i drank a lot of herbal tea that helps with roemheld but i am still here thinking about tumors and also thyroid cancer.As a bonus point i think about it even being my own fault because i might have ingested gluten accidently i probably didnt but i live for some time with a non celiac so there is some chance there was contamination of my food but he is careful and i am too so it aint probable and the gluten made the belly angry.I really hope this was a one time thing and i am not falling back into anxiety due to roemheld i will be extra careful about food in the next days. I will not eat today until the belly died down and sadly my eating choice are limited due to celiac in any case not a lot of good 'get healthy' food at least not in my flat and drink very much of the herbal tea.ampx200BWhen i feel better i will do some sit ups and push ops to try to straighten out my belly and i will massage my neck as much as i can.So far i am at least not predialing the medics anymore. ,Anxiety
35225,Scared I have lymphoma I have extreme anxiety and this has been almost crippling. I have 5 abnormal lymph nodes in my neck that are all over 1 cm in size. Im getting a biopsy today for them and Ive never been more scared in my life. I dont have really any other symptoms other than its sore in the area headaches stuffy nose and sometimes its harder to swallow since my neck is so sore. Ive had the swollen lymph nodes for a month now with them gradually getting bigger. They can move around to the touch. I had blood work done 3 weeks ago and it came back normal.

35226,Brain tumor anxiety Hey everyone I'm new to this subreddit. I feel like recently I've been suffering from health anxiety. It suddenly came up out of nowhere. First I was convinced something was wrong with my heart I started having lots of different symptoms and was truly convinced something was wrong. Got it all checked and it turned out fine. Afterwards I still felt kinda sick so I got a blood test done which came back clear. This was about 3 weeks ago. A bit later I started having these headaches and my vision suddenly got worse at least I got the impression. Now I don't know if this is purely because I started focusing on it or that it actually is something bad. Anyway I decided to go back to the doctor since I work in IT and dealing with the vision thing and headaches was getting pretty hard.ampx200BHe checked me asked lots of different things but he didn't seem quite sure about what it was. He sent me to an eye doctor got my eyes checked there and it turned out I need resting glasses for screen work ETC. My eyes have been bad my entire life had glasses since I was 3. I've also been having this visual snow again I think I've had this for a long time but it's like my mind suddenly seems to notice and freak out about it same with things like my tinnitus which I've also had for years.ampx200BI'm still just scared I may have a brain tumor because of the bad vision and headaches. But if I had a brain tumor they would have seen it in the blood test from a few weeks back right? Or no? The doctor or eye doctor would have rang the alarm bell if something was seriously wrong right? ampx200BDo you guys think I'm fine?

Then I was dealing with an upper respiratory infection and my symptoms lingered for so long that I thought I had strepwhich thankfully I didn't. But I've been experiencing so many more stomach pains these past few weeks and last night I was awake for what felt like the worst acid reflux I've ever had!!! I'm still feeling it today I don't know if it's GERD an ulcer or could even be side effects from the birth control I'm using... but of course I think it's a million different horrible issues...,Anxiety

35230,Upper Neck Spine Pain Anxiety So I've been diagnosed with GAD and I'm a senior in college so I've had unbelievably high stress and anxiety levels lately because of my impending graduation and uncertain future. Within the past few weeks I've developed this disturbing new symptom where whenever I start to feel anxious or stressed I get this weird pressure feeling in my neck almost as if it is in my spine and someone is squeezing it. From there my panic takes over and my heart begins to race my stomach hurts and I feel nauseous I get a tension headache and I feel all wound up and ready to flee. My upper neck and shoulder muscles have been incredibly tight lately so rationally I'm sure this spinal feeling is just a result of muscle tension and anxiety as well as the crappy dorm mattress and my poor posture. However I've convinced myself I have a brain tumor or am going to develop epilepsy or something. Dr. Google certainly didn't help because I Googled symptoms of a brain tumor and guess what I have most of them! I just don't know what to do to calm myself down I feel like I'm spiraling out of control. ,Anxiety
35231,Fears of ALS or other Motor Neuron Disease. Please help! M. 27 years. Type Two Diabetic diet and medication controlled. History of chronic back pain around T6T7 vertebrae unilateral up until a few months ago now bilateral.For a few weeks I've had a light flickering that alternates in each eye. This is accompanied with occasional twitching particularly in my right tricep forearm and occasionally my hand. These occur any where between once and three to four times a day and while strong are often brief.I am pretty sure that the symptoms started after a pulled muscle in the right side of my neck. I had some stiffness for a few hours one morning before I turned my head suddenly causing a shooting pain up that side of my neck and within a short time a massive headache lasting about a day followed by an inability to move my head properly for a few days.Smaller twitches occur up and down my legs though I feel that may have to do with acute sensitivity due to how much anxiety this is causing me. And I have had a lot of lower back hip and left leg pain that has come and gone for the last five or so years.Other symptoms that occur include pain and weakness in my pinky shoulder and inner forearm that come and go. These symptoms are exacerbated when I am seated at work and are particularly intense when I am at work using a mouse keyboard or when my arm is crooked at an awkward angle for too long such as using my phone.Logic tells me that all of this is caused by a combination environmental factors and anxiety given that about 8 months ago I made the transition from a standing job various retail positions for about 8 years to a desk job and I've NEVER had great posture. My physio is confident that all of this is caused by compression of the Cervical spine where he says there is obvious stiffness between the joints in some parts particularly at the base of the skull. He also says the spindle especially likes to compensate so pain in one area untreated can eventually lead to difficulties along the whole spine and that after ten years of untreated pain he isnt surprised by my symptoms. He and my GP suggest seeing a neurologist but only if my symptoms persist. Sorry for the long post. This has really allowed me to catalogue and rationalise my thoughts. In all honesty I am feeling as though this may be anxiety. An abnormal ultrasound showed possible cancer of the testicle this time last year and I've been spiraling ever since... I also knew it was a bad idea to read Stephen Hawkings posthumous novel at a time I wa already so anxious but alas I did and have suddenly started experiencing the twitching.

35234,Racing heart rate after trip to ER for allergic reaction scare I went to the ER last night around 11pm for trouble breathing after eating something new. I do have food allergies but this item did not say it contained any of them. They treated me with an antinausea medicine a bendryl and a steroid and sent me home. I ate some dinner and went to bed. I woke up about an hour ago to get ready to go somewhere and my heart was racing in the 140s just from standing up. Sitting is 120s. I took some deep breaths and got it in the high 90s but if I stand up it shoots up again. It feels racing in my chest as well. Is this anxiety? Is this something from the steroids they gave me? I am freaking out right now. Should I go back to the ER?Female26Taking Zyrtec x2OcellaMetoprololSingular ,Anxiety

35236,Stomach pains So last month I was really stressed because of college. I ate avocados the same day and got a stomach ache later. Today I got stressed again and ate avocados and got a stomach ache later in the day again. It was just very sharp abdominal pain that lasted for an hour and then subdued when I laid on my right side. The thing is I dont know if its stress avocados or something more serious causing this. Its absolutely not bowel related because I didnt need to use the bathroom. If its avocados that would be strange because I ate them for the past week but I was fine other than these two occasions. Im scared to see a doctor because I dont want to freak out my mom. Is there anyone with insight on what this might be? Im still very young but last month my grandma had abdominal pain and found out it was colon cancer so Im panicking and Im dreading to see the doctor.,Anxiety

35240,Self diagnosis past 4 months I thought I would just list all the diseasesproblems I've convinced myself I've had the past few months. Multiple trips to the Dr multiple blood tests everything coming back clear. Diabetes HIV throattonguemouth cancer MS lupus overactive thyroid and sjogrens syndrome. Yup it's been a tough few months I've lost so much sleep thinking about how I'm going to tell my friends and family will I have to move back home to die? But I'm so young this is so unfair? I'm still struggling but for the past week I've stopped googling and honestly it has helped. I still get the thoughts and worries but by not googling they do not manifest in my mind as much. My doctor has diagnosed me with something though and that something is anxiety. I think it's important to remember that anxiety does have LOADS of physical symptoms over 100! and can affect people in different ways. A website I find useful I know no googling but this is different right is httpswww.anxietycentre.comanxietysymptoms.shtml I've been lurking on this sub for the past month or so and can really relate to posts here on a daily basis. It's somewhat comforting to know you're not alone with these crazy thoughts. If anyone is struggling and wants someone to talk to my DMs are open have a great week everybody.

35241,Can't stop coughing! Hey everyone I'm new to this subreddit but was wondering if anyone else has gone through this and had any advice. For about a year now maybe longer? I've had a dry cough. Like I cough like crazy every day. When I go to the doctor they say everything sounds fine no liquid or anything. I even had them test me for asthma and my breathing tests came back normal. At this point I'm pretty sure my coughing is just a nervous tick that stems from my health anxiety... which is pretty severe. I do get acid reflux and I have bad seasonal allergies but neither of those things caused my cough before a year or so ago. I guess I'm kind of obsessed with making sure my lungs are clear especially if water or something accidentally goes down the wrong pipe. When that happens I cough nonstop to the point where it hurts. Aside from being annoying and embarrassing I find that I've been getting a lot more chest pain from time to time and my throat hurts. So does anyone else do this? Do you have an advice on stopping? I just really want to stop. Thanks!,Anxiety
35242,If I had headaches that came on but have now dissapeared should I not be worried? Hi everyoneI had headaches last weekend that lasted for a few days. They were pretty bad around the forehead area and came on in the mornings and evenings on Friday Saturday and Sunday. They pretty much went away from like Monday to Thursday except for a dull feeling but now that is gone as well. So should I be worried of something such as a brain tumor? I was diagnosed with an ear infection but I am taking antibiotics. I haven't really had any other issues. I have been stressed about my short term memory but I am able to recall stuff well but I sometimes forgot about tasks I need to do. I do have ADHD so I believe this is the cause but I tend to remember the tasks. I also have some moments where I am zoning out because I am thinking so much but this only happens when I am in front of a computer and I am usually able to recognize that I am not paying attention and snap out of it so I dont believe I am having seizures.,Anxiety

35245,I am going to share with you something that has always cheered me up and calmed me down whenever I get really anxious over my health So this sub only seems to really have posts from users describing their symptoms and trying to get diagnosed on Reddit now if that helps you with your anxiety that's cool however it can be counter intuitive as the whole googling and obsessing over symptoms is the actual problem we all came here to rid ourselves in the first place. So I honestly do believe we should move more away from I have xyz symptoms am I going to die? to How can I find peace of mind and stop googling One thing I do to get peace of mind is watch this episode of Hey Arnoldhttpswww.wco.tvheyarnoldseason2episode5monkeybusiness2 which is my all time favourite show it's only the first episode in the video provided called 'monkey business' btw I won't ruin it for you all but it's really funny and will hit home for all of us it highlights how silly we can be sometimes when we think we have a really bad illness and start obsessing over symptoms.

35247,Please help Orthorexia health anxiety veganism and internet quacks Hi there ampx200BI experience health anxiety and orthorexia I have a really unhealthy relationship with food and my health anxiety revolves extremely around food. However I have spent so much money on tests and seeing doctos and am at my wits end. Every health test I have had through a legitimate NHS doctor gastroenterologist and specialist I have been told I have nothing to stress about. I had a blood test for pernicious anemia a full blood count test for everything a stool test through the gastroenterologist. My worry now is that I have SIBO or some weird gut disease. I am also vegan. However I am worried that I am being misled by internet quacks who want to sell fake or bullshit health tests out of desperation a few weeks ago i bought and took an organic acids test and it cost 256 and the online nutrition coach who sells the test recommends I take a SIBO test so i can know if I have it but im concerned ill just be given a false positive which will further amp up my health anxiety and orthorexia. I even spent 300 on a mercury tritest because I was worried I had mercury poisoning from fillings Which I now recognise as untrue and a very common case of health quackery. I spent 200 on 'viome' where you send a stool sample and its completely bogus. I dont know what to do i'm obsessed with the idea that my anxiety is linked to my gut health even though I dont have any of the genuine symptoms of SIBO. I'm just sick of being obsesseed with my health and the food I eat. it had got to the point where I lost a stone and weighed 4951kg as a 21 year old male at 56. ampx200BIf anyone can relate to this please feel free to reach out or give some advice.ampx200BThank you ,Anxiety

35249,Swollen lymph node in neck and groin for months Hello!So Ive always had lymph nodes that I can feel easily. The two underneath my jaw swelled up when I was about 12 and remain enlarged now Im 21. About a year ago I had felt a squishy node in my neck its smaller than a grape and also one of the same size in my groin region. They are moveable. O do not recall any reasons for them swelling up.I went to the DR in September who didnt seem concerned about them but told me to go back if they didnt disappear in a few weeks. Of course theyre still hereand I chose not to go back to the DR as I had no other symptoms and thought the stress of having scans etc would do more harm than good.Ive felt absolutely fine since the the nodes havent increased in size. But I read a story about how lymph nodes should always go down and now Im scared I have lymphoma.This is giving me massive anxiety and symptoms I plan to ask the Dr tomorrow but I think I just want some reassurance until then as Im driving myself crazy! ,Anxiety

Not necessarily palpitations just like I'm constantly aware of the blood closing through my body. Occasionally I feel a flutter in my throat. I asked my doctor about it and he asked if I wanted a 48hour holter monitor just to be sure. Of course I said yes.The nurse who put the monitor on me said a lot of very terrifying things about how rare it is for her to see a monitor come back with normal results. She was a real Debbie Downer and it did not help my anxiety about this whole thing. So I figured I would ask y'all have you ever had a holter monitor that came back with good results?,Anxiety

35255,Has anyone been cured of health anxiety? Im getting to the point of where Im just fed up with this. I know my anxiety is irrational yet I still cant help but worry myself into a panic attack everytime I have the mildest of symptoms. Most of my health anxiety revolves around chest pains I get. Ive seen countless doctors and specialists and theyre convinced its either musculoskeletal or anxiety related. Yet everytime I feel that mild ache in my chest that most people would probably ignore I feel convinced that this time its it. This time its really a heart attack or some other life threatening event. Ive even bought myself a portable ekg monitor which I use almost every time I have my chest pain symptoms to calm myself down. Has anyone been cured of this? This health anxiety is relatively new for me. It started in October 2018 when I first started experiencing these mild chest pains yet I have no significant risk factors for heart disease nor do any of the countless medical tests Ive had done to me indicate I have heart disease yet its not enought to put my mind at ease. This is really starting to affect my life as Im scared of going out and doing fun stuff thinking Ill get a heart attack or something else and wont get help in time. Will seeing a therapist or some other health professional help?,Anxiety
35256,Anyone else get really bad feelings of impending doom without being scared of a specific illness? My health anxiety is weird in that I don't really fear any 'specific' illness. Instead I worry about dying of an unknownundiagnosed condition. I worry specifically that my consciousness is about to end that I'm beginning the process of passing out and I'm never going to wake up.I primarily get intense feelings of impending doom which leave me paralysed with fear often unable to do anything but lie down in bed and close my eyes. In the past I used to go to the hospital a lot and beg the doctors not to let me die but now I at least have the courage to just freak out at home.The impending feelings of doom are so intense they leave me shaking and feeling cold. Sometimes while huddled in bed in the midst of a panic attack I even involuntarily shake and yell out things to myself like Please I don't want to die. Like the fear of death is so strong I actually blurt things out reflexively without being able to control it.This is happening to me basically every day now and leading me to spend increasing amounts of time just lying down at home. When I try and socialise I'm often distracted from the conversation by thoughts I'm about to die. I spend about 80 of my life fixated on these horrible thoughts aboht dying and about 1020 of my life experiencing this intense feeling of doom.I need help. I don't want to live like this any more.Has anyone felt this way or been in a similar situation? Is there anything I should try to help myself?,Anxiety

I looked it up and apparently doctors dont really know why they happen or how to stop them. I didnt think much of it at the time but whenever Im in a high stress situation having an anxiety attack or when Im trying to fall asleep the thought comes into my head and it scares me so much. I feel like Im trapped in my brain and its like a bomb can go off any second and I would just die.

Last year I got a tumor benign removed and ever since that whole situation my health anxiety has done the opposite of going away. I got stomach pains maybe one or two weeks before my surgery and it's around my lower abdomen. It got to the point where I went to the ER and they couldn't figure it out even after doing some urine exams. After a bit it went away.

Cancer is the only thing on my mind especially now that I feel like I'm prone to tumors. I'm very scared. I feel like I'll die tomorrow and nobody would notice or care since they never ask if I'm doing okay even though I'm very obviously going through something and this includes the people closest to me.

Well I should start this by saying I have a history of headaches near the front and sides of my headI'm not sure what exactly caused it and I'm considering seeing a doctor about it but that's not the point of this post and yesterday I had one of these horrible headaches. I took 600mg of Ibuprofen for it and about 12 hours later 500 mg or Acetaminophen and AspirinAlso 130 mg of Caffeine but I doubt that'd have an effect.ampx200BUpon waking up today I had the same headache as yesterday and I took my medicine I take every morning which is too much to list but they don't interfere with either but I also took the 500 mg or Acetaminophen and Aspirin. About 10 minutes later the headache was still horribleIt was so bad that I forgot I took the medicine and I took 600mg of Ibuprofen.ampx200BWhile I generally try not to double upor triple up because Acetaminophen and Aspirin in one pill?? and generally limit myself to 400mg of Ibuprofen every 6 hours at least with some cases like yesterday and today where my headaches are generally bad I will go up to 600 mg and possibly even 800 mg if the original 600 mg of Ibuprofen didn't work after an hour. I really try to avoid this because I've had some stomach issues when I take too much that will go away after taking a normal dose for a while. Even when just taking 200 mg of Ibuprofen I try not to take Aspirin at the same time but I forgot about it because that's just how much pain I was in.ampx200BI most likely have a migraine and combined with sinuses and bad weather outside it can cause these headaches. Luckily the medicine has helped quite a bit but I know they can have side effects and shouldn't be taken together very oftenespecially in the doses I took themampx200BThe point of this post is I want to make sure I'm not in immediate danger of anything for taking 500mg of Acetaminophen and Aspirin with 600 mg of Ibuprofen at onceNot asking for the future I don't plan on taking that much I just want to make sure I'm safe ampx200BTLDR I forgot I took 500 mg of Acetaminophen and Aspirin in 2 pillssame pain killer because of my headache and just waking up and then took 600 mg of Ibuprofen about 10 minutes later and I just want to make sure I'm not at risk for doing this once.ampx200BDon't plan on doubling up like this in the future and it was a mistake of me being in so much pain combined with being tired from just waking up.,Anxiety

I decided to skip my off week between my last pack and current pack and Ive been having some serious pain in my right breast. Its mostly only if I touch it and its always in the same spot.

I will go to the doctor in two weeks if it hasn't gotten any better. I will freak out then but I'm not going to worry about it until it's time to book the appointment.

Keeping at it at january 16th i ran significantly faster because i increased my cadence from 165 to 180 so i took 4 minues off my 5k.The day after my shin started hurting a dull ache on the upper 23 just outside my shinbone. The pain was very diffuse and I still have trouble finding out if it is my bone or muscle hurting. However this pain came only when i stood for a long time and at night. Running on it didnt really change the pain however I was limping a little bit a friend pointed it out he didnt know about it.I stopped running on the 22nd january hoping it would get better However the pain persisted. At the 31st of january I called my doctor and asked for an appointment she game me one at february 26th which i think is a long time to wait with this ache however since it didnt really hurt THAT bad so i guess i could wait pain is 34 out of 10.On february 2nd i went skiing and the pain subsided a littlebit however it has been acompanied with a sharper more localized pain an inch below my tibial tuberosity and one to the left of itPIC httpsimgur.comjNpPV1rhttpsimgur.comjNpPV1r . I dont know if this is because I have fallen a couple of times I had many more bruises but they disapeared 45 days after coming home. I came home on the 10th of february and My pain still persists i have tried the RICE method and stretching nothing works.At the point im typing this I havent run for a long time and its been 10 days since ive been skiing. The pain has increased this week and today it is on an all time high. I can still walk and bike but it is starting to intefere even more and the ankle pain has come back too. I to have my legs up for as long time as possible the last days i have rested 10 hours minimum in the daytime practicing RICE.Should I call my doc to get an earlier appointment? I called her today to ask for advice based on this story she assumed it was shin splints and told me to stretch.What do you think it is? I may add that i am a hypochondriac and somewhere inside me keeps telling me it could be bone cancer and I really hate that so I try to stay optimistic and think about the rarity of it albeit I am on strong Immunosuppressants. The thought of it being cancer and just assuming it is something else makes me extremely anxious.TLDR Dull shin pain began after running pb 15th jan stopped running about a week after pain persisted and after 8 days of skiing 1st feb9th feb has gotten accompanied by a sharp pain in the bone. Pic of location httpsimgur.comjNpPV1rhttpsimgur.comjNpPV1r from friday it started getting worse. I have an appointment on the 26th feb should i call for an earlier? I am afraid this is more serious than a shin splint maybe a stress fracture maybe bone cancer...sorry for the long post i just think a more detailed description helps. I really hope you can help. Thanks for reading. ,Anxiety
35274,Concussion anxiety I am 16 and I've had a repetitive head injury that let to a concussion 2 years ago. Since then I have been paranoid of every bump to my head I know the only way to really tell are the symptoms. I still have symptoms and eyestrain. What should I do,Anxiety
35275,Cant handle this feeling I found a small black dot under my big toe nail. Like a sharpie dot. I googled and it could be a very rare but serious form of skin cancer. If it grows out its just a blood blister. If not it could be skin cancer. I dont recall stubbing my toe. Im 28 Caucasian but not super fair hairedeyedskin. Ugh I cant wait to see if it grows out. But I also feel ridiculous going to the doctor for a black dot. I wake up in the mornings with the sickening thought that I have skin cancer and it ruins my day. My stomach is gurgled and in knots and Im convinced the cancer has spread.The only reason I think Ive got this intense health anxiety now is because my mom got diagnosed a few months ago with breast and she felt fine the lump was found during a routine mammogram it was so tiny still even she didnt know it was there.,Anxiety

35277,Should I be worried about my swollen lymph node Ive had a slightly swollen lymph node on the right side of my neck under my chin for a week. Doesnt hurt and hasnt increased in size. I also dont feel sick which is actually what worries me because I was looking up my symptoms I know bad idea and all my symptoms pointed to lymphoma. I just got blood work done less than two weeks ago though for something else and everything looked normal. Should I go to a doctor anyway or does this just happen sometimes? Ive been touching it a lot so Im not sure if Im irritating it ,Anxiety
35278,Does anyone else fear they will constantly get food poisoning? Im a food lover and certainly dont hold back on eating new things. But over the past year my health anxiety has grown to have a newfound paranoia...whenever I cook Im scared I will undercook things like chicken fish beef etc. Its not taking over my life or anything but my boyfriend thinks Ive become a total hypochondriac! Does anyone else have this? I have health anxiety generally and am frequently scarred Ill get the flu etc. But food poisoning is a new one....perhaps its because Ive had some bad bouts of illness over the past few years after travelling. How do you get over this unnecessary anxiety?,Anxiety

35281,Stiff neck and head aches worried this could be be bacterial meningitis after ear infection? About 6 days ago I started getting strange head aches. I felt a sudden short sharp pain on the left side of my head which was followed by extreme warmth and a panic attack. Since then I've had sharp head pain come randomly for a couple seconds then go. It's usually on the left middle side of my head but sometimes happens on the right. I've also been having bouts of pain in the back of the head as well. I haven't needed to take medicine for this as the pain comes randomly and isn't painful enough to need relief.ampx200B From the first day this happened I also had stiff shoulders and neck. I assumed this was because of anxiety that the headaches were from stress muscle strain. Today the neck pain got so bad I needed advil. It feels very stiff and over the course of the last hour it's gotten significantly worse. The advil hasn't kicked in yet even though i took it 30 mins ago. I'm really worried this could be bacterial meningitis? I got an ear infection a couple days before the initial headaches. I was prescribed antibiotics for it but did not take them because the infection got better after a couple more days. Any advice is greatly appreciated.,Anxiety

35283,Worried about colon cancer Around Christmas time I started having upper abdominal pain it lasted a few weeks and eventually turned into loose stools every morning. The abdominal pain got better but the loose stools kept up until about the first week of February. I think it lasted about 5 weeks total. I havent had any since then except for one last Saturday morning and a bit of constipation last week. This all started after a couple of really bad weeks of eating and sleeping. A lot of overtime work and I ate a lot of garbage food like pizza and chocolate. I now feel kinda gassy sometimes but I think the rest is closer to normal now.... Also.. about 4 weeks ago I went to the washroom and saw a couple of bright spots of red on the toilet paper that went away after a few wipes. I have gone to my family doctor and I did an ultrasound and all was fine. Despite that Im convinced I might have colon cancer after reading online and despite my family history of colon issues my doctor doesnt want to do a colonoscopy. I dunno what to do.... ,Anxiety

35290,HA Hopelessness I have had health related anxiety issues for the past 5 months and just when they seem to be getting better and I have a solid week it all comes crashing down again.At the beginning I was convinced that I was going to have a heart attack then it was a pulmonary embolism and now I think I have some kind of emphysema or lung cancer I used to smoke and it haunts me. I can't make it stop and it seems like once I handle one issue and a doctor clears me my brain just latches onto another new thing and starts a new cycle of tracking symptoms googling and doctors appointments. Like jesus fucking christ enough already! It makes me feel so hopeless and sad I don't want to go through this every day. It's like my own personal hell loop because I feel like I can't trust my own brain to make rational decisions about anything. How do you all cope with the hopelessness and feeling of being trapped in your own head all the time? At this point the general anxiety about having HA is almost as bad as the HA itself. ,Anxiety
35291,Painful hard lump behind ear.... Mastoiditis? I have this painful hard lump on my mastoid process that hard bone that's right behind the ear on only my right side. I literally just noticed it about an hour ago. It's tender to the touch and now I can feel dull pain in that spot without touching it. I have no idea if it's been there all day I didn't notice it at all.The closest thing I can find that it could be is mastoiditis. I have no other symptoms other than the fact that I noticed my hearing was slightly worse than my right ear a couple of times in today before I noticed the bump.I'm extremely scared and I don't have any support everyone around me writes things off as nothing. I keep reading things about needing antibiotics through an IV but I can't find very many people talking about mastoiditis... and obviously I don't even know if that's what it is exactly.has anyone heard of this or dealt with it??,Anxiety

35296,Health Anxiety Phobias I had posted this in the general anxiety sub someone pointed me to this sub in the comments so I'm crossposting here I'm new here. I've suffered with anxiety for as long as I can remember but it took an existential crisis for me to seek treatment about 10 years ago. I've been medicated ever since. The meds definitely help me feel more normal but I'm never 100 without anxiety. It's still always there. I have some chronic health problems and after suffering for years see a pattern here? I have finally gotten up the nerve to try to figure out what is wrong. For years I've told myself my symptoms are just anxiety related IBS body pain fatigue extreme migraines etc. It has now gotten to the point where I'm sick more often than not I'm missing a lot of work and I'm not able to be a good mother or wife. I'm spending most of my time in the fetal position in bed. I'm in pain all of the time sometimes so severe I can barely move. I'm losing weight without trying. I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality. The problem is I am really freaked out by doctors and all the associated medical testsprocedures. I have a GP who handles my anxiety meds and I see her regularly but I am awful at getting tests done and awful at seeing specialists .... even though I know logically that I need to go do these things to find out what is wrong with me so I can get better. In a moment of bravery I made myself appointments with all of the specialists I've been told to see over the years... gastroenterologist neurologist rheumatologist dentist and oral surgeon. I've gone to a couple of the appts and of course all of them want me to get tests done or bloodwork done. I feel paralyzed when I think about getting those things done. For example I have orders for bloodwork. I just have to walk into the lab and let them draw blood.... super easy and no big deal. I have driven myself there 5 times in the last week and been unable to force myself to walk through the door to get it done. I break out in a sweat panic and get back in the car and leave. Then I spend the rest of the day hating myself for it. Feeling like an idiot because I didn't get it done. My GI doctor also ordered an ultrasound which I forced myself to do I've had two kids and knew US were easy so this didn't freak me out as much. However she called me back to tell me that my US results are abnormal and that they might need to do a biopsy... so of course now I am absolutely freaking out. Does anyone else have this problem? I feel paralyzed and terrified over the simplest things and hate myself for it. I need to stop being such a coward and get this stuff done so I can figure out why I am so sick and try to fix it. ,Anxiety
35297,How to resist the tentation to search for symptoms on the internet? My counselor told me that all this searching on the internet to reassure myself it's only feeding my anxiety. She actually described this circle with a metaphor of a drug addict's addiction. So I'm trying to resist my impulses to look up for symptoms and I find it so hard I spend 8 hours in front of a computer for work and it's just so tempting to open a Google search which will lead me to WebMD to autodiagnose myself with MS RA or some other nasty stuff. Any advice?,Anxiety
35298,Fallingdropping sensation multiple times a day. Anxiety? Hi there. I'm anxious about this kind of new symptom I'm having right now... Its like a falling or dropping sensation mostly when I'm sitting but sometimes happens to me while I walk around. I can feel it during less than a second it feels like when you use an elevator to go up or down in a building you know HAT feeling you have when the elevetor starts to move. Anyone can relate? It's really strange but I don't even move when it happens it's just some kind of sensation.,Anxiety
35299,Mono nightmare Towards the beginning of 2019 I began feeling something weird in my throat as if a ball of mucus was stuck there. I thought it was allergies but never took any allergy medication. Fast forward to 1 week ago where I'm following a terrible flipped sleep schedule going to sleep at 10am and waking up at 6pm. I woke up at 4pm one day and was so tired that I ended up falling asleep at 10pm. After getting 9 hours of sleep I still remained tired throughout the day. I assumed it was due to my sudden shift in sleep schedules but the daytime fatigue continued. Eventually I scheduled a physical exam to see what was going on all while assuming the absolute worst case scenario. The doctor brought up mono as a possibility but I didn't think much of it.ampx200BAgain fast forward to today I receive a call from the doctor saying that my bloodwork came back positive for mono. I was shocked. But for some reason I've been having a heartchest pain that pops up for a few seconds at different times throughout the day and almost as it were to perfectly coincide with my diagnosis. Now there are some complications with mono such as heart inflammation however they are said to be quite rare. My hypochondria is immediately assuming that I am one of those rare cases and have developed a viral heart disease. Does anyone have an experience similar to this with mono? I would love to hear about it. ,Anxiety

35302,Ive been managing my health anxiety pretty well! .....until today So Im on 150mg of Zoloft daily along with Lamictal not certain about the dosage. Today I was taking my daily pills but I accidentally took an extra pill which I guess would mean I took 250mg. My mom called the pharmacist who said I should be fine but to look out for fainting. Ironically I felt lightheaded just seconds after realizing Id taken more than the prescribed dose. So Im guessing that was anxiety because no pill affects you that fast as far as Im aware.But technically it still is an overdose but a small one. Whenever I drink water it feels weird on my throat and theres a tickle in my throat though that could be a mix of allergies and anxiety. And when I got up at first I felt dizzy.I looked it up and it says that 200mg is usually the max dosage. I took 50mg more. Im afraid to sleep or anything. This happened around 5 hours ago. If Id overdosed on a fatal level would I have exhibited severe and obvious symptoms by now? Im just so paranoid now ,Anxiety

We didn't get home until 1230 and so that made me anxious knowing I wouldn't get the best sleep. I woke up multiple times through out the night and just shaking and when I woke up for the day I was drenched in a cold sweat.

35306,What triggers your palpitations and what do they feel like? So Ive been dealing with intermittent palpitations for the past 6 months or so. I havent had an EKG done yet just because Im in between doctors and my psychiatrist MD not therapist said she wasnt worried about them and thought they were fine when I told her about them. From what she told me and what Ive learned I think Ive been feeling ectopic beats. For me it feels kind of like my stomach drops like when youre in an elevator going down. I can also feel like the air is pushed out of my lungs and I feel a super faint little tap in my chest then my heartbeat goes back to normal. I sometimes feel adrenaline and lightheadedness right when it first happens but Im not sure if thats a physical response to the palpitation or if its my anxiety reacting. Ive never felt a run of any its always just a single missed beat that I feel when theyre bad I get 35 per day at most. Ive been trying really hard to figure out what triggers them for me and it seems to be correlated with breathing variance stress and posture. For instance I feel them most often if Im talking quickly and run low on breath and then take in a quick breath. I also feel them sometimes when bending over or bending backward. Also if Ive been sitting down and then stand up and stretch I can feel a tightness in my whole chest area and my heart will beat slow and hard and I can feel an ectopic if I move too quickly or breathe weird during this. I wanted to know if anyone else has these same triggers and if not then what are they and how do the palps feel? Im working on not worrying so much about mine but its comforting to know other people experience similar things. ,Anxiety

I know they are abnormal I have eyes I can read. Im just too tired right now. On top of the doctors I have debt collections from surgeries out the wazoo calling all day. I just hide from my phone on my room probably getting sicker. I just cant mentally and physically keep up with the constant anxiety and trips everywhere.

35310,So annoyed with myself...health anxiety resurgence Hey guysSo annoyed with myself even though I guess it isnt really my fault I used to have pretty bad health anxiety a few years ago. It started to subside somewhat after I got a scan done after I felt a lump it was just a cyst. Right around that time I was also immigrating from the UK to the US so my life got super busy and the health anxiety virtually went away. Ive been in the US for almost two years now and havent really had any big health worries since I got the scan done in England years ago...until this week. My wife passed onto me I guess some sort of virus and I had flu like symptoms of course a lymph node on my neck has swollen as is pretty topical with stuff like that and Im now convinced I have lymphoma. 0 to 60 in about a week unbelievable. This time feels different though when this sort of stuff happened in the past my rational thought was completely obscured to the point where any logical or rational thought would immediately be dismissed in favor of the worst case scenario but this time Im well aware how irrational Im being and Im well aware that its most likely just due to this infection. But Im still worrying. I made the mistake of Googling it and although Google does say that with cancerous lumps in the neck theyre typically immovable mine is movable Im still panicking!,Anxiety

35312,Health anxiety that has lead to panic disorder My health anxiety has led to panic disorder my panic attacks are almost daily now honestly. Me health anxiety has gotten worse over the course of college I used to get sick or feel something and go on about my day and not care too much. But now if I even get a cough or cold I think I have lung cancer or something lately Ive been short of breath anytime I try and do anything night just all be in my head but it makes me wanna just lay in bed. Im an active person I lift 56x a week been taking some time off here and there because of the anxiety and panic attacks. I noticed whenever I see something like a friend being diagnosed with pulmonary embolism that Ill look it up and then think I have it or feel a normal bodily sensation and get fixated on it and make everything worse until Im in panic mode. I would have to say the worst thing is being dizzy I feel like Im constantly dizzy most places leaving my house and it makes me uncomfortable and fear Ill pass out although this wouldnt happen bc my BP is normal at those times or high if anything. Id just like to know other health anxiety worries of people fears panic attack stories what youve done to cope? Because I have a lexapro prescription but not sure about it yet. Thanks!,Anxiety

35314,Anxiety the cause of fatigue and other symptoms? Hey guys! Normally I try to avoid seeking reassurance as much as possible but right now Im just too scared so I feel the need to share. Its quite a lot so please bear with me. Im a guy who has experienced all kinds of vague symptoms for about one and a half year. It all started when I experienced dizziness and nausea while exercising which was strange because I was a young and sporty guy. I then started experiencing the following symptoms on a daily basis chest painspalpitations dizzinessfeeling offbalance feeling like I cant take a full breath loss of appetite felt sick after one bite of food feeling like I would pass out without actually passing out worsening of symptoms in heatcold nervousness anxiety panic attacksI am especially worried about my heart and have had several ECGs 5 day Holter 2 stress tests and an echocardiogram. Apart from PACsPVCs which my cardiologist says are benign nothing bad was found. The diagnosis was hypochondriaanxiety. On the one hand it sounds believable to me as I have experienced social anxiety and body dysmorphia in the past. On the other hand I cant accept that its just anxiety because of the severity of the symptoms. Almost a year of therapy have not improved the symptoms much either.I dont experience fullblown panic attacks or chest pains as often as I used to. Instead I have been getting more palpitations and heavy fatigue. The fatigue is a relatively new symptom that started 4 months ago and it scares me the most. I usually have energy in the morning but from around 12 the fatigue sets in preventing me from doing anything. When I googled it I found out fatigue is linked to heart disease making me even more anxious. My doctor says that it is due to adrenal fatigue and lack of activity which finally leads to my question...Can such heavy fatigue really be caused by anxiety or a lack of activity I am scared to exercise and dont leave the house much? Is it possible that Im just experiencing some kind of burnout from being anxious for a over a year? I find it so hard to believe since Im also tired on days that Im seemingly not anxious.Thanks for bearing with my long story!Cheers!,Anxiety

Went to hospital they told me its a muscle cramp gave me naproxen and told me to go see a physio if it doesnt get any better.I wasnt getting any better after few weeks I started feeling really shit had fever dizziness blurry vision body aches awful stomach cramps bloating chills sweats and back ache. Went to the doctors got an ultrasound done and was diagnosed with a kidney infection had antibiotics for a week and they told me its clear after a check up. At this stage I was still getting daily stomach cramps and tightness especially in the left side of stomach hip and shoulder dizzy spells and blurry vision. After weeks of not caring the symptoms have improved now I only get tightness in left side of stomachback and light bloating sometimes it spreads to the hip or to the shoulder and I sometimes get dizzy spells but all the other symptoms are going. I wanna say that I constantly worry about the symptoms as it is there everyday and I havent been eating enough because of it all. Ive done so many tests at my doctors as well as few scans and everything comes up clear and they say Im healthy although I feel shit.Do you think I have developed health anxiety over this due to constant stress and worry and this is what causes the feeling of tightness and bloating that I get everyday? Has anyone experienced any physical symptoms similar to this due to health anxiety and constant worry or stress? ,Anxiety

35323,Health anxiety about Multiple Sclerosis? For the past year i have had neurological symptoms that lead me to googling then becoming fixated on MS. I started getting muscle twitches all over and on my mouth particularly then a tinglingbuzzing heel of my left foot muscle soreness on my arms tingling tip of nose and scalp various shooting pains and horrible neck pain. This was all on and off. My foot has been buzzing for months and months on and off. I had cancer when I was younger and my doctors think I just have health anxiety or neuropathy from old chemo which is uncommon anyways i got a new doctor and she scared me more because she told me it doesnt sound like full blown MS but i can do some tests basically even though she said it didnt sound like it she still didnt rule it out. that was enough to scare me into a spiraling panic. I google my symptoms every day read up On MS and im fully convinced i have it. I even posted on the MS forum here but now I wonder if it could all just be anxiety. Im terrified. Ive been obsessing over this for a year now. I havent had any debilitating symptoms like numbess or pins and needles or vision loss.

35326,Can health anxiety cause coldlike symptoms? Hey guys!Let me start off by saying that I suffer from pretty strong health anxiety but have recently started therapy to deal with it.Three weeks ago the very week I started therapy I caught a cold. It was a very difficult week as I pretty much thought I was dying.Anyway it has been two weeks since it has passed and since then Ive had pain in my throat on and off moving in different places in my throat sometimes the left side sometimes the right side sometimes the soft palate sometimes nothing at all. Yesterday after being very stressed out about some work things the pain came back in the right side of my throat pretty strong. This morning I woke up and now the left side is hurting and I have a ton of mucus insiste my nose too.Could my brain really be making all of this up? Does anyone suffer from throat pain from health anxiety?Sorry for the reassurance post guys Im just really tired of thinking about all this and I never google anything because I feel like Ill start feeling everything I read.,Anxiety
35328,Scared of bad diseases and death in the young ages Hello everyoneI'm a medical student 22 yo and it's about 2 year that I'm suffering from anxiety about my health. I think about my body and symptoms almost every hour of the day. I'm always scared about that i have a bad disease and will it kill me or something.I usually experience physical symptoms and I can't really find out whether this symptoms are real or only because of my anxiety.Over the past 2 years I experienced lots of symptoms all over my body now I'm experiencing stomach problems and sleep problems visited lots of doctors and took lots of medicine. Now its for a few months that i started to feel depressed and lost my motivations. Don't now what to do at all.I will be happy if you share some ideas. Tnx,Anxiety
35329,I'm freaking out Yesterday I was hanging out with my buddy things haven't been good for either of us. I told him how two people that I knew died this week and my great aunt tested positive for cancerous cells . His birthday is coming up and he saw how depressed I was and wanted to smoke weed with me. I haven't smoked weed in a while and said screw it we were smoking I went to the bathroom I come out and find out his mom took a hit. Now I didn't know this and I know they smoke together my HA has been under control but unfortunately Now my mind is running all over the place panicking worrying about diseases. Now I'm not saying they have diseases I can't stop worrying about it. For example we were using a bowl and a bong we were passing to each other now I'm worrying about shit like Hepatitis or HIV and stuff like that. Again I'm not saying they have because when I did smoke with them before I was perfectly fine but my HA won't stop me from over thinking and going worst case scenario.,Anxiety

35333,Scared of Crohn's Disease I had a canker sore in my mouth two weeks ago it has healed now but I just thought what if it comes back. I have no idea if I have had this feeling for a long time but just now noticed it that I kinda feel like the roof of my mouth is burning and it stops when I don't pay attention to it. I have always had some problems with my stomach they have gotten better in last two years male 19 yo now. I have had a gastroscopy before but never gotten a colonoscopy because that makes me anxious. Gastroscopy showed that I have no reflux and everything looks good biopsies from my duodenum came back normal no coeliac disease or other diseases. I just can't stop worrying if I have an IBD and that is what is causing my mouth symptoms. Would Crohn's disease show on the biopsies taken from my duodenum? I just feel like it would be real unlikely because noone in my family never have had an IBD and I don't smoke Apparently smokers are twice as likely to develop Crohn's than nonsmokers. ,Anxiety
35334,Lumps on neck and head now. Okay so first of all thank you for reading this I am struggling with bad anxiety right now. I have had two lumps on the side of my neck for 2 years now and have been told in the past by a doctor that they were nothing. I was put on antibiotics which didn't seem to help and sent away. I recently had them checked out again and the doctor ordered an ultrasound which I have yet to go to to make sure they weren't cancer. I have zero symptoms otherwise. Fast forward to now I have a larger lump on the back left side of my scalp. I'm trying to tell myself it's just a cyst but the anxious pattern seeking side of me is having a hard time time letting it go. It's larger than the other two and is hard and hurts a little when I apply pressure. There are a few causes I can think of It's just a cyst and completely unrelated to my other two swollen lymph nodes. My fathet has a history of cysts which may account for mine.I'm pretty sure I remember hitting my head on something about a week ago so it could just be a bruise of sorts. memory isn't clearCancer. I'm gonna die hit the panic button ect...I recently have been having allergies or a cold which could be due to an infection which could be making my lymph nodes react. This is the way my anxious mind sees it I must have cancer because there is now a third lump to add on the other two I've had for years. I've left it untreated for so long that I'm scared to even go to a doctor. Now it must be spreading to my brain which would probably make it inoperable. I will get brain cancer and die at 19 due to my lack of action.I'm honestly having trouble deciphering hypochondria from reality.I'm hoping someone besides myself could make a determination as to whether or not I'm blowing this out of proportion. Thank you.I'm also worried that in trying to niaevely make myself feel better by posting this. ,Anxiety

35336,HA with starting new medications A few years ago I was placed on a mood stabilizer to treat BPD and the first night that I took it I got extremely dizzy my heart rate spiked and I spent the next two days in bed unable to think straight because everything was just fuzzy and I couldn't concentrate or find the energy to function.Ever since I've been petrified of starting new medications. A few times now my psychiatrist has put me on something and I didn't even start taking it because I would take to the internet to doublecheck possible side effects and suddenly become too afraid to. I always worry starting something new wondering if this one will have another frightening effect if I'll have an allergic reaction if it'll interfere with my heart condition etc basically I always end up terrified to start taking something because I'm convinced it will be dangerous or at least will make me feel worse than whatever it's treating.Today after seeing my psychiatrist again I've been given a new prescription this time for Strattera to treat the ADHD I just got diagnosed with very recently. Strattera is the onlysafest option for me right now as stimulants definitely will aggravate my heart condition. But so many people online I peeked around rADHD and a few other places say it made them feel absolutely horrible with more side effects than benefits and now I'm back to being terrified to take it.Has anyone else struggled with this at all? Is there a way around it?,Anxiety
35337,'IcePick Headaches year long' Hey!So I was wondering whether some of you could help me out. For the last year I have been experiencing a weird sensation at the backtop of my head the closest thing I can describe it to being an 'IcePick Headache'. Originally I was having it a few times a week and I would get these sensations a few times a day lasting only 25 seconds. However this has now reduced to once a week on average. During the last year I have been to the doctors about this issue a few times mentioning the almost 'pinching' sensation that occurs. However on none of these occasions have any followup appointments been scheduled each doctor suggesting there is absolutely nothing to worry about and suggesting they could be a symptom of anxiety or tension. For a few months it hasn't worried me as much but has been in the back of my head quite literally! and I decided to make another appointment for today. Again I was told the same thing but was prescribed with an antiinflammatory medicine.Have any of you experienced similar symptoms and do you have any advice?fyi 21 year old male who has never had real issues with headachesmigraines.Much appreciated.,Anxiety
35338,Freaking out over HIV So a little over a year ago I was hooking up with this guy. We had unprotected sex vaginal and anal. I had gotten sick twice with flu like symptoms during the brief few months we hooked up. I also had to get surgery to remove an ovary due to a cyst and they did all the general blood work then and everything looked fine. Fast forward to two weeks ago I had a swollen lymph node but didnt feel sick. Ignored it. I woke up this morning to a rash on my breast and I dont know where it came from. It doesnt hurt or itch its just red. I went to urgent care this morning and she told me I was fine and couldnt feel my lymphnodes but to come back in three days if the rash doesnt go away. I had just gotten another general health panel done on my blood a month ago and was told I was completely healthy. Well after doing research I found out that general health panels dont screen for HIV. So now Im freaking out. I had the lymphnode and now the rash and I think I have tongue thrush. Not severe or anything but my tongue definitely looks whiter than usual. Im going to get tested this week but Im so fucking scared. I feel like an idiot for not knowing that general health panels dont screen for STIs. I havent lost a significant amount of weight or but I do sleep a lot more but I thought that was just from my depressionanxiety. Im terrified ,Anxiety
35339,Rash on breast I woke up this morning to a rash on my right breast. Immediately went to urgent care and she told me to come back in three days if it doesnt get better.

Would a general health panel be able to detect cancer or other underlying diseases? ,Anxiety
35340,Convinced something is wrong with my headbrain I posted this to raskdocs already but figured l'd share here too.I'll start by saying l got diagnosed with severe GAD anxiety about a year ago and l've noticed l've become a huge hypochondriac since then. Lately l've been noticing a few things that have me convinced there's something wrong.One is that when l run my hand over my head l feel a lot of hard bumpsdivits on my skull that l don't remember always being there and l haven't hit my head recently. I know it's normal to have a few small bumps but I have one on the top of my head that seems out of the ordinary and l don't know if that should be of concern or not.The other is that I will randomly get sharp bursts of pain in isolated areas of my head that feel like bad headaches but only last for like a minute or so. This has been scaring me into thinking l might have brain problemstumors. I also will feel shakey but it's only in my head and not all over. I sometimes will get slight numbingtingling sensations on my head ears and side of face. Like l mentioned before l have anxiety so l know some of these could just be anxiety related issuessymptoms but it seems like something is wrong to me. I don't want to waste my money in getting scans of my brain if unnecessary but I still am concerned.I'm a 21 year old female overall healthy besides the anxiety and mild depression. Any feedback or concerns would be greatly appreciated!,Anxiety

35345,Terrified of ALSMS or some kind of serious neurological condition I am a 24yearold male. I'm overweight but otherwise healthy as of a full physical with CBC 6 months ago. I usually go for a walk for about a half hour during my lunch break. I guess about 3 weeks ago I went out and I felt very tired after a few minutes. My legs were burning and I felt like I had to like drag them. After that I freaked out about what could be wrong with me. Since then I dread lunchtime because I go for a walk feel tired and get very anxious afterwards as a result. The whole time I'm walking I'm thinking I'm going to collapse or I'm not going to be able to make to back to the office etc. Today I went out and my left leg felt worse than my right which is why I started to fear ALS because I readf It affects one limb worse than the other. The muscle in the front of my calf was burning so much I felt like I had to drag it. The whole afternoon I sat at my desk flexing my legs and it feels like the right one is stronger. I know I'm out of shape and need to lose weight but I've never had problems like this before as a result of my anxiety. I'm going to make an appointment to go to the doctor tomorrow morning but I'm the meantime I'm just imagining hearing I have ALS and only have a few years to live. ,Anxiety
35346,I dont understand why my sickness wont go away. Im starting to think I might have neck or throat cancer. Two months ago I went to the doctor due to a cough and a caught up stuffy head Ive had for literally 23 months straight. The doctor gave me decongestants and antibiotics to tackle infections. 1 month later I still have the cough and I developed really bad mouth ulcers which made it extremely difficult to eat or even talk along with a lump developing under my jaw which was supposedly a swollen lymph node. I got a blood test taken. I also had constant tiredness. I got acid reflux then in between all of this which I also got medicine for. Its cured now.I got prescribed medicine again and I got rid of the ulcers and the soreness in my mouth. The lump under my jaw disappeared and my blood tests said I was perfectly fine but I still dont feel right. Another lump has just grown on the right side of my neck this time and my cough and stuffy head is STILL effecting me. Im really starting to worry that this might be something very serious. Why cant I just become fully healthy? Its been months almost 4 months now. Im going back to the doc again on Friday and this time Im going to tell her my concerns. ,Anxiety
35347,Itchy Skin and Lymph Nodes. Google Results Are F Scaring Me. Hey Guys! Im new to this SubReddit but I found myself worrying about minor medical issues since I was a young teenager Im 24.I have three small hard lymph nodes in the back of my neck and behind my ear. Since five days my skin is itchy without an apparent rash. I called my GP and went to the ER three days ago. Dr. just told me the lymph nodes are fine but didnt address my itchiness even though he asked where I feel it. When I googled my symptoms I started crying lymphoma blood cancer etc.. Im married and have a son and also Im a student and workout and live actually quiet healthy compared to most people I know. I have no other symptoms but Im sure I have cancer.

35348,Dealing with health anxiety for years... and how Im learning to move on from it Im no expert and I know everyone is different but Ive come a long way with my health anxiety and wanted to share a little of what I learned. On mobile excuse format and typosI once read something along the lines of our brain believes everything we tell it so if we start filling it with doubt and anxiety we create a world that is simply not true A year ago and I was telling myself every little symptom meant imminent death I worried about brain cancer breast cancer blood cloths etc etc etc. Im still in the process of completely desensitize myself from the most minimal sensations and Im still trying to learn how to really understand what my body is trying to tell me this is kind of how I learned to deal with it again I know not everyone is the same but hopefully this will be useful for someone If I can distract myself from the sensation or discomfort then its anxiety I call them sensations because any little thing I feel I wanna convince myself is pain even if its not. I try to ignore it if thats the case. My doctor always told me small sensations or symptoms are not a sign of anything serious.If its interrupting your day to day then take something for your symptom and try to move on eg. you have a sore throat then get something specifically for that If over the counter meds dont do it and its well over a week or so then Ill call my Doctor explain whats going on and see if I can come in for some answers and peace of mind. If you have multiple terrible symptoms then of course go check with your doctor asap. But the main thing is breathe friend. Dont freak out immediately dont google about it try to accept the thought and the sensations as exactly that thoughts and sensations and nothing more theyre not a sign of anything. Ironically life is not guaranteed for anybody no matter what but looking for symptoms constantly means youre wasting something you want to hold on to so desperately. Think about that I do it everyday. ,Anxiety

But when I get anxious about them a lot I feel like I notice little pin pricks of light in my vision and other symptoms but no loss of peripheral vision. I had pink eye at the beginning of this year and I think that may have been the culprit of these floaters cause they only really became visible after then but I just need some reassurance that everything is fine and will be fine. ,Anxiety

If I were to describe the pain it feels like it's my entire body with the most painful part being my ribtorso area. I was wondering if this is normal? Any thoughts?

It's even more hellish than health anxiety I've had about physical health problems because there is no definitive test one professional could say I have it and the other could disagree for example there is no objective qualification for whether I have it and I'm scared to even bring it up to a professional because I don't want to plant the seed in their mind and be treated worse because it's so highly stigmatized. It's gotten completely obsessive. I'm really unsure of what to do. ,Anxiety
35362,Everyone has cancer and it freaks me out. Ive been having a lot of cancer surrounding my friends and family as time passes I become more and more afraid of when it is going to inevitably strike close to home.

35363,Weird I'm fine. So over the last week or so I've had some symptoms. My tongue was sensitive and burned. Mild aching in my jaw. Cheek was kind of torn up and raw. My SO was leaving across the country for a week when these symptoms showed up. They got worse until she got back. So things have died down then yesterday I sort of run my jaw on the right side. Sure as shit there's a mass or lump of some sort. I go into full panic mode through my whole work shift and into the night. In all lasting about 7 or 8 hours. So I call the dentist this morning. Get fit in somewhere. It's about an hour drive for me to get there. Nerves going crazy the whole time. Thinking the worst case scenario as usual. I go in I get into a room. They take some xrays. The assistant says hes going to get the doc and he'll be back. At this point to me its mouth cancer or some crazy abcess. The doc comes in I explain my HA to him. He looks around a bit and God damn. It's a fucking canker sore. My lymphnodes are a tad swollen and that's what he said I felt. I could tell they were trying not to laugh at the fool who'd just spent 100 dollars to look at a canker sore. Honestly it is funny though and hella relieving. Just a good ol case of the HA. Keep on powering through folks. It's usually never as bad as it seems. Love ya people ,Anxiety
35364,my neck is constantly cracking! so my neck has been constantly cracking for a long time now but now its even more frequent than it used to be. i can also MOVE bits and pieces in the back of my neck which feels like small pieces of bone. i saw a doctor for this she basically diagnosed me as overly anxious about my health that it is all a mental thing. i agree in this because i AM always anxious about my health.when my neck cracks which is with many movements not just occasionally but VERY frequently i dont really feel any pain but it does worry me a lot.my neck cracking gets worse when i am in certain positions or if i sit down on a chair for a long time.sometimes with the pains i feel like sharp stabbing pains occasionally in my head or wherever it may be i am starting to feel overly anxious about them because i wonder if it could be because of my neck.im only 17 but i have very bad posture and a sedentary lifestyle for many years now.i am mostly concerned about the bits and pieces that i can shift in the back of my neck they feel like tiny pieces of bone and i can move them around. everyone ive asked about this does not relate to what im saying at all! i also get headaches nearly every day i have a bit of scoliosis and tmj so i wonder if this is related at all.i just dont feel like this is normal and its really making me anxious lately so if anyone else experiences constant cracking and crunching in their neck tell me! and are you able to move little pieces that feel like bone in the back of your neck? if anyone can help me alleviate this anxiety i will be extremely grateful!,Anxiety
35365,Tell me your success stories Quick BioMy Dad was diagnosed with MS when I was 23 shortly after having my first baby. It rocked my world. I saw the strongest man in my life quickly deteriorating and it hit me that illnesses happen to young people. This kicked off health anxiety for me and Ive been struggling ever since. Ive been convinced that Ive had MS Parkinsons neuro diseases. lots of various cancers. Im a compulsive checker if I feel a lump or bump. I check it constantly. Ive had panic attacks that last for days. Most of these symptoms have always gone away with starting and restarting ssris. Basically my anxiety has given me symptoms that mimic diseases. My mind is obviously not healthy as if I even hear the word cancer I can feel the anxiety build. If people I know are going through something health related or even if I see a young person going through cancer treatment it triggers it. Its even branching to my kids. Every headache or complaint I start panicking about something worse than a headache or virus. I cant sleep I obsess and theyre starting to notice my compulsions and worries. Its entirely illogical and overall just really bad for my health. I dont want to live like this. I hate being on SSRIs. I have sexual side effects and I dont feel like myself. I think they help but even on them Im susceptible to panic over things. Ive tried meditating medications yoga exercise. Ive overhauled my diet. I lift weights and cardio 3x a week. I use CBD oil. My question is this a life long thing? Has anyone overcome this and lived more normally? Has therapy helped you? And if so how? I just dont see how talking about it will help. How have you overcome this? Im so tired. ,Anxiety
35366,Hypochondria as an early symptom of dementia? I decided to take a break from scaring myself to death with medical craziness online and for once actually wanted to learn about Hypochondria I guess you could say it was an eye opening moment where I myself saw myself from a logical standpoint. As I sifted through the Google pages I ended up coming across a slew of articles relating to Hypochondria being one of the earliest signs of Frontotemporal Lobe Dementia and Lewy Body Dementia. My first initial reaction was complete anger. I had abused my Google privileges for so long looking at the scariest possible diseases. The one time I do exactly what people have been telling me to do dude look up what ANXIETY does to your body and mind not this I get forced back into hell. As you can imagine I checked it out. There were actually many articles and case reports regarding it that it kinda scared me. I had been worried specifically about dementia for the past month for a bunch of oddandend reasons..and then Google relays the term in reference to my hypochondriaanxiety...? It is the coincidence now that is flipping me out and confirming my fear even more. That is some bizarre..not even intentional coincidence dont you think? How do you even distinguish the difference between hypochondria as a VERY early symptom of dementia vs hypochondria because you are a hypochondriac?,Anxiety

Kept putting off any screening colonoscopy for fear of the procedure and for fear Id be right. Finally got it done and woo nothings wrong! Turns out my anxiety was actually 90 of the cause behind horrible intestinal upset for yeaaars. So that subsides finally and I can get back to normal. Til now. About a week ago I discovered a swollen what I presume to be a lymph node on my upper thighgroin crease area. About the size of a grape hard and moveable. Doesnt hurt until I start messing with it. Ive had a lymph node in my neck that swells up occasionally happening since childhood apparently its normal and it feels like that.

35370,Anxiety over tests Hi there aside from therapy wondering if any of you could share advice about how to get over anxiety when doing medical tests. I recently had an ultrasound and was in tears during it bc I had convinced myself that something scary would be found. It was to the point that the radiologist came to talk to me and gave me the results on the spot. I greatly appreciated this but I understand is not possible every time. I have a follow up MRI scheduled for next week likely to confirm an incidentaloma and Im having a VERY hard time. Ive rescheduled it twice and I dread the two days I will have to wait for the results. The anxiety is crippling. Thanks for reading and any advice you can give me. ,Anxiety

35373,Health Anxiety Effects English is not my first language so apologies for any grammar mistakes. So I've been having Health Anxiety mostly due to the apparition of a dark spot in my stomach and some sores in my scalp. Initially I didn't worry about it but it started spreading and I was convinced that it was some cancer tumor. That coupled with upset stomach made me live day after day with anxiety about my health. It's been two months with this anxiety I've been to the doctor and he said I have a healthy stomach besides my colon being upset and having a infection. I'm on medication for that. Been to two different dermatologist for the spot in my chest said it was dermatitis and got medication for it. Still I'm anxious about my health and been feeling dizzy lately. I been coping with my parents divorce economic issues and think I might have depression. What are the effects of Health Anxiety? Think it might be worsening my health,Anxiety

35375,More anxious when on meds that are helping you? I don't mean anxiety meds. I'm dealing with Crohn's and have recently had an iron infusion and my first round of Entyvio. Since then I've been feeling some new things most likely side effects and I've been paranoid about them being something else. Since I had the iron infusion I've been having night sweats every night. Not drenching but kind of muggy and enough to notice that something's off. Then I started the Entyvio and my appetite has taken a plunge as well as nausea coming onto me at random points. Been more thirsty too. I feel feverish but only in my head. Extremities aren't cold and I'm not shivering but I do have chills anxiety?. I keep getting paranoid about lymphoma since I used to be on Humira and that can cause it. Or maybe some kind of abdominal abscess forming. It's been taking over my thoughts and actions since this all started happening and I don't know if I'm thinking clearly. When I wasn't on anything for Crohn's I had no cares in the world it seemed and even though I had pain I knew what was causing it. It wasn't something I thought about. Now it feels like I can't pinpoint what's doing what. Even talking to my doctor I feel like it's just brushed over as nothing. How do I go about not worrying about every thing I'm feeling?,Anxiety

35377,Coping Methods Backfired Hi all just hoping to get some feedback on how to proceed. I got an IUD in mid January and had my follow up ultra sound in February. A few weeks after getting the iud I started feeling this strange twinge in my lower left pelvis. Of course having gone through this countless times I began to do what Ive been working on with my counselor which is essentially using mindfulness to talk myself off the ledge of thinking I was dying. I actually felt relatively calm while I was having my exam but then my doctor tells me I have a complex cyst on my left ovary and I felt anxiety come crashing down on me. The ultrasound was 27 of this year and since that day I cant stop obsessing over this cyst and Im determined its cancer and that Im dying. My doctor even said it was nothing to stress about and that Id have a follow up in 2 months to see if its changedgone away. That hasnt helped and Im still so scared. Its too the point where Im getting heart palpitations and every twinge of my body makes me feel like my ovarian cancer has spread to wherever Im feeling it. Anyone have any advice? I feel completely at a loss because I feel like I can no longer rely on my coping method.,Anxiety

Ive gone to the doctor and they usually take one look at me and say I look young and healthy and its all good. Theyve never done any kind of tests on me unless I argued it. I got an ECG last year for my heart and it was normal. But I have had pain in my heart area for over a year now and its progressively worse. The last few months I have major brain fog headaches I feel extremely weak and my muscles in my chest and back have these weird.... things. They feel loose or.. I dont know. They just hurt really badly sometimes. It feels like needles pulling them apart and its weird.I just feel very unwell and every time I go to the doctor I feel Like they think Im a hypochondriac.

I have been recently diagnosed with spasmophiliasevere anxiety it all begin a month ago when i suddenly had a panic attack right before bed and i am pretty sure it was heart related I have been scared for a while to have any heart disease and i am obviously completely freaked out about sudden death heart attack and stuff. I have been quite deep into anxiety i could not walk without freaking out and my heart rate was going crazy ! I has dizziness headaches palpitations nausea tiredness chest pain blurry vision heavy stomach feeling pressure in my throat and neck an oppressing feeling in my throat like i was suffocating hot flash and short breath.Doctors said we found nothing you are fine. Yeah but nothing stopped ... how can they tell me i have nothing when i feel so bad ? Anyway back to other doctor you have spasmophilia known as severe anxietystress. What happened ? I have no idea ...My cardiologist gave me propanolol after running exams that all came back good ! I feel better yes i can go to work talk walk. Nevertheless i still feel oppressed i have shortbreath crazy stomach pain i think it is acid reflux but not sure it feels like i am swallowing too much air and i have those weird heart palpitations where all of a sudden it misses a beat and then burst in a new beat it nearly cut my breath ! But again cardiologist said i had nothing after an echograpghy and a 24h ECG. It needs to stop. Everytime i think i am getting better something else appears and makes me feel down again. Sorry for the long post guys but ill take any advise you ll have for me ! Thanks ,Anxiety
35382,Wanted to share one of my coping methods in case any of you find it helpful Recently I've been thinking a lot about about my health anxiety and I think one of the main reasons why I am so afraid of contracting whatever disease it happens to be on any given week is because I automatically catastrophize the situation. If I think I might have breast cancer I automatically think it will kill me. I imagine saying my last goodbyes to my family and friends and think of all the things I will never achieve in my life because I've died young. To reassure myself I tell myself that I'm making it up it my head I don't have cancer it's so unlikely at my age etc. This reassurance is only fleeting before I find another 'symptom' and the cycle continues.But lately I've been realising that one of the main problems is that I underestimate my ability to cope with health problems. There are hundreds of thousands of cancer survivors who end up living long and happy lives. People who are HIV positive can live relatively normal lives despite their illness thanks to modern medicine. Having an illness does not mean the end of the world. By reframing my thinking when reassuring myself from 'I don't have x disease I'm OK' to 'I probably don't have x disease but if I do I know I will find a way to cope with it and I will be ok' I have found that health anxiety worries have come up less frequently as the intrusive thoughts have less to hold on to. ,Anxiety

I was doing SO WELL these past couple of weeks but I can not stop worrying about the possibility of me becoming a zombie!

Financially I can't really move until May. I take 3 different kinds of antihistamines daily a combo inhaler clean constantly bc of the dust and run two air purifiers and a dehumidifier. I'm still not better. There's a vent in our bathroom maybe going to the ceiling of the upper unit bathroom and eventually out into the roof but that's it for ventilation. I think the people above have a cat and I'm allergic to cats but I'm not sure if the allergens can travel like that? Either way it's like I have legit ocd now about dust mold and cats. I'm constantly cleaning everything in an attempt to feel better and I keep getting worse. Drs give me more pills that do nothing. I think I am slowly losing it. Should I just start living in a hotel until I can figure it out? Move back home? I don't really have money so I'd have to probably move back in with my parents. All bc my partner had to live a pet friendly dusty old building which I clean ALL the time and still sick. What are my options as tenant and what can I do to get better other than leave?

35391,Do you ever just feel one lymph node? Then you feel more and more? Seems like its common for someone to feel lymph nodes unilaterally especially on the neck. In my case it has always been the right side of my neck.Ive felt one below my lower right jaw for several years. I started feeling again and finding more and theyre all on the right side still. A nice little stiff one around the posterior cervical area. Then today I found a pretty big soft one in the supraclavicular area feels very long and narrow like an oversized Mike n Ike. Now Ive freaked myself out. I was never worried about my lymph nodes until now since Ive been able to feel more of them in a descending pattern on one side only. I suppose the good thing is that theyre not big enough that you could see the lumps in a picture or mirror. I seldom have an intense itch attack on my lower legs and abdomen. Id say just a few occasions every couple months brought on by some physical activity. Last stomach itch I remember happened after a bike ride at night in the summer.Edit Had a pretty intense scratching session on my calf after I said this.Night sweats have happened but are rare as well. They always seem to happen when I cover myself up in a certain throw blanket so I switched to a more silky blanket and reduced the problems. Thinking way too ahead now I know most common lymphomas are treatable but its a matter if my insurance will cover the treatment and what I must do if they wont. I could just hope its nothing though instead of stressing about potentially nonexistent financial burdens. ,Anxiety

35394,Health anxiety by proxy anyone? So I think it started last summer when my husband got appendicitis. He denied the need to go to the ER for some time until finally I made him call for medical help. They came but they were unable to diagnose him so they just gave him a pain shot and left. After this I finally made it home and after a brief examination of his abdomen I was totally sure it was his appendix. So you could have guessed by now I have a health anxiety and have had it all my life. And it's actually severe and affects my life hugely. Almost all of my family are medics so I know a lot but I myself is not a doctor at all. So I called for medical help again and I made them take him and I insisted on the operation though they weren't sure because my husband's symptoms were so smudged because of the drug they gave him. It was an appendicitis the surgery was almost at the last moment before it would burst. But it was a minor surgery and after a few days he was totally fine he just got 3 really small scars. And know my health anxiety went fully blown out on him because it seems if I hadn't this anxiety and the knowledge it gave me my husband could have been in a way worse situation. So I'm anxious over his every headache and all. I'm like a crazy mom lol. When I think something bad can happen to him I cry and I always fear the worst. It stresses me a lot sometimes.,Anxiety
35395,Colon Cancer symptoms for 1.5 months Hello guys I hope Im in the correct sub please direct me if Im not. Im 22 and have no family history of colon cancer.Around mid January I started having extremely large amounts of diarrhea probably like 45 times a day. Within 2 weeks I was still having diarrhea but now blood started showing up and now every time apart from 12 here and there I have blood in my stool. Within the last week Im still going 45 times a day but half of those are usually to pass mucus and blood nothing else. The rest of the time I still pass mucus and blood but with normal stool. It might be stress related because collegework is pretty hectic but I manage and I have no other stress symptoms.I went to my doctor around 2 weeks ago and he said there was nothing he can do so he scheduled a GI appointment which is finally coming this Tuesday. The problem is that I read cancer stories from people my age and they all say they initially got passed off by several doctors because of their age group and they dont get the diagnosis until they finally get a colonoscopy so I will make sure I get one.What do you guys think?,Anxiety

35397,Breast cancer anxiety As the title suggests my HA specialty is breast cancer. I do not have a family history of it Im 33 and live a very active healthy life. But I live in almost constant fear of finding a lump and being given a death sentence. Like they are ticking time bombs. I check myself daily during the bad HA cycles usually tied to menstrual cycle and in several extra dark times have convinced myself my ribs muscle tissue etc. are lumps. Always to be reassured by my OB that they arent and that Im low risk and completely healthy. It makes me crazy though. Sometimes I even feel breast pain which Im pretty sure is psychosomatic because when Im busypreoccupied I dont feel the pain. But when I obsess I feel it constantly and live in a loop of crazy anxiety. Im driving my husband nuts and the worrying often robs me of other joys. But I dont know how to overcome this. I guess Im just wondering if anyone else has this particular worry and if theyve had any success getting past it. ,Anxiety

Im new to this sub and Reddit in general. 33F history of HA and panic disorder but it has been fairly well controlled for the last decade. Since last fall Ive had chest abdominal pain. Doctor thought it was GERD but I havent responded to multiple PPIs. I recently had a full cardiology workup and it was clear. Normally cardiology tests would really excite me but this time I honestly didnt think it was my heart.The pain is worsening and Im so discouraged. Its a constant burning and I cant find any relief with a bland diet or medicine. Endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound were normal. Im beginning to think theyll never find out whats wrong. Its almost to the point I want pain medicine and thats not me.I do realize the impact anxiety can have especially on the digestive system but Im in constant pain. It feels like theres more to this. Im fearful of tests continuing to come back normal theyll blame my anxiety and depression and Ill continue to suffer. Thanks for listening.,Anxiety

I feel like it's gotten worse and fear that I have some sort of disease that makes my retina deteriorate and it's just gonna keep getting worse until I'm blind. I scheduled an appointment to have it checked out but it's in a few weeks time. Part of me suspects I'm just anxious about my future but it's really hard to distract myself since most activities involve using my eyes and I'm obsessovely checking if my field of view has gotten worse or look for macular degeneration symptoms.

35401,Afraid of hospital infection Well I do not want to rationalize my fear of hospital infection however if we look at the stats hospital infection rates are significantly higher than before. I will have an arthroscopic knee debridement surgery the procedure just needs two 48 mm incisions basically. Usually patient would be discharged after a few hours of waking up or stay one night at hospital in some cases. I know in every surgery there is a chance of infection and I know that my surgery is one of the easiest surgeries available too. However I am really afraid to get an hospital infection. I had 4 surgeries before but the nearest one was 7 years ago when I was 17 years old. I am almost 5 inches taller64' and 100 pounds heavier now300lbs currently. I mean when we put all those things together these make me anxious. To sum upI am really scared of hospital infection even though my surgery is pretty easy and incisions will be just 8 mm max.I am slightly afraid of anesthesia since my body changed a lot in last 7 years.What are your thoughts?

35405,I'm afraid to have any tests done so I don't go to the doctor Hi things aren't going well I don't know if this is health anxiety related but I have a problem with having any tests done. Where it's not health anxiety is that I know I don't live a healthy lifestyle. My cholesterol was 230 in 2015. I haven't been tested since. I couldn't deal with a diagnosis. I barely make it day to day with my depression and yet I've already diagnosed myself with type 2 diabetes sleep apnea Grave's disease sometimes bowel OR colon cancer sometimes I have bloody stool a permanent heart defect that I'm convinced I have from taking too much immodium poor man's methadone back when I was addicted to opiates. I honestly think I'm dying and I'm only 30. But even though I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder I am sure I have most of those things because my body is slowly turning itself on me. But I think I'd rather die than be diagnosed with anything. I know that sounds insane but I've battled mental health and then later addiction for most of my life. I don't have enough to live for if I have some terrible disease. There would be no real support network. So I don't want a diagnosis if I know I'd rather die than have to deal with it. ,Anxiety
35406,Adrenaline surges all day Recently I have been getting that feeling all day of when you get scared like your stomach drops and you get the rush which I believe to be my adrenal glands firing but I could be wrong. What happens next is my brain starts to think that its my adrenal glands so naturally I start having pain in my kidney area .. dealing with these rushes all week.. now that its settled down it feels for like muscle pain where I perceive the kidneys to be even located. Is my mind playing tricks on me? Im worried that its like adrenal fatigue or something but every time I go to the doctor they just say its stress. Meditation positive affirmations and yoga have been helping.,Anxiety
35407,Worried about Toxic Shock Because Im an irresponsible idiot Thursday I started my period no big deal there. Friday night my husband and I went out to grab drinks and dinner to celebrate his new job. I had put a tampon in and since it was a light one completely forgot and we had sex. Neither or us felt the tampon probably due to alcohol. Saturday morning comes and Im off running errands. I put a tampon in on top of the one already in there bc I never sleep with a tampon in so It was habit. I changed it normally throughout the day. When I got into bed at 11pm Saturday night I had a weird feeling I left my tampon in from Friday. I go to the bathroom and I had. I removed it put a pad on and went to sleep. Now Im worried sick Ive got Toxic Shock Syndrome.SO yesterday Im tired which honestly probably was due to a busy weekend and the fact that I get up at 4 am MF for work. Last night I was nauseous and dizzy falling asleep. However I had just remembered those were symptoms of TSS then started having them. This morning I felt some nausea and a headache. I get frequent headaches from sleeping like an idiot with my neck but Im worried because its together. Logically the nausea is the fact that Im presenting to the entire leadership team today at work but of course I go back to I just have TSS and this is the beginning. Im so worried and now Im afraid Ill blow this presentation. I just started a new role so my health insurance doesnt kick in until April. I would absolutely go to the doctor or ER if I was certain I had TSS and not just bad anxiety. ,Anxiety
35408,Routine eye checkup for first pair of glasses revealed cotton wool spot Or at least that's what the optometrist said it most likely was. I've been suffering from astigmatism and double vision since I briefly took accutane and then a week before my followup appointment my right eye developed a large curved floater in my peripheral vision. It flashes blue in response to bright lights sometimes it even flashes when I'm laying in bed with my eyes closed. I mentioned it at my appointment got my right eye dilated and boom... white spot in my nerve layer. Didn't have it on my checkup 12 days prior. He said it was nothing to really worry about but classified it as most likely being a cotton wool spot which is usually found in people with hypertension andor diabetes. Told me it'd most likely work itself out but to come back in a month. If it's not better by then off to my doctor for bloodwork. Great. I've hardly been able to sleep at all...have therapy today forgot what time it's at and I'm obsessing over my eye. I'm not even excited for the glasses anymore. Hopefully this is a freak occurrence and not diabetes or something worse. ,Anxiety
35409,Different Muscle Spasm Sensation While trying to go to sleep last night I noticed a different type of muscle twitchspasm in my thigh. I say it's different because any other time I felt a spasm I can see the muscle twitch. It's usually happened in my shoulderupper arm in past. This one is in my thigh but it feels more like a cellphone vibration that's been coming and going intermittently. I'm a fairly active muscular guy who's been focusing on running alot. In the past when I neglect the gym for a few days I've noticed these things happen. I know it's hard to diagnose something like this and I'm most likely overreacting but I've become overly sensitive of new or noticeable indifferences over the years. Thanks for any input!,Anxiety
35410,32 female upper back pain and chest pressure Of course delete if this doesnt belong here. As title suggests I've been experiencing upper back pain between the shoulder blades and chest pressure with palpitations for about 8 days now. Some fatigue but no other symptoms. Went to ER on Friday they did urine and blood samples and a chest xray. All clear. Sent me home with a prescription for Tecta and said it was acid reflux. It very well could be of course but I've struggled with acid reflux a lot in the past and it doesn't feel like this and has never exhibited itself in the form of upper back pain. Taking pain meds doesn't really relieve the pain and it lasts all day and is worse near the eveningsnight. I found taking a hot bath and a massage from my husband can relieve symptoms temporarily 20 mins tops but it always creeps back. I'm 32 female 5'1 102lbs eat relatively well but get little exercise. I am also a long time smoker. Obviously that last point is the most concerning. My GP is generally very dismissive and I don't feel she's going to be much help. Any information at all would be extremely appreciated.,Anxiety
35411,Dark Joke Warning How I beat my health anxiety with one simple trick. I developed depression so not too afraid of dropping dead any moment,Anxiety
35412,Hit my head on car trunk and caused my health anxiety to soar Im a 22 year old male and I hit my head Saturday afternoon on my car tailgate right before I went to go fish with some friends. It was the very top of my head but more towards my left side. Dont really think it caused many problems other than hurting because I was still able to fish and remember when it happened and the events after it happened didnt blackout or whatever. Later Saturday night I felt my head and realized that it actually got cut and its looks kind of like a small raspberrytype injury about the size of a dime maybe smaller.Anyways this caused me to become a huge hypochondriac and elevated my anxiety as I began to think about brain bleeds and what not. My pupils never became dilated and Ive just had a minor headache which could possibly be due to stressanxiety but the pressure is in my face eyes and nose area. The place where I hit is still sore and has the common gooseegg. Ive got a unrelated doctors appointment Friday and wanted to know if yall thought I would be fine until then. I also wanted to ease my mind about brain bleeds and how common they were with an injury like mine? Haha hopefully this doesn't make me sound crazy my anxiety has just been running rampant lately. Thank you in advance everyone,Anxiety
35413,I tried this and it worked Now I don't think it would've worked right when the anxiety started today but by the end of the day I was so sick of the panic nausea warm rushes and racing thoughts while trying to act normal in front of my kids. I just said screw it I'm going to stop fighting it and reasoning with myself why I'm fine and shouldn't be anxious and let it wash over me. It actually worked! I'm so much calmer now I might actually sleep tonight which never happens on bad days. I hope this can help others.

I cant tell my family because they dont know I smoke anymore after getting in trouble 3 years ago and stopping. KARMA right I dont really know what my question is Im just unable to focus on my schoolwork or home life because Im constantly thinking about my body and listening for a warning bell that this is gonna be the pain that sends me to the hospital. Can I detox without going to a doctor and be okay??,Anxiety
35415,TW mention of suicidal behaviour anyone with health anxiety who used to suicidal or still is even? A little long TLDR at end.I dont have many people to talk about health anxiety with as I dont know many people in my real life who deal with it. Or at least who are open about dealing with it.A few years ago I got diagnosed with Somatic Symptom Anxiety after I went to the hospital with chest pain and difficulty breathing but it turned out to be a result of weeks of severe anxiety and stress building up and manifesting in some physical symptoms which at that point I didnt even know could happen. I was paired up with a free psychologist from the hospital who dealt with SSA but unfortunately I really didnt like him and at the time didnt respect my diagnosis either. I felt discouraged that I had went to the hospital with real symptoms and worry my dad has a sudden cardiac arrest in his sleep due to a genetic heart condition they have not found it in me yet but we still keep a close eye on my heart so in a way I didnt feel validated and thought they werent understanding me. It took me over a year to finally accept it and realize that I do get very anxious around the thought of loosing health and death.A few months after all this I started university and was set up with the counsellor there. They turned out to be great and very helpful. Anyway they really helped me dive into myself and get some better understanding of my anxiety. They also helped me realize something which is why Im making this post. I had been suicidal for as long as I can remember. Im currently 27 but when I was about 724 I remember constantly thinking about suicide. I always had a plan. I had attempted it a few times as a teen but wasnt successful. Luckily I was able to get help and turn my life around and start to actually value life. I still had some times where I thought my life is so hard or this is it or my life is getting so disastrous that I should just end it. Now I find myself valuing life enjoying being alive and worrying about deathlosing my health. I used to be so at peace with the thought of dying and saw it as an escape. And now it absolutely terrifies me to the point it affects my day to day life. I sometimes still have suicidal thoughts that cross my mind but Im in a good place in my life and truly believe that I have put it past me for now. Sometimes I worry if something big or tragic happens in my life Ill be back to feeling that way but currently Im good. During the time I was suicidal I never did anything that has caused permanent damage as far as I can tell so far but I definitely wasnt living a healthy lifestyle. Ive struggled with addiction and substance abuse that I have recently gotten a hold on but know it could be too late for some damages the substances can do mostly alcohol but I am trying my best to live healthily and make sure my body has what it needs to recover. I think this fuels my health anxiety too. I will obsess over a symptom and convince myself this is it. Oh youre finally enjoying life? Well too bad its soon over. I know mental health and illness is complicated everyones different they often intertwine and more. But Im curious to know if anyone else has similar thoughts about this or any really.Thank you for taking the time to read and consider this.TLDR Was suicidal as a younger person seems to be gone now but since I am enjoying life and feeling guilt about how I used to life I feel it just fuels and fuels my health anxiety. Wondering if anyone has similar experiences to share?,Anxiety
35416,I can't remember a day when I wasn't worried about dying... Hi allI'm a 26yo male that's been suffering from health anxiety for pretty much ever it seems. I've run the gauntlet of tests doctor visits and scans with my results always coming back negative yet I'm never satisfied. I always have this sneaking suspicion I'm the 0.1 that is sick and doctors cannot diagnose.For the past 2.5 years I've had a swollen lymph node 1cm on the side of my neck and lower on my neck I can feel multiple squishy tinier lymph nodes. I've had ultrasounds many times and even a biopsy for a swollen node in my groin that came back negative for anything strange. Today I found a swelling in my armpit and now I'm in crisis mode once again.Every day with this feels like a battle I must constantly convince myself that I'm healthy when deep down part of me believes I'm not. Every time I think I've made progress it all comes rushing back in like the tide and I'm completely derailed again. I'm so fed up with this and it's clearly no way to live. I never think about the future at all because I can't picture lasting long enough to have a future.I know this is kind of a rambling wall of text I just needed to get this out somewhere because everyone I talk to in my personal life just tells me what to do to feel better. To change my thoughts to eat healthier to be more active yet when these thoughts occur it's like I'm completely overwhelmed and I don't feel like I have a choice.I guess that's it.,Anxiety

35419,How many of you have been triggered by lymph nodes? So I have lived most of my life with anxiety always taking new faces. On december my uncle died of ALS and shit was rough part because he was an amazing uncle and part because that illness is awful. Ever since then I have been suffering health anxiety and just now I am realizing that's what I am feeling. In this time I have been convinced that I have ALS because fuck yeah I do have all the symptoms. I have a tumor on my head my long time sinuses problems are caused by it also as any other new gen kid my sight has develop some wear and my right eye has astigmatism and myopia which is normal. Last but not least I have been touching my lymph nodes for fucking 2 months and they don't go away which my ENT already said was a normal stuff for me. Just now I realized maybe lymph nodes are never that small that if you push hard on your skin they won't be felt it's said a lymph node with a 1 cm diameter is normal. So I have been probably just pushing real hard on my neck that I always find them swollen.,Anxiety
35420,Hard lump in penis and doctor diagnosed as a cyst with no ultrasound or biopsy I discovered a hard lump in the middle of my penis. It seems pretty deepinternal like close to the urethra and not close to the skin. I have no pain and no symptoms except a minor case of vitiligo loss of skin pigmentation on my penis that started developing within the last year. No STDs. I saw my doctor and I feel like he brushed it off too easily. He said it's most likely a cyst showed me a picture of an epidermoid cyst during his explanation and said he just wants to monitor it followup in 6 months and take no further action no ultrasound biopsy etc. My medical record was updated to say it's a cyst.It's the VA and I don't know what their deal is but I guess they try hard to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures. I just don't view it as unnecessary and expected him to order an ultrasound. I pushed back a little said it felt like gambling the doc responded by saying the odds are against anything serious like penile cancer I'm too young 31 and further action is unnecessary. On top of that it's a resident who saw me who had to confer with an attending for guidancefinal approval and the attending never saw me. The resident seemed inclined to order an ultrasound until he spoke to the attending who put the kibosh on that.I acknowledge the odds of cancer are low I just wonder what would happen if they encountered someone who had a genuine case of earlystage penile or urethral cancer. They'd be less likely to catch it at an early stage because they'd wait until it's symptomatic by bleeding or blocking the urethra etc. The potential negative consequences for them are nil and the patient is the one who would be subjected to a penectomy or worse if it turned out they were too complacent. What a nightmare that would be.Does my irritation seem justified or am I making too big a deal of it?,Anxiety

At first it was red and felt just like a bruise when I touched it. Although I was a bit concerned at first because I do not usually bruise with a lump I passed it off as one.

35426,Health Anxiety flareup Hey guys. I'm having a miserable time lately. Just some background I'm a generally healthy 32 year old female. My HA is out of control the last few months. It started in December when I got a possible? eczema patchdry skin on my cheek after a bad cold. I was convinced it was precancerous or the beginning of rosacea. It eventually went away with moisturizing. Didn't stop me from googling the crap out of it and worrying and asking my husband to look at it and reassure me. He of course was thrilled with this Around that time in December I started to eat a big salad everydayjust upped my veggie intake in general to help lose more weight. This made me gassy and gave me loose stools. At the beginning of January I started having some soft thin stools. This has continued off and on. I have mostly normal stools but if I go more than once a day my second is sometimes narrow. This has really scared me and caused a ton of googling and symptom checking. Yesterday I noticed a few small streaks of bright red blood on my normal stool toward the end of it. It happened again today with my first bowel movement. I spent pretty much all day yesterday googling and trying to get a look at what I think is a hemorrhoid. I'm just freaking out. Of course I'm scared I have cancer. I have an appt with a PCP tomorrow morning re the blood which I'm really nervous about. I'm the kind of HA sufferer that hates going to the doctor. I also just found out I'm pregnant again with my third yesterday I'm about 4 weeks. I haven't told my husband yet. I'm of course worrying about whatever horrible GI disease I may have and the impact on this pregnancy.I started therapy for HA about a month ago. My therapist had told me I need to stop googling and reassurance seeking but it's so hard especially with the onset of a scary symptom. Feeling like a failure for googling and symptom checking so much lately. Anyway I just wanted to share with some people who probably get what I'm going through. ,Anxiety
35427,Nightly chest tightness For the last week and a half I have had uncomfortable chest tightness occurring only at night. I feel fine during the day aside from the normal anxiety I have but around 68pm every night I will begin to feel this pressure in my chest almost like someone is sitting on me or I have a tight band strapped around me. I feel the pressure mainly in the center to right side of my chest. Laying on my backside seems to give a little relief. My breathing is ok but it feels like I should be having trouble breathing l if that makes sense?. I am able to go to the gym and lift weights with no issues its not until late in the day the tightness shows up. Has anyone else had a similar issue? Im hoping its only anxiety since it presents with no other symptoms and goes away by the next morning. Thank you!,Anxiety
35428,Waiting for fine needle aspiration results I had a fine needle aspiration on a lymph node on my neck 2 weeks ago I just got a letter through the post about a consultation in a month so waiting 6 weeks in total for results.I rang the hospital and gave my information and they asked the Ent secretary who said they won't give me my results over the phone. I also have severe anxiety so waiting 6 weeks well after 2 I'm already going kind of insane about it I'd rather know if there is something wrong or not and be able to prepare myself instead of being in a state of limbo... Anyone else had to wait until their appointment to find out results? Were they good or bad? Just so I know if there is a chance I'll be fine. I guess this is also venting my frustration of waiting along with asking for advice... ,Anxiety

Every single damn time I end up at a specialist and get a bunch of expensive tests just to find out nothing's wrong. It's all in my head. I have an appointment with an allergist next week to find out what caused a bad reaction... But now all I can think is that the reaction was not real. It was probably just a panic attack.

35433,I hate this stupid disease. My HA first manifested itself when I was a freshman in college. I felt a coldness in my chest on the way home for a weekend probably a flare up of the anxiety I didnt know I had triggered after moving away from home for the first time dealing with college life and new workload homesickness my parents moved from my respective childhood homes first childhood pet died etc. I googled my symptoms and thats where it all went downhill. Heart attack. All of the sudden I was sweating shaking chills feeling of doom lightheaded I truly felt I was going to die. To the point I told my mom not to be sad when I inevitably died.Later that night I had a two hour long panic attack. I begged my boyfriend to drive an hour to where I was to take me to the hospital to which he obliged. I missed my sisters college graduation party sitting in the hospital getting laughed at and joked on by the doctors and nursing staff. Did your boyfriend break up with you recently? Are you on your period honey?.Subsequently that semester I went to the emergency room two other times. One doctor gave me an emergency script for Paxil. Never filled it. Never wanted to. Went to a cardiologist my pediatrician gastroenterologist got an endoscopy etc. I even slept at the foot of my dads bed for a week because I thought He could save me if I died. turns out Im a perfectly healthy 21 year old which is great until I started searching healthy 21 year old surprise heart attack and other similar things. The anxiety subsided after about 8 months. A few months later it resurfaced when I convinced myself I had bed bugs in my apartment. Called the bug people 5 times hired private bug people instead of my apartment ones stayed with my mom for a few weeks begged my best friend to move. No bed bugs. Eventually I healed from that two and recently random itching and a few colds has convinced me I had lymphoma. A headache recently convinced me I had brain cancer or MS. A bruise on the back of my leg has convinced me I have a deep vein thrombosis for the last three weeks. My anxiety has caused me to have a slew of unimaginable PHYSICAL symptomsArm and leg painItchy skinChest painTingling Numbness PanicSweatingShiveringRashesStomach pain Twitching musclesHeadachesHeavy headPins and needlesBack painJoint painSusceptibility to more colds and flusMood swingsfatigue Lack of appetiteIncreased appetiteMissed periodsI hate this terribly debilitating disease. A disease most people will never understand. Convinced my family and friends dont believe me and dont trust me and dont take me seriously convinced the doctors must be missing something convinced Ill be that rare case that dies at 21 from a heart attack. The worst part? Ive been doing well healing. Taking care of myself. It always comes out of no where. Three months of stress no symptoms. A month later it all catches up to me.When will I stop being a slave to health anxiety?

Then it was lung cancer throat cancer breast cancer I am male 21 testicle cancer then again lung cancer again breast cancer. After that it was lung cancer again then once I found out what lymph nodes are I started to search for them and found multiple. Wow. Couldn't get worse.Couple months ago I would press hard on my ribs to feel if something hard that I felt is actually a rib or lymph node. I would spend hours rubbing ribs. It caused so much pain.It's been 3 years since I started to worry about lymph nodes and what gives me a huge relief is a thought if it was something cancerous I would for sure have more symptoms which I dont.I am 21 male gained 16 kilograms in the past 2 years went to gym etc. and I don't think I could do that if I had a terminal illness,Anxiety
35436,Been Working Through Red Herrings With my Therapist and Its Been Helpful for Managing my HA Hi all I wanted to share my recent success with managing my HA. Ive had lifelong depression and have been in therapy for years now. Tried several medications and none have worked for me. Though my main problem is depression every once in a while I switch to anxiety for a few months and thats when the HA kicks in. Im in one of those cycles now.During my last appointment my therapist brought up the concept of Red Herrings. Theyre basically problems that people manifest as a sort of poorly managed coping mechanism for another problem thats harder to process. The most common example of this is an eating disorder. Very often the main problem at the core of a person with an eating disorder isnt their body its the sexual abuse they suffered or their toxic mother or the constant pressure they feel put upon them etc. In a way the red herring can give you something to focus on thats easier to process than the more abstract pain that is often the causes of our mental illness. For me were exploring the possibility that my HA is a red herring.My current homework is to practice mindfulness and pinpoint what I have been thinking about when the hypochondria rears its head and also to let myself experience whatever pain Im feeling. We often try to avoid or push aside negative feelings like sadness and fear by distracting ourselves with a glass of wine or binging a tv show and sometimes you just need that but shes challenged me to try and just let myself experience those negative emotions. Because pain and fear and sadness are parts of life and while theyre uncomfortable theyre also okay. Its OKAY to feel bad sometimes and letting those feelings have their moment can actually help you. So anyway sorry for the rant. Ive been practicing this for a little while now and its been actually helping me. Anxiety still comes and goes but its much better than it has been.Im not a psychologist and Im not claiming this is a cure for everyone or even myself I just wanted to share my recent experience. Maybe someone could get some comfort from it!,Anxiety

35440,My story with HA amp what has helped me! Hello hello! Longtime lurker first time poster. I first came to this sub like most of you looking for other people who have experienced similar symptomsreassurance. When I kept searching around though and reading people's posts about how they overcame their HA that actually ended up helping me more than anything else. I've made a lot of progress in the past few months much of it thanks to advice I've read in this sub! so I thought I'd share some things that help me and a little bit about my story. I first started noticed my anxiety around health in my early 20s. I would take dozens upon dozens of pregnancy tests convinced that they were all wrong and that I was pregnant anyway even though I was on birth control at the time. I'd have headaches and get an MRI. etc. etc. You all know how it goes. I would Google myself into a hole until my anxiety was so bad that I started manifesting other physical symptoms. Then I convinced myself that those physical symptoms were also related to whatever I thought was wrong with me in the first place. It was a vicious endless painful cycle and I could not get myself out of it. It would go away but sure enough when my life was stressful it would happen all over again. A few months ago I had a panic attack in a cab on a way to a work meeting because I thought I was having a stroke and it was so bad that I had to get out of the car. I decided right then and there that I had to fix this thing. So I tried changing some things. I do. not. Google. symptoms. ever. I'm talking EVER. I put a note on my computer to remind me and everything. I do not do it. If I am feeling the urge to do it I distract myself with a podcast or another task I am online all day for my job so if I can do this anyone can. I remind myself that when you Google a symptom you are asking Google's algorithm to show you the worst case scenario. And that is the result you are always going to get. I actually go to my annual doctor's appointments. I used to be so anxious about medical issues that I would avoid checkups altogether. Now when I am having a minor symptom I remind myself that I just went to the doctor and my testsbloodwork were all fine. This helps. If a symptom persists for more than a few days I make an appointment and I go. 99.9 of the time whatever symptom I was wanting to Google disappears within a day. I read this somewhere on here and it really helps. Whenever I'm not feeling anxious or sometimes when I am if I can focus I try to sit completely still and really appreciate all the sensations my body is feeling that I usually ignore. It helps to put my other symptoms in perspective. There are millions of things going on in your body at all times. Obviously sometimes you're going to notice something every now and then. That doesn't mean you're dying. This one is what I struggle with the most but I REALLY try to not scroll through my phone before bed. Putting it on airplane mode and reading a book instead has done literal wonders for my mental health. I hope this helps someone! I still struggle with this often but these tips have really helped me so I hope they help you too. I'm happy to answer any and all questions anyone might have.,Anxiety
35441,19f low heart rate So I have a lot of anxiety about my heart rate. it has always been about it being too high I'm always freaking out over high heart rate. never once did it occur to me that it could be too low because that was never a problem for me. a few weeks ago I was sitting down listening to music with friends. I looked at my fitbit which I constantly check for accuracy and it is usually a max of 3 beats off and my heart rate was 54. I got up and I felt super heavy and drained and had zero energy but I forced myself to walk around and stand up for a while to increase my heart rate. I am diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Disorder. usually when I stand up my heart rate shoots up a fair bit. But I was walking around and standing up and it only went to 56. so I forced myself to skip around. I barely could I felt super heavy and all I wanted to do was submit to gravity and collapse. that made my heart rate go to 57. it took about half an hour to get to an okay place at 72 bpm sitting down.then last night I laid down in bed and my bpm immediately sunk down to 52. I was up for three hours laying in bed bc I couldn't fall asleep over anxiety over my heart rate. I checked it on my fitbit and manually constantly and it was often hovering between 47 and 50. laying in bed typing this now after having stood up for a while it's 59.i am a 19 year old girl 120 lbs. during the summer I'm moderately active but during the winter I am pretty darn sedentary. I booked an appt with my cardiologist but that's for a few days yet. every time I started to fall asleep last night my mind jerked me back convinced I was either passing out or dying. it's gonna be a anxious and sleepless few days. ,Anxiety
35442,Just gotta say today was really tough I recently got hired at a fast food restaurant and today was my third day of training. While my trainer was going over some things I got this pain beneath my shoulder blade that felt really sharp when I breathed in. I started internally panicking worried something was wrong and I was gonna mess up at my new job because I didnt want to leave early or make anyone worry and I didnt want to die in the bathroom etc. I felt a panic attack starting my chest felt heavy and I felt so scared I was convinced something was wrong with my lungs since it was hard to breathe as well. I managed to keep myself from having a panic attack and pushed through my shift even though I got a bad headache for the last hour of it. I got home exhausted. Im still scared that something is wrong with my lungs. Health anxiety is so incredibly exhausting. I hate waking up every day worrying about dying. Its so hard just to work at this minimum wage job. Its just really tiring. I feel like crying.,Anxiety
35443,Lumps and bumps I just need somewhere to let this out. I have a skin disorder called hidradenitis suppurativa HS. Its pretty mild for HS and the last few years its gotten much better. I have also noticed a couple of cysts. On the back of my head my ankle and on the batwing area of my arm. Doctors have looked at the cysts and told me theyre nothing to worry about but I cant stop worrying that its something else or that having these cysts means Im developing others in dangerous spots my brain or lungs. I stupidly looked up diseases that are cooccurring with hs thinking it would make me feel better if I saw that people with HS are just more likely to develop some benign cysts and it mentioned thyroid disorder which I have and lymphoma and heart disease which I am constantly terrified about.Talk me down. Anyone else have stuff like this?,Anxiety
35444,Worried about possible Petechiae So for the past few weeks Ive been having these tiny pinpricksized red or sometimes brown dots appear on my skin. Of course the anxious side of my brain has decided that Im dying of leukemia or some other cancer even though I have no other symptoms that point towards it. Whats especially odd is that these spots appear in certain areas and then go away after a few days. The first time they appeared was on my right hand and arm after I spent the night with my girlfriend. After about two days they went away. Now theres some of these little spots on my right foot and ankle and seemingly nowhere else on my body. Anyone else have something like this occur? Ill probably see my doctor in a few days and see what she thinks but until then that anxious part of me is absolutely certain that Im a dead man walking.,Anxiety
35445,First post and I'm in a bad place. ampx200BIt feels like my esophagus has a lump inside of it. It feels like something is stuck and I am terrified. I have never posted here before and hate to add to the large number of posts here seeking reassurance but I'm really suffering. Esophagus cancer was mentioned on the news last week and it has been on my mind since. Some of the symptoms I have had for a while. ampx200Bregurgitating food chest pains difficulty swallowing and in the last week it now feels like food is stuck down there a lump in my throat feeling as well as further down. ampx200BI've also started to feel like vomiting when I eat which has never happened before due to anxiety. I have however been experiencing intense anxiety the last couple of weeks. ampx200BHealth anxiety is new for me and my question is this ampx200BCan anxiety create symptoms to match the illness you fear? I am convinced my time is up and find it so hard to deal with this right now. ,Anxiety
35446,Fear of Neurological disease because I suck at balancing on one leg with my eyes closed. Ok so I was reading online about the Rombergs test where you stand with your two feet together and fold your arms then close your eyes. You are supposed to be able to do this for at least 20 seconds. I can do this fine.Then the Sharpened Rombergs test. Stand with your heel to the big toe of the opposite foot heel to toe put your hands on your hips and close your eyes. You are supposed to be able to do this for 2131 seconds. Sometimes I can do like 1.5 minutes other times I can only do like 15 seconds. Then the big one. Standing on one leg with your eyes closed for 1530 seconds. Stand on your good foot lift the other foot while bending it has to be at least 6 inches off the ground. I CANT DO IT. I struggle to get to 10 seconds. Sometimes I get 30 but thats after like 4 tries. My legs shake like crazy and I just fall to the side or else my knee gives way. This is scaring me as Im only 22. ,Anxiety
35447,Does anyone have HA about others but not themselves Hey guys I'm 21 years old and have had crippling anxiety and stress about my girlfriend for about the last year or so. I constantly obsess over the idea of us getting married one day and her dying before me leaving me alone. This leads me to incessantly Google risk factors for all sorts of different diseases all the time. I talk to her about it but I feel like she's beginning to be irritated with the constant questions. I've had sleepless nights over the possibility of COPD lung cancer her mother was a heavy smoker throughout her childhood. Dementia she has anxiety and 3 childhood concussions from roughhousing. Diabetes she is overweight. Rheumatoid arthritis complained of knee pain made her go in wasn't ra. Heart conditions her father has high blood pressure I am consumed by this. I have effectively no fear about myself I could care less what happens to me. I really just do not know how to beat this. I'm not even sure if I'm being irrational. Is anyone else in these shoes? Are my concerns justified?,Anxiety
35448,My hypochondria has returned severely after a night of heavy drinking I basically remember having episodes of debilitating hypochondria since I was 16 all the way up to recently. Now I'm 23 and I have had a relatively health anxiety free year. Four nights ago I went out drinking with my friends and we all had a terrible experience blacked out awful hangovers with a whole lot of symptoms and it's brought back my hypochondria full force. Now I'm worrying about stupid things again like whether or not I inhaled too much of the spray cleaner I used because it'll give me lung cancer or how I'm so anxious it'll give me heart problems maybe a clot or a stroke also is the food I eat tainted with some carcinogen am I being poisoned by my environment etc etc it's never ending. I am for the most part physically ok some slight headache and nausea but so much better since that first day post drinking. Yet my mental state is now a mess. I don't know what I'm expecting of this just needed to let it out. I don't want to go through this again. It's taken away so much from me already. ,Anxiety
35449,I keep feeling my heartbeat either skip or flutter and it chokes me everytime. I have had 2 ECG's so far and an echocardiogram about 3 weeks ago and everything was normal. I'm just so confused and lost. I'm scared they missed something. Does anyone else experience this weird symptom? I don't know how to explain it. My heart just randomly skips a bit or flutters and then it races afterwards. It chokes me when it happens. ,Anxiety
35450,Convinced I have MS Hey. I can't seem to calm myself down right now... I've completely convinced myself I have MS.. my HA has been seriously terrible lately. I keep having panic attacks and I have embarrassingly broken down several times this past week at work. This post is long I'm very sorry.I'm a 21 yo female. I've had health anxiety for nearly all my life. For the past few months I've had pain through my left buttock and leg. Went to Dr who said it was pinched sciatic nerve which completely makes sense my dad has also had the same problem and it sounds exactly like what I have anyway I still obsessed over it being a blood clot or something serious. Sometimes when I am very stressed my arms tend to go weak and I shake. I also will feel numb in certain areas of my body. Recently though the area around the left side of my mouth has felt weaknumb when I'm anxious. I always check in the mirror and it's not drooping or anything. It makes my anxiety go through the roof. I also am very aware of my speaking when this happens and I sometimes feel as if I slur my words. It never lasts very long and usually if I take anxiety medication it goes away fairly quick. However when googling this I know I can't keep googling things like the first result is MS.. I can't shake it... Here are my other symptoms...very tired. I did just start on two anxiety medications so I'm trying to attribute my tiredness to that.I'm constantly tense. My jaw is nearly always tight and my shoulders are always up to my ears.tight chestfeels like I'm short of breath frequently. I think I'm like.. slightly hyperventilating at all times.frequent nausea. blurry vision especially at night or after looking at my phone for a long time having it now unfortunatelyfeeling disconnecteddizzy when I'm extremely anxiousi get very itchy on my thighs and on my arms. This has happened all my life. Usually if I'm wearing warm clothes under a blanket or I've just taken a hot shower I've always had this and assumed dry skin but I learned that sometimes MS can cause hot itchiness that is often mirrored on the body even worse I noticed yesterday that in the places I've scratched really hard I've even left small bruises and a few scratches.for as long as I can remember I've had this thing where if I'm laughing really hard I lose my grip can't hold a pencil or something idk it's weirdwhen I'm anxious sometimes when I'm not my hands shakeive always been pretty strong but for as long as I can remember my arms shake like if I'm pouring a pitcher of water or something.i have also had excema on my hands for the last few years Dr said due to stress and excessive hand washing which lines up but it did start out mirroredI watched a video yesterday of a man who had been hardcore dealing with MS fears who went to the doctor and he was fine and all. He listed a few of his symptoms a lot of which I shared. He also mentioned very weak muscles and twitching along with pins and needles in his limbs. I was thankful I hadn't really had any of that. But seriously just a few hours later all these symptoms hit. Even worse today. My hands have been jittery the whole time I've typed this.. I know there are more symptoms. I'm sorry this post is a mess. I'm seriously so scared. Lately all I can think about is my health. I'm finding it hard to do basic tasks and function normally. I'm sorry that this was so long. I just wondered if anyone else deals with this.,Anxiety
35451,Dont know whats wrong with me I really can't believe all of this is just anxiety. I did get told I had pots at the hospital.

35453,I wish I could just be normal Like it'd be super cool if I could just experience a minor stomach flu without being consumed by fear that it's actually something much worse. Normal people don't go to the emergency room because they threw up twice and have a low grade fever. They put a trash can next to the bed and go to sleep. ,Anxiety
35454,Afraid of sleeping Kept waking up this morning with sleep paralysis and felt like I was dying. Ive had a headache for 4 days and Im convinced Im going to have an aneurysm in my sleep because I feel like Im passing out every time I go to close my eyes and sleep. And If i do fall asleep and wake up I know Ill have hallucinations becaue Im so anxious. I keep telling myself its anxiety but Im not believing it. Not sleeping is just making everything worse and I feel hopeless. ,Anxiety
35455,Twitching ive always had random twitches since i developed health anxiety and ive been able to dismiss it always especially being that its been 6 years. although if i dismissed then and lowered my anxiety why did they remain? and on thursday i just started having them consistently in my legs. thursday i was in a bad mood but not that anxious? anyway its either that or random stinging pain. pain but doesnt really hurt at all. ive been to the gym ran whatever all good but im still concerned about circulation issues or whatever googling it all lol.,Anxiety
35456,Freaking Out and Anxious Please send good vibes I just turned 18 and so far this year has sucked. During my two month break from university I got heart palpitations for the first time in my life. That led to a google fest for me. I thought it was over the next day and was ready to just move on when I got really bad stomach aches and chest pain. I went to the ER and they said I was fine. I decided to take a break from school to talk with my GP and he said I just had anxiety. Its been 2 months since then and while the stomach problems have mostly dissipated I have started to notice random twitching all over my body along with headaches and some numbness in my middle finger. Today my left arm feels weak and sore. I am going to see my GP in a week but I am anxious. I feel like the boy who cried wolf at this point while I feel like something is wrong sometimes I feel unable to explain it properly. I'm trying not to actively thinking about these symptoms because I know anxiety has many effects but it I just can't rationalize that these symptoms are normal. I'm just holding on to the fact that there have been too many random symptoms within such a short amount of time for it too be some terrible illness.,Anxiety
35457,Irrational fear of rabies So I know that my fear is irrational but I cant stop thinking about it! At the beginning of January I mean very beginning like 4th I was at a store where the owner had two cats. The cat that bit was very friendly at first was rubbing against my mom and I. My mom had playfully ruffled its head and it had swatted at her I then went to pet it and it bit me! Looking back it the incident I know the cat was most likely just annoyed hence why it bit me. At the end of January I mistakenly decided to consult dr google about rabies. This seemed to set something off in my brain that night I couldnt sleep. I was terrified that I was going to die of rabies. I went to the doctors and received a tetanus shot and was told to call the owner. My mom called for me and the owner told her that since the cats are in a public place they have to be up to date on their shots. While this was reassuring at first a day later I kept having what if thoughts. Such as what if the lady was lying about about the cat being vaccinatedEither way its now March and Im experiencing what I think is anxiety. Every time I think about my health my chest tightens up and it feels like I cant breath. Im having awful muscle twitches in my legs arms and eyelids. Im also having what I think is pains in my left arm not the arm I was bit by the cat. And the newest thing is Im getting horrible nausea to the point where I feel close to throwing up and I havent thrown up in years. Even now I cant help but wonder what if Im just having a long term incubation periodI guess Im here looking for some reassurance that Im not going crazy or dying slowly of rabies,Anxiety
35458,Worried about stomach cancer Hi! 19 F here. For the past 6 months I get very nauseous very easily especially after eating or when stressed. Since around November Ive started puking regularly. Ill puke once a day for maybe a week then be fine for a week. During bad episodes I puke anywhere from 37 times a day. Ive been gaining weight since this happened. Havent vomited any blood red color is from foods I have eaten. Diarrhea usually precedes the vomiting and has a certain smell smell only occurs in diarrhea RIGHT before I puke. Immediately after puking the nausea goes away until the next episode. Symptoms worsen before exams presentations stressful events. Ulcer has been ruled out. My brain is going straight to the assumption I could have cancer and I am terrified ,Anxiety
35459,Stomach issues I currently have some stomach issues that's making my HA flare up.ampx200BIt started 3 weeks ago when i felt nauseus after eating lunch i then focused on this and started googling bad idea Then i started feeling bloated after eating and i was having early satiety belchingburping and nausea. I had good and bad days but was mostly afraid of stomach cancer... however after reading cancer statistics only one person between 30 and 35 got stomach cancer last year here in Norway I no longer have this concern. But the problems are still here. I went to the doctor on friday he said it was reflux because of a weak muscle in my stomach and put me on Nexium 20mg for 4 weeks so that my esophagus would heal.. I took this medication for two days and have stopped because of bad side effects i got very bad nausea and diarrhea and stomach pain ampx200BI still have the following symptoms Bloating and gas in stomach after eating nausea and no appetite. I have lost some weight but i have not eaten as much as i usually do. Is this Anxiety playing its tricks on me? Has anyone had similar experiences? ,Anxiety
35460,Fuck lymph nodes I spent about two months completely paranoid about lymph nodes under my jaw before I discovered they were actually just part of the muscles in my neck. And now I've just discovered that a lymph node on the side of my neck is swollen despite feeling no symptoms at all and I'm freaking out all over again. You look on the internet and it's all HIV cancer etc. I also live in a country where I can't speak the language and need someone with ID to help me go to the hospital but I feel terrible about constantly asking my girlfriend to go when I don't even really feel physically ill just to discover it's apparently nothing.

35462,Red bump on perinium between scrotum and anus. NSFW I've had this sole red bump on my perineum between anus and scrotum for at least a year or two now. It is less than half a centimeter wide.

I have had like a nagging pain there that comes and goes randomly most of the week and dont know why. Of course the first thought is heart related because 20 year olds have so many heart attacks. The logical part of my brain tells me its indigestion or Im just backed up or something. But the terrible part of the brain says a heart attack is imminent. Just wondering if anyone has had similar experience and or have any tricks to prove to themselves that whatever it is your feeling is not a heart attack but more likely nothing serious at all. ,Anxiety
35464,I need help vertigo I dont know what to do. Ever since the end of January this year I have been feeling totally off balance and at times dizzy like Im going to throw up. It feels as though Im on a boat thats rocking and that the floor is uneven. Its especially worse when I sit down or am lying down as it feels like someone is rocking me back and forth. Ive been to the hospital where they said I had vertigo but gave me medication that didnt help. Ive been to the doctor who looked at me eyes and everything and said it was vertigo. I went to a naturopath who said he wasnt sure what it was but it could be an effect of the 20 mg of cirpalex that Im taking. Im seeing a physical therapist who doesnt think the vertigo is coming from my ear canal but rather stress and neck tension. The rocking has been so bad recently and it hasnt stopped at all. I want to get an MRI and I genuinely believe I have a brain tumor. Please help Im terrified and dont know what to do ,Anxiety
35465,Just a share I've been browsing here quietly for a good while and wanted to post just to share my HA experiences.I'm 29 turning 30 at the end of the month and have suffered from Health Anxiety for about 5 years now. My mom died from alcoholism when I was 16 so I think that is probably my gateway. In the last 5 years I've had C. Diff from antibiotics been diagnosed as hypothyroid severely high untreated TSH after a pregnancy really caused some complications had emergency surgery after gallstone induced pancreatitis though I had pancreatitis and liver blockages multiple times throughout a year and a half and during a pregnancy which weren't ever caught because I lived so close and got to the ER too soon for anything to reflect in my lipase and liver tests and now have tachycardia that may be P.O.T.S but am in the process of cardiologist appointments to nail down the issue. I'm also possibly bipolar after having been prescribed Paxil and it putting me into mania though I stopped seeing my psychiatrist before he made a definitive diagnosis. Scared of getting the diagnosis and then everything I experience from here on out being blamed on bipolar like doctors do now with my thyroid.My HA is ruining my life. I spend hours Googling because I feel like I can't trust doctors after so many runins with them where they said pancreatitis was gastritis and sent me on my way assuming I was some kind of drugseeker. Because of my Paxil experiences I'm afraid to try any kind additional head med. I'm a mess essentially like many here.Currently obsessing over the fact I've never had my cholesterol checked and every time I eat or drink anything other than water I get fatigued to such a point that it feels like I'm drugged. Husband is diabetic so I've been able to check my sugar levels and there's nothing unordinary there. I check my blood pressure regularly as well. The overwhelming sedatinglike fatigue also comes with even minimal activity which has also had me freaked out about heart failure. All my ekgs have been fine though I'm not even sure that rules out heart failure. I've had iron tests hormone tests though I still suspect hormones to be the underlying culprit am taking vitamin d for a deficiency thyroid hormone and T4 is in range... everything is normal. I was vegan for 6 months quit smoking several years ago and very rarely drink. I tested positive twice for ANA and one of the SSA or SSB tests for Sjogren's Autoimmune but my doctor still insists I don't have it though another doctor at my clinic says I do because that's all you need... not sure how that works. Anyway Sjogren's may also be a culprit in my potential reasons you're dying book.Does anyone here have suggestions as to what helps them overcome their hypervigilance and keep themselves distracted from terrorizing themselves? I am in desperate need.Also if you have any mental illnesses that your HA piggyback's on I'd like to hear your experience too.,Anxiety

35471,Feta cheese with bonus mould Ok so My mom gave me an entire brined brick of feta cheese because no one else in the family likes feta i guess. I've had it about two weeks now? Anyways I opened it tonight and there was some small amount of mould on the rim and also a little tiny bit on an exposed bit I avoided. I just took some from what was still in the brine. So I nibbled on some with some crackers but now I'm kinda worried? I googled it but nothing actually specified my specific case. The closest case I could find had a lot more mould involved. Is this okay to eat? If not are the crackers leaning against it ok? I paid 2.47 for these crackers and I have like a third of the box on this plate. I kinda need to know now because currently my plate is just sitting here in the open and I can't have that going on for too long. Also is the little bit I ate ok? I'm going out for breakfast tomorrow and I don't want to be sick. If crackers are still ok what goes well with breton vegetable crackers?,Anxiety

The worst part is my left side of my mouth is pins and needles ans sometimes my left corner of my left eye feels stroke like. No change no droop and it's just a feeling if I pinch it I can feel it. The worst part of this is it had thrown me into DPDR which has been not so great when I am a Dad to three kids and my wife. When I am in DPDR and feeling like I do my libido is shot and it's hard to feel love when you question every feeling. I am just venting.

35477,is it at all possible I'm gonna get rabies? It's been almost two days since this happened so if I did contract rabies it's probably too late. I was driving home and saw a cat lying in the street so I got out of the car to check if it was alive. there was blood coming out of its mouth so I'm assuming it had internal injuries from getting hit by the car. I touched its backshoulder area to see if it was alive but it was cold to the touch. anyway I put hand sanitizer on when I got back to my car but I know hand sanitizer can't really kill viruses and after I put the sanitizer on I noticed I had a papercut on my finger that I didn't see before. on the hand I touched the dead cat with! is it possible there was rabies virus on the cat's fur like maybe invisible blood that I couldn't see?? ,Anxiety

35479,Brain Tumor Concerns Ive been feeling super anxious lately and thought it would be worth venting out at the moment. Im M20 years old and Ive been feeling anxious over the idea of a brain tumor. Headaches have been presentish but theyve been minor. I wouldnt call them the worst headaches in my life. I feel like Ive been seeing tiny streaks of light? Its not huge glares or anything that has messed up my vision but I feel like I see tiny streaks sometimes. I sometimes feel like I have double vision when reading? But that might be just a me problem since I need glasses. Left eyelid has a small twitch. Though the right eyelid has been starting a bit too. Been waking up earlier than normal. Not sure if my speech always had me stuttering. Might be overthinking it. My ears have been ringing for a while now. I havent vomited or suffered any seizures yet.I dunno if I can chalk this up to allergies since they hit hard this season. I just need comfort that this isnt a reason to panic. This anxiety has been really messing me up and even if Im going to the doctor in two weeks Im a bit concerned for my health.,Anxiety

35483,Vision oddities Hey all just wanted to ask if anyone had any similar experiences to myself. A few months ago I 25 had my first panic attack that sent me to the ER. EKG came out perfect sent me home. Soon after I started getting more and more panic and anxiety symptoms at an increasing rate. Started diagnosing myself foolishly with all kinds of different things from heart problems a ministroke MS brain tumor the works. Went from 0 to hypochondriac in weeks. Went to my doctor and got some tests for thyroid and such all fine. My BP is slightly high at 13582 as well.Most of the symptoms of everything has gone away except my vision. I woke up one morning about 67 days ago with.. not what I would call blurry vision but almost an otherworldly filter applied to it. Nothing is any more difficult to read no flashing no pain no color changes but things are just hard to look at and I've got a bit of tunnel vision going on. I've always had floaters in my vision and there aren't any new ones but the floaters themselves are kinda blurry now and I notice them everywhere instead of just outside.Could it just be eye strain from being in a constant state of stress for a month straight with poor sleep quality? I'm not asking for a diagnosis obviously but I want to know if this is a shared experience from anyone else.,Anxiety
35485,Weird chain of health anxiety 19 Male 56 97 ibs So 3 weeks ago I had a respiratory virus and after I got better a week later I havent felt the same since. My brain was felt so foggy and I couldnt remember most of the things that were going on because I was so zoned out and it made me think I had dementia or something so my mind was set on that I got real anxious and scared that I had dementia. Then a week goes by my right hand and foot start having a burning sensation and of course look up online on what causes that and now I think I have diabetes or that I have nerve damage from exercising. its been like this for 4 days and I still have the burning sensations but they come and go and Im anxious about it.,Anxiety
35486,Positive thinking for others whose HA is cancer based the what ifs So my health anxiety is almost entirely grounded in cancer. Today Im worried about lymphoma and brain cancer. A month ago it was lung and digestive cancers. Before that leukemia and before that bone cancer. You get the gist. My dad was diagnosed with cancer and did pass away from it. Before you freak out he was older active but poor poor diet his whole life. History of alcoholism. I mention this because its good context for my issues. My health anxiety spirals every year around this time JanMar when he was sick. Even though I know many many statistics about age of diagnosis and general health and this and that it doesnt always stop the worrying as many of you are well aware. I tend to catastrophise. If I feel bad it must be cancer and since its cancer Ill die a painful death in a couple months. I typically avoid cancer stories as they trigger me up pretty badly duh but today I stumbled across a story of a 27 year old guy who was diagnosed with a rare brain cancer a few months ago. Today he announced he was cancerfree. The world isnt perfect and it isnt always fair. There are lots of what ifs. But I think its so so so important to remember the what ifs are conjecture and NOT fact. So you go through the thing your lymph nodes are swollen. Youre probably a little sick with a cold or maybe youve been poking your neck non stop for weeks to check. So you probably dont have lymphoma. Okay but what if you do? Honestly youd probably be fine. This is not ALWAYS the case. But if we go by percentages 99 of your worries are not cancer or malignant or serious at all. 75 of that 1 of real and serious conditions respond well to treatment. Theres variance but this is a great time in history to have cancer. Treatments are so plentiful and effective. Maybe you DO have brain cancer but so? That 27 year old kid did. Hes alive and well. To be abundantly clear I think its most important to challenge false conclusions first and foremost. Challenge your worries. If youre in a rut though and you just cant shake the feeling that THIS TIME is has to be cancer I just know it has to be stay optimistic! We are a community of worriers. Challenge yourself to think of best case scenarios even if theyre within the worst case. Im here with you if youre scared of something today. And Im so positive that we will get through it just fine I want you to be positive of that as well ,Anxiety
35487,I've been worrying about aneurysms since last night and its been a really rough time. How do I get past this? Hey everyone I'm so glad that subreddit exists because it's so comforting to know that I'm not the only one who struggles with this type of anxiety since I was a little girl.Recently though I have been really sick like since before Thanksgiving. I've had bronchitis the Norovirus ended up in hospital tonsillitis the flu then the stomach flu again and now I'm at home sick for a week because the cold I've had since early November never went away and it has turned into walking pneumonia and strep throat. My throat is covered in huge white blisters and it's just so disgusting.But anyways I was put on a really high antibiotic and Prednisone 3x a day and it's just made me feel anxious and so strange. I started feeling like my pulse in my groin and it really freaked me out so I Googled I want to punch myself lol and the first thing that came up was aneurysm. Then my husband told me it was probably the steroid making my nerves jittery so I googled again I rly need to stop and it said that some people have experienced something called phantom vibrations or something like that. The thing is though I'm pretty sure this has happened to me before and I've never paid it any attention.I had a rly bad panic attack right after that but I took a shower and calmed down and was fine. But today my hip and leg have been aching and I'm not sure if it's my fibromyalgia acting up bc I'm sick or if it's just a psychosomatic symptom or even possibly the Prednisone making me feel this way.Has anyone else ever experienced this? Because I know it's probably nothing but I've just had a rough time today with being worried about it And having the thought of aneurysm in the back of my brain.Bless you if you made it to the end of this post.,Anxiety
35488,Final exams coming up. Host of issues... Hey everyone Im in the middle of a panic attack right now and this is my best option as its the middle of the night and I cant talk to anyone right now.I have final exams next week and Ive been very stressed out lately and although most people tend to overeat when theyre stressed I am the type of person who feels nauseous and does not like the thought of food during stress. Anyways this past week or so I was sick with a sore throat and developed a sore neck that still keeps reappearing. On top of that today my left leg started hurting in a specific spot and Im pretty sure something happened to my muscle. My anxiety has been elevated because after a night out over the weekend my friend took pictures and although all our eyes had a white reflection from the flash one of my eyes was especially white in multiple pictures. I have read about concerning disorders that can be a cause to the white flash so I immediately went into panic mode. I have been experiencing problems with this eye and suspicions of glaucoma by one doctor and overall my eye has been especially red lately. I cant help but think something is seriously wrong but I keep reassuring myself that its probably just because Im a heavy contact lens wearer and my eyes need some oxygen and relaxation. I made an appointment with my eye doc to make sure. In the meantime Im trying my best to calm down and forget everything so I can study and not jeopardize my future. ,Anxiety

35492,Food related triggers anyone? Just wondering does anybody else get food related triggers? I'm currently going through a stage where I'm super worried about developing diabeties.

35493,Eating Beets Red Stool I had a fairly large amount of cut up beets for lunch today around noon along with a small cup of beet lemonade. Around 5pm my stool had quite a reddark pink tint to it and the toilet water was that color as well. It is now 830 and I have gone again same result. I am aware that beets can discolor your stool however 5 hours seems pretty fast. I thought it normally takes food upward of 24 hours to go from being consumed to being excreted. Am I worried for nothing? This has never happened before and I have eaten beets before but never quite as much as I did today. Thanks in advance.,Anxiety
35494,Worried I have ovarian cancer. The more I'm on social media the more I hear about 'silent killer' cancers. I read that a common symptom of ovarian cancer is being bloated and feeling full quickly. I feel full a lot and never really finish my plate and I often have a bloated stomach. I pee pretty frequently too. I just feel so stupid going to a doctor with these sort of symptoms. I also have a fear that a doctor will wrongly say that I'm fine and then I'll be all relax while the cancer spreads inside me. There's so many different types of illnesses to consider and be at risk of. It drives me insane. ,Anxiety
35495,Im convinced I have a urethral stricture In may of last year I had a type of explosion in my bladder. It came with an insane feeling of urgency frequency and a feeling that myBladder was in the grip of a vice. I also had an electrical type feeling in my bladder and Perineum.I saw a urologist who thought I had a urethral stricture. I was sent for a cystoscopy that showed everything was ok. That was in September 2018. 3 months later the urgency and frequency decreased but then what accompanied was pelvic pain tailbone pain I had to start sitting down to urinate and I had to start milking my urethra to empty it at this time I was also tapering from 6mgs of clonazepam. I hit 2mgs when this started. I finished my taper on clonazepam in the middle of February.I now have all of those symptoms but theyre at full force now. For the past two weeks I had a slight burn at the end of urination. Peeing didnt hurt but at the end I had a sharpburn pain in a specific area in the top of my penisurethra. For the past two weeks Ive had a feeling that theres a marble stuck in my urethra. Sometimes I can feel pressure in my urethra when I move about. Sometimes I get a sharp stabbing pain down my urethra too. The side of my penis hurts too. IAlso have to gently milk my urethra to get the rest of the urine out. My fear is that the cystoscopy has caused a stricture. Its done the very thing that it was supposed to rule out. There was no blood after it was done nor did it burn when I peed but the tip of my penis was very swollen for anHour or so. Apparently its extremely rare for someone to get a stricture from a routine cystoscopy especially in the area I think mine is. But Im 100 convinced that I have one. Its making me very ill. I see the urologist in 5 days time. Im in a chronic pelvic pain support group and apparently this is a very common symptom. But other guys have the same symptoms and have a stricture. I dont want another cystoscopy but Im guessing Ill have to have one as its the only way to treat a stricture. I cant believe Im in this mess. Im so upset and frustrated. ,Anxiety
35496,Vision AnxietyConfusion Is it normal to not be able to focus on anything within about a foot from your eyes? Like it's basically double vision up until a foot. Then it seems like for a few feet out I have to make a conscious effort for things to remain focused. Or it's kind of like if I zone out things within a few feet will go out of focus or be doubled. Everything beyond a few feet stays focused however.Basically is it normal to easily see double vision one foot out and somewhat easily see it a 23 feet out?,Anxiety
35497,Absolutely terrified and think I have cancer. I know I shouldn't be posting this but I have gotten myself into such a state. I can't stop crying and hyperventilating I feel sick I can't sleep the list is endless. In February I got a letter from my doctor telling me my urine sample contained a small amount of blood which was not due to infection and I would need to be investigated. Said urine sample was taken about 3 or 4 days after my period ended. I still haven't gone back to the doctor out of fear of being told I have something serious.However on Tuesday 12th March I went to the toilet and noticed a significant amount of blood in my pee and I was extremely frightened. My period is due this week however it still hasn't arrived for some odd reason. I'm definitely not pregnant and surely blood in my urine isn't normal. I was hoping this was just spotting due to hormones but I doubt I am that lucky. I'm shaking as I type this. What if it's kidney bladder ovarian or any other cancer? Isn't this the warning sign? I really don't want to die I've finally found happiness and I'm doing well in life it's just NOT FAIR!!!ampx200BPlease tell me blood in urine doesn't always mean cancer???,Anxiety
35498,Substitute for food when there is no appetite? I was diagnosed with a kidney infection on Tuesday 3 days ago after having a UTI from the following Monday to Friday. Saturday was when it started getting uncomfortable. I took my mum to eat at a lovely Indian restaurant to which we ordered to our hearts content then I only took a few bites and was full! We then proceeded to go and see a show at the theatre and to be completely honest I couldnt wait for it to end I was fidgety all the way through! Monday was chills and fevers and an ice pick head ache just about a mm above my right ear which I still have Tuesday I got a drs appt to which I got told off for not eating as I had a dangerous amount of ketones in my urine. She also told me to eat...but never specified what when I told her that I physically couldnt hold down food. Now this is day 7 and Im prepared to drink full fat milk for my antibiotics there is no soup in the house Ive lived off of cranberry juice for the last 5 days. I have a chocolate protein shake thing that takes water. Any suggestions is a great help at this point. ,Anxiety

Ive been to 3 cardiologists and been to the er at least 20 times and had ekgs every time. Had a stress test and an echo and it all came back negative. I cant stop convincing myself that something has happened since then and Id go back to the er but Im afraid of being admitted again. Im a 20 year old male and have my whole life ahead of me but Im to paralyzed by fear to live it. I know Im having a heart attack every time it happens and its hard to even imagine it getting better and being happy.

Hi.My very first post here but been reading it for a long time and have a quick question.Lately Ive been dealing with a lot of your common symptoms such as headache nausea stomachache shortness of breath heart palpitations numbness random quick pains all over etc..But yesterday night I was laying in my bed and suddenly completely out of blue my left shoulder started to hurt. And it is very painful when touched. I can move my arm completely and its not painful. But when pressed or even just touched gently it hurts. I havent injured it anywhere as I usually spend my days on my laptop working while layind down. And of course I started googling constantly think about the pain and touch it every 5mins to make sure if the pain is still there. And now it feels like my arm is not painful but has a weird sensation.Also read somewhere that anxiety can cause these random bone muscle or joint pains all over the body. So was wondering if anyone else had this kind of pain or am I going insane?Thank you and have a lovely day!,Anxiety
35501,A small victory I don't post very often and never before on this sub but I wanted to share a small victory. As you can imagine I spend a lot of money on doctor visits and tests that turn out to be just fine. I have spent too darn much and so I've challenged myself to just wait things out no matter what. My first challenge arrived quickly. On Tuesday I got a rash very likely from sweatingrubbing because I noticed it right after the gym and it was around my neck and chest where my shirt collar rests. It was red itchy and painful. I DID NOT Google. I started to but I stopped. I put some hydrocortisone cream on it and ignored it. Ever so briefly thought about going to urgent care autoimmune? My joints hurt... is it infected? Etc. It's almost gone today. Four days. Granted the source of the rash was clear. And I'm still worried about the size of the lymph nodes in my neck. And random belly pains make me think of tumors.... but this one thing..... I waited out this rash and it was fine. It gives me strength to ignore the next thing.,Anxiety

35504,Last month filled with illness and anxiety not being able to sleep well and surgery possibly coming up. Need advice on how to cope. I've had really bad panic attacks and anxiety since I was around 14 up till the age of 16. After my first major panic attack I was hospitalized for a week after which they concluded it was anxiety and referred me to a psychiatrist. ampx200BI've essentially been free of panic attacks since but have had periods of anxiety centered around my health. ampx200BThe last month has been especially terrible. It started with an eye infection that caused an eye edema where my left eyeball developed a dent and a bump. The ambulance ride was nervewracking and I was given antibiotics at the ER and then discharged.ampx200BThen I got stomach flu. Terrible week. I felt weak dehydrated and completely sapped of all energy. More antibiotics I felt better after a few days. This is when I started to become hyperaware of my heartbeat. ampx200BThen I got sick again for 23 days fever cold sore throat. Had some relief but then went out on the weekend walked home in skimpy clothes in freezing cold and rain bronchitis for another week. ampx200BLast week I started getting wisdom tooth pain. It's an infection and abscess. Dentist said I need to have it pulled. Terrified of the surgery and especially the anesthesia. Haven't had it before scared of an allergic reaction or complications. Dental anesthesia can briefly cause palpitations which sucks because I'm so worried over the health of my heart. ampx200BAround 4 weeks of constant healthrelated drama worrying palpitations panic. The worst is probably the poor sleep. I cant fall asleep easily because I keep checking my heart rate and freak out when it slows down. My resting heart rate is around 60 so I really freak out when there's a long time between beats.

35505,How to go about requesting a heart check up? Hi everyone I guess Ive always been a little bit of a hypochondriac but serious health anxiety is a new thing for me. I was required recently to take a 9 hour long first aid certification class for a new job in which we discussed heart attacks and cardiac arrest for hours on end. Following that Ive been seeing deaths of young people around my age such a Lotte Van Der 19 and Felicite Tomlinson 18. I am 21 and now Im in constant fear of an underlying heart issue that I am unaware of. I would like to get whatever tests are necessary to easy up some of my anxiety because I know that I have never had any tests done regarding my heart. So my question is how do I go about this? What do I request? My mom suggested I say that there is a history of heart attacks in my family but Im not sure if thats necessary. At 21 am I going to receive a lot of push back regarding the necessity of these tests or is it pretty straight forward to get? Any advice would be great thank you so much. ,Anxiety

It happens and then I realize I'm anxious which makes it worse. Has anyone learned how to help themselves when something like this happens? I have just started seeing a counselor who is booked at least a month out ,Anxiety
35515,My worry at the moment I vaped for two years and recently quit two weeks ago because I noticed my laugh has a weird noise now with it so now I have weird sensations in my throat always want to clear it always having a feeling of needing to cough and I read that could be a sign of throat cancer so its all on my mind.,Anxiety
35516,Fear of being sick I suffer from health anxiety mostly related to MS and brain tumours I had an episode of vertigo which has triggered that and in the past I've had HA about heart related illnesses. I've seen a lot of posts worrying about those things but I also suffer from a real fear of throwing up. I'm paranoid about food poisoning and it's ruined my enjoyment of a lot of foods. I overcook a lot of my food and throw a lot of stuff out. Right now I'm sat here worrying that the chicken I had earlier from a take out wasn't cooked properly. I feel sick but that could just be a symptom of being anxiety. Does anyone else have HA around vomiting and food poisoning? ,Anxiety
35517,Mumps exposure I have been in a room with someone that have mumps 1 day after the onset of symptoms salivary swelling symptom. We had no close contact whatsoever but we did share the space. Was in the room for about 15 minutes in total.ampx200BCant remember if I had it in my youth parents can't recall either and I most likely haven't been vaccinated for it it wasn't of the immunization programs at the time.

35519,I think meet all the requirements for colon cancer.... Ive noticed bright blood in my BMs for a few years but my GI doctor said it was hemmorhoids. Its usually blood that I see on the surface but sometimes its kind of faded. I drink enough water and eat plenty of fiber but I still find that I strain when I have a bowel movement even when I use a squatty potty at home. I thought it was hemmorhoids that just wouldnt go away but now Im getting more concerned. Im going to the GI tuesday to assess but Im still very scared.Im 25 years old with no known history of colon cancer on any side of my family. I know my risk is low but Ive had this for at LEAST five years and theres a chance I may have let it go on for too long. ,Anxiety
35520,Constant Headaches. Ive been under a lot of stressbeen having lots of anxiety lately.Ive been having headaches all around my head pain ranging from mildmoderate.Sometimes its in the side of my head sort of like pressure? I cant explain it. Also I have wisdom teeth coming in and sometimes it goes up to my head. Right now its on the left side. Very very mild. Should I be worried about aneurysmsbrain tumours?,Anxiety
35521,UTI...or not So I woke up on Friday having very mild symptoms of a uti just a tiny bit of burning after peeing. I immediately drank a ton of water to flush. Afterwards the burning was barely noticeable but I know it was still there. Saturday morning I wake up and its still barely noticeable but still there so I make a doctors appointment. Unfortunately my regular doctor isnt in that day and neither is my usual back up so I book with the only doctor thats in. At this clinic for as long as I could remember Ive gone here for over 10 years they usually give you the results of the urine sample before you leave keep this in mind that was the only reason I went because I convinced myself the only thing this could be is a uti or perhaps something worse even though I know I dont have any of the symptoms but you never no right? Its better to be safe. Anyways she comes in and I explain my problem. At first she mentions it could just be irritation and she mentions something in particular that I do to dry my nether regions and I thought wow I could of actually cut myself or overwashed and a wave of relief washed over me. Because I do tend to overwash and use scented products. But then she said she would prescribe me a medication if I have a uti. She left and the nurse came in a few minutes later. The whole thing took 5 mins. The nurse comes back in saying I wont have the result for three days and Im confused so I call in the doctor. And she said theres no harm in taking it even if you dont have it. This goes against what my usual doctor says she never suggests taking anything unnecessarily. Especially when it comes to a urine culture. Because of resistant bacteria or something. Anyways i left and picked up the medicine but it occurred to me she didnt ask many questions...so that left me thinking it could be something else. Like a cut or a yeast infection or just being incredibly over washed. She didnt even ask if I was sexually active or not or if I was having any other symptoms or if my period is due. But I was also in shock by how impersonal that visit felt as its not what Im used to. So I have the medication but you know me being anxious I dont want to take it unless I have the results of the culture. At some moments it feels like Im just irritated down there given what happened during the week leading up to these events. I quit using the regular soap I was using down there but I stilll used it for the rest of my body and if some slips down there it does burn. But sometimes I think omg did I just had a tiny muscle pain in my back is it an infection. Or regular body sensations freak me out. Im really trying to relax but my mind keeps racing to all sorts of things ,Anxiety

My life is kind of miserable as a result. In the quiet moments during a conversation I can almost guarantee you thats what Im thinking about.

35525,First time health anxiety. Around late October I noticed whenever I smoked weed it was hard to swallow. Normal people get hungry and eat. I didn't eat I had anxiety until I felt normal again. I guess the dry mouth you get made it worse for me to swallow? Anyway fast forward to late November. I quit smoking weed. I'm due for a dental surgery and days before the surgery it feels as if I'm gonna choke on whatever is in my throat. At this point I couldn't even check my throat or put my tongue down long enough to look without gagging so much. I go through with the surgery the surgeon says that one of my tonsils is larger than the other and for me to get it checked out when I can. I go to my local hospital and they agree that my throat is swollen with a white spot possibly a tonsil stone along with swollen lymph nodes. He refers me to diagnostics for an ultrasound. This takes a month to do because I live in a rural area and paperwork and such. Anyway February 25th was my ultrasound and the results were sent back to my local doctor. He recommends a biopsy and CT scan this month. I may miss my daughters first birthday and anxiety is through the roof. I had a family member give me a clonazepam once. It was the first time I felt normal in a long time. I really should get a prescription but I dont wanna be dependent on meds. Basically raw dogging reality at this point. Dont smoke weed dont drink. No support system in place. Basically suffering in silence while I try to maintain composure. I'm newish to reddit so apologies if this isn't posted right. ,Anxiety
35526,Have completely convinced myself I have lung cancer Here are the factsIm 27F very fit never smoked had the radon tested in my house last fall it wasnt optimal but was well within safe range never been exposed to asbestos that i know of no family history of cancer. About a month ago I started having upper respiratory symptoms first shortness of breath and chest tightness that led to a cough. then i started having heart palpitations so i went to my PCP. she did an EKG which was normal and listened to my lungs and said they sounded clear. My cough cleared up after a couple days and I started getting back to normal but my anxiety was still nagging at me.About a week after my doctors visit I woke up from a nap totally unable to breathe and my blood pressure was very high so I went to the urgent care. they ran the full gambit of tests on me which all came back fine EKG blood work chest xray all normal. The doc said my lungs sounded clear. Figured it was a panic attack.I felt okay for a day or two but my heart palpitations persisted and I still felt short of breath. I emailed my doctor and she ordered a bunch more blood tests which have all come back normal except for my blood calcium which was .2 above range. This is freaking me out because I read that high blood calcium can be caused by cancer. Im doing a 24 hour urine test on Monday and then will have another appointment to talk about the results. I want to ask my doc for a chest CT but I feel so stupid asking for something like that just because Ive been feeling vaguely out of breath.I need someone to look at my situation logically and tell me Im being ridiculous. This anxiety spiral has totally ruined my life for the past month.,Anxiety

35529,How to be a supportive partner to someone with health anxiety? Hello. New to posting in forums like this but I am struggling and could use adviceperspective. I hope I am allowed to make posts like this but feel free to remove if it is violating any community rules.ampx200BI found this subreddit when researching health anxiety. My long term partner has been afflicted by this for the last 3 months. I know that is not a very long time but it's been very hard. It feels like he suddenly starting having heart problems and ended up in the ER because he called an ambulance. They said it was panicanxiety and things have gotten worse since. We have done all the medical tests and physically the doctors say he is fine and that his symptoms are anxiety. He is convinced otherwise but I see his behaviors mirrored in all of the posts here. I believe he has health anxiety.ampx200BI'm really trying to be as helpful as I can but I feel so helpless. I am trying to reassure him that he is okay but every other day he spirals into believing that he has cancerkidney diseasemuscular disordersliver cirrhosis etc etc. He even at one point thought he had an STD which was hurtful to me as his longterm partner because I have not been unfaithful and I viewed it as an attack on my character. I realize now that it is US against THE ANXIETY but sometime's it's still hard. Before all of this we used to go and do things all the time. Now it feels like we don't go out and any time I can get him out it's a chore because he feels so sick or anxious.ampx200BHe has started therapy but insists it will not help because he thinks he has a true medical problem and not health anxiety. I want to be as supportive as I can be but I'm really struggling with how to support without enabling or indulging in his fears. ampx200BSo I'm hopeful that this community can help give me some advice on how to help a partner experiencing health anxiety? What is helpful for you to hear from your partners? How can I be the most supportive partner I can be without losing myself which is how I am starting to feel lately? Should I push or encourage him to go out even when he says he is sick? I miss our old life but I don't want to force him into an activity if he really is ill. Alternatively is there anything I can do to be more empathetic? What do you wish your partner knew about your health anxiety?ampx200BThank you for your advice. I just want to understand and be helpful.,Anxiety
35530,Weird feeling on lower leg of course I'm convinced it's bone cancer I'm 24 yearsold female and I've been struggling with HA for around a year now. Mostly I have a hard time with cancer which brings me here today because I'm freaking out.Since Wednesday last week I have this weird feeling below my left knee in the front of the leg. It generally doesn't hurt when I'm resting or when I'm active it's just like the skin is hyper sensitive there and when my jeans move against the skin it hurts. It doesn't even affect my day to day but my anxiety is so over the top that I'm ALWAYS hyper aware of that area of the leg. First my mind jumped to maybe it's a cloth then it went to maybe it's bone pain but since I don't know what that feels like what do I know really? Honestly I'm just looking to see if someone ever feels weird pains and skin sensations in random places of the body had something similar awhile ago in my right arm that went away due to anxiety since it's not a symptom that I see around much.,Anxiety
35531,Anxiety Symptoms I'm new to this Reddit thing but I have been reading posts in this subreddit for a couple of weeks now and I thought I would post about my anxiety symptoms. I am recently struggling with the thought that this really is anxiety my biggest fear is of course the big Cword lymphoma for example. Everything started in November about 4 months ago on vacation in Vietnam. I experienced what I think was my first panic attack with heart palpitations pressure on chest difficulty to breath etc. Since then I have experienced so many different symptoms and sensations such as lump in throat feeling of not getting enough air difficulty to breath waking up several times every night sometimes with a strange feeling of fear lately my skin feels like its burning or is sensitive it also sometimes feels like my heart flutters skips a beat or is just pounding out of my chest but not a fast heartbeat just very hard and powerful. I also experience headaches like never before extremely cold feet pretty much all the time. Man I've probably missed a few sensations too but this is really getting to me. I've had EKG echo blood work done to test my thyroid etc and all came back clear. I'm thinking about how I feel all the time and I am noticing every little sensation in my body and the smallest thing can set me off into almost panic for a few seconds. Lately its been more of pressure on my chest and difficult to breath thats been the worst symptom. On top of this I had a cold for about three weeks ago and I felt a lymph node that was swollen this set my health anxiety off into a frenzy and I can't stop thinking about it ever since. I can still feel the lymph node I'm touching it all the freaking time hoping its gone knowing that I shouldn't and my doctor said it was nothing to worry about but as you know health anxiety finds its way back no matter what. Sorry for all this rambling but this is really affecting my life. Do you guys have similar or the same symptoms? How do you cope or how did you overcome this son of a btch anxiety?,Anxiety
35532,Can I Wait? DT2 I need to know from a nurse or doctor someone in the medical field please I had gestational diabetes last summer and experienced symptoms with it dizziness fatigue nausea thirst frequent urination headache.

I went back to the diabetic diet and started walking most symptoms are gone with doing this but if I vary at all I get SO SICK and gain 35 lbs overnight.

35533,this is just a post to make everyone laugh and realize how much anxiety really fucks with all of us my health anxiety has been bad for years every week there's something new i think i have wrong with me. last night i convinced myself i have herpes i haven't had sex in 2 months but i read online u could have it for weeks months amp year's before an outbreak i was hysterically crying to my mom and when i went to go show her my bump she laughed at me and told me it was just vagina tissue and no where near herpe sores... i love being this way oh and let me not forget to mention 2 hours after that my anxiety got bad and i convinced myself i was going to have a heart attack because i was getting random pains in my right arm and felt nauseous from my new meds lmao ,Anxiety
35534,Heart anxiety is back thanks to weird arm pains My anxiety is back. This time this weird arm pain that extends from my elbow to my hand is triggering it. Logically I know that it's likely due to the fact that I tend to lean on my left arm but my brain keeps telling me well what if it isn't? The pain usually happens when I'm resting my arm on my leg or have it bent to some capacity it happened about 5 or so times during an hour video game session but I've been lying in bed and it hasn't happened since. It doesn't seem to get worse with exertion either as I run and do other cardio and weights at least 4 times a week. It just comes and goes seemingly at random.I want to believe it's nothing wrong and it's a nerve thing at worse. My mind won't let me. To it any arm pain like this is impending doom. I just wish I could shake this feeling.,Anxiety
35535,I just want to feel normal againhow can one do such a thing? Just a college student who wants to feel somewhat sane again. Its been almost three months since my blood clot and although Ive adapted to things I still dont feel like myself. Prior to today I was living in fear constantly thinking about how things affect me and the worst possible outcome. These thoughts took over everything in my life even before this clot I was and an over thinker. Ive never been on medication for anxiety and just got on it so hopefully that will help some current thoughts of fear fade. Will I wake up tomorrow?Throughout these months I have been to numerous doctors appointments and check ups my body just wants to have multiple issues this year I guess. One problem after the next and the moment when my fear starts to subside another issue arises school. I started to feel better healthy in a way yet because I was so determined to feel humane again I fell behind. Some professors were understanding others focused more on the needed work rather than my health. Little do they all know that if my grades fall I lose my scholarship. Three years down the drain right there. How do I explain to professional people that I was afraid to live? Or that my meds persistently make me tired?I know in my heart mind and soul that there are people out there who have it SO much worse. Believe me when I say I overthink I do. You could make eye contact with me and Id think something is automatically wrong with me. I dont have time for counseling because I fear it would interfere with school. Im not one to vent no one ever has their full attention so I keep everything in. But goodness Im so tired of living in fear. The idea of being told how super rare my case was and that Im lucky to even be here lives in the back of my head. If anyone has advice with life after a blood clot anxiety college or anything I could really use it. I know my post was extremely jumbled and vague for that I am sorry. Its an accurate description of my jumbled mind.,Anxiety
35536,Heart palpitations So I started having heart palpitations when I was younger got it checked it was just an atrial flutter so nothing. Last year I was jacked up on caffeine and I'd say a little depressed and I had a stimulant induced panic attach felt like I was gonna die. Quit caffeine and could workout and everything like normal. A few weeks later I had a night of binge drinking and woke up at 5 am to my heart pounding out of my chest which sent me into another panic attack. Now whenever my heart rate goes up whether working out or drinking I start to get anxiety and feel like I'm just gonna drop dead. Has anyone else had this?,Anxiety
35537,Thyroid cancer? Lymphoma? Random infection? I'm a 21 year old male. 20 days ago I started feeling pain in the lower right part of my throat right above my collarbone. Halfway through the week I noticed a lump was there and made an appointment with my doctor. Doctor sent me for an ultrasound and found a 3cm lump in my neck but couldn't make out what exactly it was so I was sent for a CT scan. The CT scan results showed that this tumor was near a muscle and lymph node. It looked suspicious to her and she also saw 2 other minor swollen lymph nodes so she referred me to a much better hospital Vanderbilt so that they could do their own tests. That was 12 days ago. This past Friday I had a fine needle biopsy done on the lump and got the results back yesterday. Apparently cancer wasn't detected and bacteria wasn't either but I did see something about 2 polys. The test was essentially inconclusive but whatever it was it looked infectious and something on the uncommon side according to my doctor. My doctor was going to prescribe me Augmentin but since I am allergic I was prescribed Clindamycin. He wants to try me on that for a week and see if it helps. However the day after the biopsy was done I have started experiencing slight pain right under my adam's apple when I yawn or look down. Seems like there is a bump there too. I let my doctor know this yesterday but he still wants to go through with the antibiotic for a week to see if anything changes. I don't really notice any other symptoms. I think my mouth has been a bit more dry as of late but nothing crazy. I was pretty worried early on but started to get over it until this other lump showed up. Wouldn't the CT scan from just over a week ago detected this new lump? I feel like I should be relieved that they didn't find anything malignant but I'm also worried that maybe they missed it or didn't get a proper reading. I have all the trust in the world in this hospital but my nerves are getting the best of me. Sorry if this is kind of all over the place. ,Anxiety
35538,Hows do you differentiate between imagined problems and real problems? Long rant Since I was probably 1920 I have had a roller coaster of health anxiety. It all started with an actual kidney issue which later resolved itself and the only possible cause was stress. Since then I have had a huge fear of STI's which led to my ultimate fear of cancer and warts caused by HPV especially throatmouth. I have always had some form of anxiety when I was younger I'd pull out my eyelashes and scour my face for blemishes. I believe this has led to me being so hard on my self that I notice any imperfection. I have tonsil stones and while I stuck my finger down my throat I went past my tonsils this time gross I know and I felt a bump almost like a skin tag. This led to me feeling so panicked I became physically ill and left work early. Since then I've been googling and come to the conclusion that I can't keep doing this to myself. Normal people do not stick their fingers down their throat to find god knows what. Of course It's going to feel weird down there.I understand this new thought will not pass immediately but how do you guys differentiate real vs imagined issues? How do you calm yourself down? I am at my wit's end my gf is too. I'm sick of being withdrawn and lying to her about what's wrong. I'm sick of going down rabbits holes for hours on end. I'm sick of physically checking my self countless times. I'm just sick of it. Sometimes the only times I find any relief is when I am in actual distress from a confirmed ailment and that's just sad.,Anxiety

35540,2 things Hello! Ive been suffering with anxiety most of my life but got diagnosed officially in college. Anyway I am on Zoloft and am doing well. However there are two things that have been driving me crazy and I was wondering if anyone else gets this. ever since I was little I would try to fall asleep but I would have the urge to urinate. It would frustrate me SO much because it literally made my skin crawl. I would get up and only go a tiny bit. This would happen about 45 times and I finally would calm my body down and fall asleep. Well Im an adult now and this still happens from time to time. Its so annoying and Im not sure why it happens? Its such an urge to go and I cant shake it off until I literally go to the bathroom. Im on birth control and I have bad ice pick needle headaches. Ive kept a headache log and it seems to happen soon before my period. However I am convinced that I have a brain tumor or some type of brain thing thats causing me these HORRIBLE headache pains. Its always the left aide of my head and the pain feels like someone is putting an ice pick in my head real quick then over and over again. It happens minutes from each other and then some time will go by but it will randomly happen again my doctor said I could get an MRI but I dont want to because a Im scared if they do find something and b I am just crazy and nothings wrong with me. Ps. I have a nose ring that I refuse to take out because I did once during surgery and it closed up. Im a 26 year old healthy female.. on birth control Zoloft and have hypothyroidism. On meds as well basically Im just looking if anyone else has these feelings?!! Thanks so much. This community has helped a lot. Even though we all deal with this everyday and its a pain... its nice to know Im not the only one who has to suffer through this. ,Anxiety

35542,Painful pinching head pain... Very scared A few weeks ago I had a really bad panic attack about having a blood clot from a really bad leg pain..it turned out to be nothing but since then I started getting these short pinching bursts of pain on the top right side of my head in the same spot. At first they only happened once or twice a day but now some days they happen more frequently or hurt moreless. My neck and back muscles on the same side have been sore and sometimes when I'm slouching or just getting out of bed is when the pain happens. I went to the doctor and she asked my family history of aneurysms which was none. She scheduled me an MRI for next week but she said she really doesn't think it's anything.... Does anyone else get these? They also seem to happen more often when I think about it. ,Anxiety

Eating and drinking regularly playful already understanding commands but last night I was playing with him and his chew toy and he bit my finger instead of the toy my fault not his he's teething I immediately washed it throroughly also used peroxide finally placing Neosporin and band aid.

35546,On the Here and Now Looking out at a beautiful spring day I find myself buried in anxiety. Thoughts crash into my mindIve lost weight recently what if its the beginning of the endI feel dizzy oh god theres something wrong I know itWhat if I stop looking and miss an important symptom?ampx200BI am so fucking tired of this. We spend so much of our day worrying about the future or ruminating on our past. But we have only now. Our consious mind doesnt inhabit the future or the past it inhabits this very moment. Right. Now. And right now I dont want to feel anxious. Dont get me wrong I dont want to feel anxious ever but I can only change that right now. The best part? The more I change that right now the easier it will be to change that for future me. ampx200BSo starting right now Im going toSTOP GOOGLING and body checks. My doctor once told me I have googleitis and the best and only cure was to just stop. Helpful advice there. Obviously go to your doctor if you're worried about something and by all means get a second opinion if you're still concerned. Beyond that leave it to the professionals to diagnose. Stop seeking reassurance for every symptom. I know what people are going to say to me. Youre fine Statistically that only has a 0.00001 chance breathe deeply. I can do this for myself. I can be kind and firm with my own mind. Stop asking what if. Things can and will happen. Worrying about the future will never help. We can only live our best lives now and take life as it comes.Actually acknowledge statistics. Next time I feel a symptom Im going to ask myself whats the most likely cause? Pretty much any symptom can be better attributed to harmless things like lack of sleep too much coffee too much anxious thinking and so on.Recognize and challenge maladaptive thought patterns. The more I think in anxious ways the more my brain will automatically go back to those patterns. Time to see those thoughts for what they are unrealistic beliefs and fears. ampx200BI know anxiety is going to get worse at the start but I can handle that. ampx200BI can do this. So can you. ,Anxiety
35547,There is always light at the other end of the tunnel! Just a little backstory I have had hypochondria that has steadily i creased in terms of severity since late last November. Over this period of time I have been worried about going deaf having heart diseasedying of a heart attack going blind having the Hantavirus having lung cancer and the most recent one skin cancer. Throughout all of my fictional illnesses even with the consideration of how rare they are to my specific case I continued to believe I had them. I mean heck I live in Australia and there are only 15 cases a year of the HantaVirus out of the whole country. Didnt matter. My brain knew I would be in that 0.00000062 chance of getting it. Although of this considerably unrealistic thinking I still believe that deep down I knew I did not have the virus. Enter Skin Cancer. Out of all of my fears this one really stood out to me. I had an oh shit moment where I realised my petty fears before where nothing compared to this beast. Due to the fact I am a relatively avid golfer who plays without sunscreen and typically without a hat this fear was so real to me. Book the doctors in a 16 day wait I shit you not. In the beginning of this wait I was fine because my worries were on other things. However approaching the date I developed absolute chaos inside of my head. I head to google and establish... Yep... must be Stage 4 skin cancer this is the end. For the week I could not attend school maintaining the fear there was a long road of chemotherapy doctors appointments and eventually death ahead of me. Today I finally go in to the get the skin check. I was essentially prepared to have my life torn to shreds if I needed to get a biopsy and then to wait for the results of said biopsy. Doc looks at practically every mole on my body nothing. No stage 4 cancer. No risk of death. Just nothing. Although other worries have taken the limelight of the skin cancer I maintain a sense of happiness and humour about how much I work myself up. How much I google every single one of my bloody symptoms. Not just I however we all do. This story was to simply let people know that there always light at the other end of the tunnel and I cannot say it enough stop googling your symptoms. If you are really worried about something get it checked up with your doctor ASAP and put your concerns put to rest by the professional! ,Anxiety
35548,Itchiness when sweating Hi AllHope someone had some advice for this.I'm 28 and for the last 10 years plus I have had an issue in the winter months where I get really itchy when I start sweating.I can be walking to work playing football or just in a shop that is too hot and I become unbelievably itchy and have to stop to cool down.There is no issue in the summer months.Any ideas?,Anxiety
35549,Cervical Cancer I realize this is something I need to get checked out professionally though idk if it'll be possible soon. I 23F have had bloody discharge for over 2 weeks now.

35550,Am I Going Crazy? So Im a healthy 27 year old American woman today is my birthday and the last few months have been almost unbearable and I cant seem to get a grip on anything. For reference it all started last November when I started having pain in my upper left abdomen that wouldnt seem to go away. Im currently living in Spain which is where Im currently living and working. My doctor said that I had acid reflux and told me to what I ate. Pain persisted lots of mucus coming out constipation tons of gas. Decided to take a probiotic and managed to get my symptoms to disappear for a month while on winter break. Then in January the pain came back. My stools were hard and dark and the pain was consistent. Had an ultrasound and was told that I had tons of gas in my colon so they couldnt see clearly but my other organs looked good. But then my coworker suddenly began having blood in her stool too and many intestine issues. Turns out that she had worms. I decided to check my stool found something that looked like a worm went to the emergency room tool mebendazol to get rid of the worms This also made sense because I lived in Asia for 2 years before Spain and had just recently moved.Just after my first dose of mebendazole I started to have a weird feeling in my lungs. Felt like I couldnt breathe in all the way but that was it. Anyway in addition to that I began to have sinus pressure a mild sore throat and drainage. I took my second dose of the worm medicine had a stool sample that came back clear of everything no blood and even a chest Xray that was clear. Ive been secretly worried that I have colon cancer since a friend of mine suddenly died at age 25 from it. She had no symptoms and went to the doctor with a persistent cough and ended up having stage 4. Since my lung issues flared up Ive been so worried that I have some cancer that has metastasized and went to my lungs. I havent been able to completely shake this cold yet and its been over 3 or 4 weeks. I still wake up and spit up yellowish colored spit. Lungs feel a bit off. To make matters worse Im still having stomach problems after being cleared of the worms and my doctor says that I probably have IBS. Then last night I began having heart palpitations and rushed to the emergency room. My EKG was normal and my blood test was normal. She said I have pvcs and need to relax. Honestly I just feel like Im shutting down and I havent felt healthy in a long time. I cant seem to shake this chest cold my digestive problems are still there have some reflux too and now pvcs. I feel like Im a mess... just spent the morning of my 27th birthday in the emergency room getting the tests on my heart. Can anyone relate?,Anxiety

35554,13 trips to the hospital from 2018present went to the ER last night. Near trips to the hospital Almost daily. Hey guysI am really suffering in a way that makes life absolute torture. I have health problems however they're compounded significantly by my constant fears of death and cardiovascularheartrelated health anxiety. Does anyone here ever feel like suicide is rational when your life has been distilled to daily panic attacks of the worst kind and constant thinkingfears of sudden death or further disability i.e. strokes fatal arrythmias heart failure etc.I don't want to die I fear the unknown so intensely however I feel that I deserve dignity and mercy for my situation.

35555,Swollen lymph node rash dermatits and surprise another lymph node today What the fuck is going on with my body?In October 2018 my perioral dermatitis flared up again after accidentally eating gluten. It was around the time of the holidays and i was stressed due to major family issues. December comes and I start to notice and itch on the back of my neck. I also notice after I eat a heavy meal I have this mild pain on the left side under my rib cage. Spleen? January the rash is a deep red unbearable itchy oozing and now paired with a swollen lymph node.I change up my diet to vegan because I figured it was keto catching up to me. That helped and the rash slooowwwwllly got better but still lingers. Fast forward to this week the itch is mostly gone but the lymph node is still there albeit smaller. Yesterday I finally got my hair done because I couldn't previously with it so itchy. I noticed a deep pimple on the opposing side of my scalp. This morning I now have a swollen lymph node where the pimple is. I also am hardly eatingnot very hungry and have managed to lose around 10lbs in a month but this could be due to vegan mostly raw diet.

35556,Head pains are worse then ever lately. Been fearing a brain tumor for a year now and I constantly get terrible heard pains. It can be on the top of my head either side wherever. They go in straight lines and hurt very very bad. I had heart fears last year and had chest issues but as soon as that cleared up the head fears started and have lasted for a year now. Im scared constantly and think Im going to die. These pains are just so intense. Maybe its brain zaps from missing medicine doses but Im not sure. Its been going on so long now and has been at its worst this last week. Its like Im having an aneurysm each time in the area its at and it scares the shit out of me. Anyone else got similar feelings?,Anxiety
35557,So anxious I literally just ran out of the dentists office Basically title.A couple months ago I had a consultation to get a few teeth deep cleaned and two small cavities. No big deal for normal people but I really dislike needles and put off going back.Today I go back and they insist on doing the deep cleaning of the whole mouth for 500 while saying it doesn't look bad on Xrays so the insurance company probably won't cover it. When I said I can't afford that the hygienist basically scolded me and went to get the dentist.I started feeling like I was having a panic attack and removed the bib from my neck put on my coat and bolted to my car. I still feel shaky now. Idk what's wrong with me. Don't know if I was being scammed or I just made myself look really foolish.,Anxiety
35558,Punctured my hand with wire Was doing my art project and ended up stabbing myself with some wire an hour ago. It bled a bit and stopped my arm kinda sore. Because of that I'm now freaking out that I could get tetanus. I don't think I've gotten that shot before and I heard you need it to stop tetanus. But I have really bad anxiety so I wouldn't know if I'm imagining any pain I'm feeling.I don't even know why I'm worried the puncture was like 1cm deep but I'm still panicing about going to the doctors to ask if I should get the shot Its always something with me always feel like I'm about to die everyday ,Anxiety
35559,One spot on my spine feels tender I'm worried it's cancer. I haven't been worried about my health for a while so this didn't concern me much until today. I notice that when I hunch over or when I press on this particular spot on my back near where my bra strap would be it feels like I bruised it. It's not painful enough to disrupt my day but it's a little disconcerting. I started googling and I saw a bunch of people who had this and it just went away on its own or it wasn't anything but then of course I continued googling and back pain can be cancer. It's surfacelevel though really does just feel like a skin bruise. And I don't feel it at all if I sit normally and don't press on it.How worried should I be? Any way I can rule out cancer? I'm seeing my doc for a checkup soon.,Anxiety
35560,Could those symptoms be caused by stressanxiety? Afraid of cancer Ive been feeling really anxious about some things Ive been getting recently. It started with sudden onesided tinnitus at my right ear for at most five seconds. Ive dismissed it since it seemed to be common. But then Ive started to feel lightheaded for one or two seconds randomly which led to more searching and the discovery that one sided tinnitus could be a red flag for cancer. And thus started my anxietyBesides the tinnitus and lightheadedness Ive also had some muscle spasms. Not really common once or twice a week only and its just on the fingers of the right hand along with a a weird twitching feeling on what I suppose is the median nerve. What left me more alarmed though is that today my vision suddenly became blurry accompanied by a headache lasting for three or four seconds. Never had that before.Ive been very anxious about this and Im hoping that those symptoms are not that uncommon or at least anxietystress induced. Should I go see a doctor or just wait to see if it gets better? TLDR lightheadedness onesided tinnitus SBUTTs some hand twitching and quick head pain with blurry vision. Hopefully its just all anxiety,Anxiety
35561,Possible mono...maybe something worse Noticed swollen tonsilsscratchy throat last Thursday. Still hasnt gone away but developed a persistent headache that intensifies with movement thats been going on for like 4 days now. Obviously think its a brain tumour. Went to the doctors yesterday morning and they did a basic physical and did some neuro tests because I complained of strange intense headaches. Doctor ordered some blood work to test for mono but to only go through with it if my condition worsensAll day today I was extremely tired. Had to stay up to write a final essay but then around 3 am I start shaking uncontrollably chills and was burning up. I felt like I couldve thrown up any second. My fever reached 38.9 C which to me is extremely high. I took an Advil about an hour and a half ago but my temperature is still the same. Im too scared to go to bed because Im worried my fever will skyrocket and Ill die in my sleepIve been so good with my health anxiety lately and now this just randomly came along these are the only 2 outcomes in my headI either have mono which I actually wouldnt be too nervous about because then at least I know whats wrongI have cancerDo you think this new fever warrants the blood test for mono?

35563,23 year old male with Lymphoma like symptoms Hi everyone!ampx200BI have had an interesting few months and would like to share my story with everyone! Would love some feedback given I am not seeing an Internal Medicine Doctor until the end of April.. Here goes!ampx200BBackground informationIn May 2017 I had a nice EBV infection that lasted a year. Additionally I have thalassemia minor which I believe has never effected me and Asthma which is mostly brought out due to my dust allergies. ampx200BCurrent issuesIn February this year my cheeks randomly started swelling which has never really happened to me before. I didn't think much of it but after a week of them staying swelled I visited a Doctor. He said it's likely due to the cold weather and sent me off. About a week later I developed a nasty lung infection it caused my lymph nodes to swell like crazy and a very mild sore throat for a few days. I went on Antibiotics and the symptoms went away. About a week after that I got food poisoning which then eased itself out after a couple days.ampx200BAfter the food poisoning however some of the initial symptoms came back. My cheeks kept swelling and my lymph nodes on my neck were overly active. I went to the doctor and he gave me some Ventilin and another inhaler as he thought it was due to lung inflammation. ampx200BA couple weeks later I started developing fatigue I could sleep 10 hours and feel as if I didn't even go to bed. Then at around dinner time every day I would feel sick to my stomach and extremely light headed I didn't get it but thought maybe I was just stressed. ampx200BI then got another lung infection which went away naturally but after this one the facial swelling and lymph node action came back harder than ever. I even started developing numbness on my temples during night time and have been noticing almost rapid hair loss on my hairline Never had any signs of balding before. Which now leaves to the last few days..ampx200BI went into the ER yesterday as I knew this was problematic. They said they couldn't find anything alarming in the blood tests but did notice my spleen was enlarged and that they will perform an ultrasound. The results from the iron test and stool analysis won't be back until next week.ampx200BI'm going to be honest I have had health issues my whole life this is the first time in my life where I am really really scared. I have googled the symptoms as you do.. And really the one that fits the story the best is Lymphoma..ampx200BI'm curious to hear what people think.ampx200BThanks for reading!,Anxiety
35564,Chest pain anxiety. CHD amp open heart surgery survivor. Apologies for this wall of text. I just need help. So I'm new to reddit and to this sub. I know that chest pain is a very common symptomtrigger of HA but I haven't been able to find any resources about cases similar to my own although I'm sure they must exist out there. So I am a moderately healthy 25 year old woman. I excersise I eat healthy I was slightly overweight as a teen but I've been at a healthy weight for the past 45 years. I was born with a somewhat serious congenital heart defect CHD an atrial septal defect ASD to pe precise. At the age of 5 I received corrective surgery for this defect and have been considered healthy and symptom free ever since this surgery. I have had no major health events since this time and I have never had any sort of restrictions placed on my physical activity levels by my cardiologist. 4 years ago I entered into a long distance relationship with the man who would eventually become my husband and it was around this time that my HA began. I believe it was triggered by my fears that something would happen to one of us while we were apart and that we would never see each other again because of sudden death due to illness or a freak accident. I began to be plagued by images of him dropping dead of a heart attack or getting hit by a car same for myself. We lived in 2 different countries and usually spent 89 months apart in between brief visits and as our time apart progressed I was aware of new unhealthy habits forming googling symptoms anxiety induced nauseachest painsnumbnesstinglingjaw pain. We are now married and have been living together for a year and although I am happier than ever all of my bad HA related habits have decided to make a home in my brain. I feel so unlike myself as I have never expeirenced anything quite like this before. I was so caught up with dealing with a long distanceinternational relationship that I didn't do anything to stop the progress of this anxiety and now it has become an integral part of my day to day life. Like many of you I experience chest pain numbness tightness tingling and nausea and I have been to see my doctor on a few of these occasions and have been told that I am fine. I have even been to the hospital same results. Again I know this is all very common for those suffering from HA. My added complication comes from my history of heart defectheart surgery. I wish that I could just erase my knowledge of this event since it really exacerbates my HA and often sends me into a spiral. Although I know most of my chest pains are benign the fact that I have had major surgery lends just a bit more credence to the HA voice telling me I'm dying and this is destroying my mental and physical health. It doesn't help that I can't find any resources on living postop from a pediatric heart surgery in your 20's30's and what to expect as you age. All of the materials I find online about what to expect after a heart surgery are clearly directed towards 55 year olds which is very alienating. I am always the youngest person in the cardiologist's office by several decades and I've never met another person in my age group that has had open heart surgery. I've looked for support groups for young adults living postop from CHD's but I haven't been able to find anything. My question is this. Does anyone on here relate to my storysituation? Does anyone here have a history of CHD and open heart surgery? Since I can't find any information about this my HA is telling me this is because they all died young and my time is limited although I know this cannot be true. I just want to talk to someone about their experience with this and get support from people who know where I'm coming from. AH and CHD open heart surgery are an abundantly shitty combination and I know my current anxiety levels are unsustainable. I can't live like this. Even if you haven't had open heart surgery any adviceresources would be welcome. I'm very overwhelmed and not sure how to deal with this. ,Anxiety
35565,Unsubscribing today. Thanks for all of your support. This sub has helped me through a lot of health concerns but today I'm finally in a place where I can deal with it on my own so I'm posting to hopefully help someone else.I started off as a mess and eventually got a full heartbody checkup including an MRI and wore a heart monitor for 24hours to check out my palpitations. After being told that everything is fine that was a big step. Getting a professional comprehensive medical diagnosis to rule out what you're worried about goes a long way. After chest pains numbness tingling in my limbs dizzy spells being sent to the ER because urgent care thinks I might be having a stroke and a ton of other shit something outside my control changed my stress level. I took on a different role at work that is much less stressful. I had no idea how big of an impact this was because I didn't consider myself stressed but several symptoms subsided with this change like everything digestive and the chest pain is less frequent. After I was told the chest pains are costochondritis inflammation of the rib tissues read stressinduced I saw a chiropractor for about 5 months who taught me some stretches and selfadjustments I could do with a back roller and now I've trained myself not to panic when I feel those chest pains. Just do the stretches and trust that I'm fine and sure enough I am. Also my doctor told me to cut caffeine and I didn't listen. I am a coffee junkie and cut back but didn't cut it out entirely. Well recently I switched to decaf I know stick with me and it's been lifechanging. Yes this is obvious. Yes we all know caffeine raises your physiological arousal level. But many of us keep consuming caffeine not realizing just how much it actually contributes to the cycle. I'm a much happier person on decaf and I don't think I'll go back. I found out all of the shit I was dealing with can be caused by anxiety. So this whole time it was the fear of a health problem that was causing health problems. Stress impacts us more than we realize!So to recap here are the things my dumb ass put off doing forever that really made a huge impactGet a doctor's opinion. As in a thorough one if possible instead of just a quick visit. They will run some tests and give you a professional take on it. When you get this TRUST IT. If you have reason to believe the doctor missed something get a second opinion but really you should trust the doctor.Manage your external stress. This doesn't mean quit your job but if something is stressing you out a situation at work a significant other family take some real steps to get out of that situation! In my case it was a lateral transfer and a change in responsibilities but man did it lower my stress levels.Cut the caffeine and any other stimulants including recreational ones. If you struggle with anxiety your brain is already pumping you full of stress hormones in a fightorflight response. You absolutely do not to make it worse. Even a little can impact some people like me apparently.For the love of Reddit never Google your symptoms.The terrible thing about anxiety is once it has you it's a downward spiral. But the inverse is true too. Once you are confident in your situation and know the quirks of your own body you can come out of it quickly too. Hope this helps someone.,Anxiety

35568,Lightheaded dizzy after walking I 33m222lbs recently started my weight loss journey down 27lbs since january and started going to the gym this week. I spent 45 minutes on the treadmill just walking and afterwards felt very dizzy and lightheaded. I make sure to drink lots of water throughout the day.

35570,Antibiotic cocktail and side effects Disgusting me has a bacterial infection in the stomach and I'll have to take 15 pills every day of antibiotics to get rid of it. Normally I won't take a look at the side effects because I know I will go insane about them but after my mother saw the prescription she said I should consider another form of antibiotic treatment that only has 70 success rate compared to 95 but less side effects. SO I looked up the side effects and its worse than anything I've ever taken. It's nausea and diarrhea and vomiting in over 10 of cases and a condition with black burnt skin and multiple organ failure with unknown probability. As I'm already vegetarian and you're not allowed to eat dairy products I have to go vegan for a week and I'm not allowed to go outside in the sun cause the medication will cause my skin to burn in the sun.I can't find the side effects for the other therapy but I also I want to be done with the whole thing if I survive the ten days. I'll probably take the pills but I will properly go crazy and miserable too.,Anxiety

35572,That awkward moment when your health anxiety was 110 accurate. Fml. Ive spent my whole life not feeling right. My immune system has always been shit. Seizure activity as a childteenager. Anyways Im 25 now and I had my adrenal gland removed a few months ago due to a benign hormonesecreting adenoma. It was found via MRI in October. Not even a couple weeks after surgery I noticed extreme mental changes. Which led to paranoia. And then I lost 30lbs and stopped sleeping completely. I would get SO angry over shit that wasnt even important and I had to literally shut it down by cutting myself off from people. My hormones were a mess according to labs. I just KNEW something else was wrong.A week ago today I got an MRI which confirmed a brain tumor of the pituitary. I have to have my concerns because I work in the medical field and I usually know what something is the second it starts creeping up. But I thought it was impossible to have another one present itself even though my last tumor was benign. Fml.,Anxiety

35574,I feel a colon cancer meltdown coming on I probably wouldnt be worrying so much about colon cancer if I hadnt spent nearly 24 years of my life being fed ultra processed foods and then going on to cook ultra processed foods for myself. I wish I was more self informed about how bad this food was for me. Im just now starting to figure out whats good for my colon even though I thought I was doing things right eating frozen vegan patties which may be even WORSE now that I think about it. I was worried about processed MEAT only and not processed meals in general.Ive had hemorrhoid symptoms lasting over 2 months now itching and bright red spots. Bowel habits constantly change. Lot of gas bloating and nausea. Feeling hungry more than usual. I had diarrhea for the first time in a month and a half last weekend no bowel movements at all for almost 4 days.

35575,Wall of Eye Floaters Help So I have floaters. Evident by the fact I'm posting here. Whether they stay or go away in a few years I don't care. 23 so I have all the time to wait. One thing that I've recently noticed though is that when I almost close my eyes completely and look up at the sky during the day I can see an entire faint sheet of what I assume is the liquid my floaters are in and I can see the entire field of my vision is in what essentially looks like a very faint wall of bubbly protiens and crap. When my eyes are wide open it's harder to see but in the sky I can still ever so slightly notice it. My question is has anyone had this along with the more prominent floaters and did the wall eventually go away? I don't mind the individual ones but having literally all my vision be through this murky shit is stressing me out.,Anxiety

About 2 weeks ago I masturbated dry way too much and I injured myself and my ejaculate was slightly pink and i had groin pain. I rested and put ice in my groin area that night and a week later I felt better. I ejaculated again and it looked fine but there was a weird piece of something it looked kind of like old dry blood it was dark red and tiny. It happened again recently about another week apart and now Im freaking out. Did I injure myself really badly? Should I see a professional? Or just wait longer than I am again to heal properly? I cant find anything like this online so Im freaking out. Please help.,Anxiety

35580,I just found out I'm diabetic. What now? Hey folks. Yesterday I went in for a routine DOT physical to get my medical card updated. These happen every two years to make sure my health is in check for driving a rig. So I go in to my appointment. I give a urine sample. There is a massive glucose concentration. They use a diabetic meter and my glucose level was a 257. With almost no symptoms apart from occasionally dry mouththirst. I went and immediately got an a1c test to determine what's going on. I understand this won't find Type I but it's worth doing. I've taken my blood sugar three times since. Last test yesterday was still in the 250s today it's been 157 for two tests.I'm worried. I enrolled in insurance yesterday because I'm not financially prepared for the lab work but I cannot continue driving until this is diagnosed and handled. I bought a bike to start trying to get my weight down and keep active. I'm internally freaking out right now. I've always had good health minus a little extra weight. Any advice? Thanks ,Anxiety
35581,Been putting off taking an antibiotic Hey guys I have been having symptoms of a UTI for a two weeks now and I was prescribed originally Cephalexin for 5 days this didnt get rid of my symptoms. On Monday I went to my Primary Physician and she prescribed me Augmentin but I have been too anxious to take it.

35583,walking mess yesterday at work i would be drinking water normally and would notice a sharp pain at the top of my head but would think nothing of it at first. several sips later the sharp almost electrifying pain would occur in the same exact spot it had before. so i kept sipping and noticed that it only hurts at first and the pain goes away if i continue to drink repeatedly. fell asleep with hopes of waking up with it being gone but unfortunately the first sip i took gave me the same incredibly sharp pain in the same exact spot. i can swallow my own saliva and eat food without any problem.. when im not drinking anything i can still feel a slight pulsating pain in the top part of my head my left eye is spasming uncontrollably and my ear on the same side hurts when i apply pressure to it. ive tried researching the pain to see if its worth visiting a health care professional but cant seem to find anything. should i be worried more than i already am?,Anxiety

I know it doesn't really make sense but when I am sick infection fever etc. people always tell me I should go to a doctor. But I never will. I don't know how to explain it but the diagnosis would just scare me. The last time I went to a doctor was because I got vaccinated and because of my tinnitus. I'd rather just stay home and suffer.

35586,Health Anxiety is a Beast Im just having one of those nightsweeksmonth where the anxiety is piling up. My son was recently diagnosed with a form of epilepsy and my daughter will be starting speech therapy soon amongst other things going on. Ive had pretty severe health anxiety over the course of my life 32f but this year it seems to be peaking. Im currently on the tail end of a week long brain tumor worry and I found my self going down the Google rabbit hole again tonight after reading a news article about silent brain tumor symptoms. Its been a rough night. I really thought I could see the light at the end of this tunnel. Ah well. Just looking for some support and maybe we can cheer each other up.

Had a CT scan I didnt need because I wanted to check for cancer of the pancreas liver and colon I know this isnt diagnostic and while all of those important things are golden....the ct showed mild urinary bladder thickening is noted anteriorly this may be secondary to underdistension. Have had a few drs tell me that that means my bladder wasnt full so it looked thicker. Is that good enough for me? Nah. Has to be bladder cancer. Gonna try to get a urologist to give me a cystoscopy because I am CONVINCED this time THIS IS THE TIME itll be real. I fucking hate myself. My PCP begged me to not need the referral to the urologist. He left it in my hands and I had to take it. sigh oh 37F ,Anxiety

35590,How do we know that it is SVT rather than VTach? Very rarely I will have these 5 to 10minute episode of sudden high heart rate above 180. I learned that this is may be SVT. I have already seen a cardiologist and she did all sorts of tests and concluded my heart is structurally normal and there is no worry. But no test has ever been able to catch these rare racing heart issue of mine. I have had these since I was a kid decades ago. And I do have them every couple of months or sometimes there will be 1 or 2 years between attacks. No other symptoms except the racing heart which feels like it's lightly beating so fast I once counted up to 200 bpm. On Holter the worst they caught was a few isolated PACs.ampx200BNow I have been reading about VTach and this seems to be dangerous kind of arrythmia because there is a chance if can go to Vfib. Yeah we anxiety sufferers are a hypochondriac bunch.ampx200BSo how do I know what I have all along is NOT VT? Now I am so afraid to be left alone and so afraid of those attacks whereas before I learned about VT I did not mind them too much as my cardiologist assured me I am okay. But now I am always thinking what if these are SUSTAINED VT rather than a more benign tachycardia??,Anxiety

I'm not really sure how to cope as I've only really had significant HA since early last year. Recently I've been having palpitations amp arm pain I'm checking my heart rateBP almost hourly.

35593,Left pinky finger numb So this is day number 3 and my finger is still numb. I can move it but I heard that numb fingers or tingling in your left hand can be a sign of a heart attack. The thing is I went to ER twice and my ECG was good. I have slight tachycardia and I'm not convinced that I'm healthy despite the doctors telling me everything's fine. Chances are low at 29 and as a woman to get heart issues but I can't believe that my anxiety is producing all these symptoms. On top of that I have neck sternum and back pain and I'm dizzy. My blood pressure is 10669 but my pulse is always over 80. But the worst part is my hand and especially my pinky finger. Did anyone else have these problems.,Anxiety

I am a 20yr old male soon to be 21 that has indeed been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. I have dealt with these issues for around 68yrs of my life. Part of my anxiety issues is changes in eating habits. Things such as me not eating when get a full blown anxiety attack feeling some stomach cramps when eating certain foods or eating them in certain locations and sometimes feeling discomfort when I have a BM but not all the time.I am writing this because this week has been super stressful causing me to have a few anxiety breakdowns one major one yesterday. Today is the aftermath and my mind is really letting me have it. As of now I'm hungry which makes me anxious which makes me not eat which makes me feel sick which makes me more anxious. It's perpetual TI don't want to keep going through this. I have been to many doctors have not been given meds and have underwent many tests. I also did go see a therapist for a while but stopped going when my anxiety issues went away.my point isShould I go back to my psychiatrist reopen my case and perhaps get medication?Or perhaps this is seems more like a digestive issue and I should see a gastroenterologist?Or should I go back to see my therapist?Or lastly do all three?ltampx200BIf you left a comment below I thank you for your support.,Anxiety
35595,Struggling with fear of carcinogens everywhere Hello just wondering if anyone has advice info anything relating to this would really be great I have a problem with fear about contamination but mainly in the form of longterm damage ie being exposed to a unknown carcinogen or drinking water with lead or exposure to anything that is deadly harmful but only through exposure over time.This is mostly fueled by any story of new chemical used in products and only 51020 years later people confirm it's a carcinogen otherwise dangerous.Because of this I get stressed out with chemical things like cleaning products detergents anything scented general air pollutants clothing dye any drinking water plastics touching food heavily processed foods and so much more. I'm struggling to get over it because these cases do happen and I wouldn't know there was a problem until it was too late I can't shake the feeling it is rational to at least have some skepticism... but I know it's impossible to know about everything and I want to stop stressing out so much. any coping tips or advice would be great thank you. ,Anxiety

35597,Pro tip don't Google symptoms if you're logged into Facebook. They will use the data from your searches to give you relevant ads and articles and it will exacerbate your HA. There have been times where I've frantically googled the symptoms for everything from MS to brain tumors to ruptured ovarian cysts and shortly afterwards I would see an ad or an article about something related to it nearby gynecologists cancer centers etc. But since I've stopped doing that I don't see them as much anymore. It's been really helpful in taming my anxieties. Googling something once every so often doesn't affect the algorithm too much I don't think but when you're a chronic symptomchecker like I used to be triggering ads definitely start becoming more prevalent. So resist the keyboard and just breathe. ,Anxiety

35599,Super anxious Hi everyone. So Im freaking out right now. I'm really scared that I have HIV. I moved to a big city at the beginning of the fall for college and I decided to try hooking up. However it was always an instinct to use a condom when participating in sex. I've always topped too. But I stopped after a couple months because I felt like I was doing too much. But about a month ago I hooked up with another dude. I've topped every dude I've had anal with and I've used a condom every time. However I'm so scared that I have contracted HIV. I keep looking up the risks and everything. From information to use condoms to condoms don't always work my anxiety has skyrocketed. As I type this my cheeks and neck are red hot causing me to think I have a fever. It's more of a deep blushing feeling because my face is only affected along with my arms. But when I tell myself I'm good my cheeks go back to normal causing me to think I'm jinxing myself. In addition I feel a little more tired than usual.I'm just so scared. I protected myself but I don't know if something went wrong along the way. I don't recall a condom breaking but sometimes the other dude would give the condom to me and Im scared that they might have done something to it. I'm just so frightened. I tell myself that I should go to a nearby clinic and get tested but what if something results that makes me fall into a depression. The semester isn't over and my life would completely change. I just need some piece of mind. My spring break wasn't even relaxing due to me freaking out. Any advice?,Anxiety
35600,Depression or fear of it? Hi guys this is the first time I post in this subreddit so let's get started! For about two weeks I have been feeling very frightened about the idea of being depressed also because this anxiety is accompanied by a kind of weight that I feel inside my chest and that accompanies me all the days. I haven't lost interest in activities or in socializing but when I am at home alone I start to think and look on the internet for symptoms and feelings about depression and end up feeling scared anguished and sad with this feeling of heavy head and the impossibility of thinking positive.What do you think is it all the fault of anxiety and hypochondria that have been with me for years or is it the beginning of a depressive phase? ,Anxiety
35601,Random Twitching ALS Fears I was hoping to find some relief here. About 5 months ago I had some bad panic attacks with high blood pressure likely due to high stress. Same deal thinking I had heart issues. I've been on the generic version of Buspar and a blood pressure medication since then. Things seems ok until I started to have panic attacks again. A friend told me he had twitching issues with the Buspar so I'm hoping maybe thats it. For the last 34 weeks I have been having all sorts of weird twitches EVERYWHERE. Mostly been in the bridge of my nose but also in my back head arms neck abdomen legs knees elbow and butt. It's very random just a small twitch here and there and there seems to be no pattern to it. They usually will last a couple seconds. I've been having bad anxiety and stress lately. My wife and I had a baby recently and when I got back to work from my leave a bunch of people were laid off. A week into being back at work I started having bad panic attacks chest pain reflux I started to get spasms in my esophagus and trouble breathing which made me think I was having a heart attack. I then started obsessing thinking I had a heart condition. I got checked out by the doctor and some blood work done and everything checked out ok. I was relieved to hear that things were fine. My doctor switched out my blood pressure medication but then I started getting muscle twitches all over. Thinking it was because the medication I went back to my old BP medicine but after being off of it for over a week it's still happening My family has a history of ALS seems to happen later in life 60 but when I googled muscle twitching my anxiety completely went off the rails. The twitching seems less severe but it's still happening.I went back to the doctor do more blood work check for an electrolyte imbalance. I should have the results back at the end of the week. I started CBT last week with a therapist but the unknown leaves me constantly fearing the worst and I'm finding it hard to find relief. I haven't been sleeping well because of the baby which could be contributing to the problem. Has anyone else had issues with muscle twitching following panic attacks?,Anxiety

35609,Maybe you do have a health condition but it's more likely to be benignchronic than whatever you're imagining I used to have bad health anxiety. Until I was diagnosed with POTS postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.What is POTS? At it's core it's an increase in heartrate when you're standing. To be diagnosed you need to have a standing heartrate that's 30bpm higher than your supine lying down heartrate.But what is POTS really? It's a complex condition of the autonomic nervous system. There are dozens of possible symptoms all somewhat benign ranging from heart palpitations to nausea to trouble regulating temperature. Some people with POTS aren't affected much while others are confined to a wheelchair because of their fainting spells. Yes it can be a terrible experience but it is not fatal.So why am I telling you guys this?Because there's a 100 conditions like POTS. Simple relatively harmless conditions that make you feel uncomfortable but pose no risk to your life. To name a few Raynauds disease intensely cold fingerstoes Fibromyalgia painaches in muscles Arthritis pain in bones Asthma difficulty breathing TMJ jaw pain headaches Crohn's disease abdominal pain gas diarrhea vomiting Cyclic vomiting disease recurring vomiting spells Ovarian cysts pain in pelvis back or side Hypothyroidism fatigue weight gain hair loss Anemia fatigue coldness Sleep apnea sleepiness snoringI'm not saying that it's easy to live with these conditions. No way. Most of them suck. HOWEVER they are not cancer they are not heart disease they are not multiple sclerosis.So when you're listing your symptoms focus on what the most probably cause. Neck pain? You probably have text neck. Stomachache? You probably ate something that your stomach doesn't agree with. Headache? You probably have some environmental or dietary trigger.rhealthanxiety is very near and dear to my heart. I spent many anxious nights terrified because of heart palpitations difficulty breathing muscle cramps. I can't tell you how much of a weight off my shoulders its been to have a diagnosis. I should've mentioned that the caused of my POTS is mitochondrial dysfunction which comes with another huge slew of symptomsI hope anyone here with an undiagnosed chronic condition can find a diagnosis and treatment asap. I know it's hard to keep your head on straight until that happens but try to! You are your best advocate.ampx200Bampx200B,Anxiety
35610,Health anxiety is affecting my relationships Ive been a worrier for all my life about everything. Health anxiety is just a part of it. Now Ive come to the point where its starting to negatively affect my relationships especially with my partner. The worst of it being that i got drunk lost memory for a bit became convinced that i was taken advantage of and contracted an STD and created a weird situation in my relationship. There was no indication that this had happened other than a minor cold that i was sure was a symptom of a disease.Understandably he is upset and i felt guilty. It was awful and were still in the middle of it. This has to serve as a wake up call that my life is so negatively affected by all this. Ive been festering at home all evening not being able to do anything but worry. My head is in pieces. All ive managed is to use reddit as an occasional distraction. I need help i feel like im lost in this. The point of my post was to hear success stories of others overcoming these fears and honestly to just find some hope and support. ,Anxiety
35611,In need of some advicesupport Hey all! First I want to say thank you to everyone in this sub. Ive been quietly reading your posts for months now and it is truly the reason I dont feel so alone anymore. Ive been dealing with health anxiety since I was 12. I saw a poster in the nurses office at school which explained the symptoms of menengitis and spent almost a year touching my chin to my neck to make sure I was okay. Then it turned into having anxiety about HIVAIDS and lymphoma. My anxiety was so bad I had to drop out of my dream college because I couldnt handle it. I felt happy for years after that. I focused on other things. But this January something changed. I suddenly began feeling everything I used to before. Constantly worried about various diseases even after being reassured that I was okay. Its straining my relationships with my family my boyfriend and my friends. My constant reassurance seeking is making everyone lose their patience with me. I feel like I cant handle it anymore. I sleep most of the day because thats the only time when the terrible thoughts dont come. The worst part is this feeling I like to call happy...but. It occurs in situations where I feel happy but cannot truly experience the moment for what it is because Im worried. Im happy...but I could have a disease Im happy... but it will only be for a little while until the anxiety comes back. Anyone else feel this way? ,Anxiety
35612,My fear if brain eating amoeba is ruining my life ? I'm new here but I've been to counseling multiple times and I still can't get myself together.So it all started in December when I was taking a shower and a droplet of water got in my nose and I snorted it it ruined my entire Christmas cause for two whole weeks I was waiting to die. It totally traumatized me I never got over it even when a month passed. When I shower I hang a towel nearby and wipe my face whenever it gets wet . When I wash my face in the morning I dry out my nose with a cloth after even if I'm late for work. When I brush my teeth I hold my breath. When it's raining outside I breathe with my mouth . Sometimes when it's raining a truck will pass by and water will splash on my face and I'll need to go to the nearest gas station and get a tissue to dry my nose out if anything even got in there. I don't go swimming anymore even though I used to do it as a sport. I'm always careful when drinking water I'm even scared of my own spit when I laugh of it getting up my nose. I guess I'm just scared of water as a whole now I know my fear is irrational and I can't even get the infection from most of these things. Also I live in Canada where we've never even heard of this stuff before.I even read you could get the intention from soil or dust. So I'm afraid to breathe in or touch my nose with a lot of things that I think have dust on them or dirt. I never even put my hands towards my face anymore without washing 45 times first.I've started having severe existiential crisis caused by this I'm always scared to die and it keeps me up at night. I just want to be normal again like before and not worry about these things anymore but it's so hard.,Anxiety
35613,Blood in post nasal drip When I wake up in the morning and only in the morning I have what looks like blood mixed in with my phlegm. This has been going on for about 3 or 4 days. I also recently got over the flu. The blood has been dark for the most part as if it's been there for several hours and once there was bright colored blood mixed with the dark blood and phlegm.The phlegm is extremely sticky to the point I can't clear it from coughing but have to physically wipe with a qtip. I instantly am worried I have cancer or some other life threatening illness. I do have cobblestoning on my throat and believe I have some form of acid reflux. I also sleep with a fan on. Is this a combination of my seasonal allergies fan and acid reflux drying my sinuses out which is causing the blood or something I should take more seriously.

35615,Anxiety over therapy Hii! I live in Belarus and in my country there are no CBT practitioners. All our doctors can offer is pills. Maybe talking therapy. I don't want to spend my time just talking about my anxiety it's not gonna help. I've been struggling with anxiety throughout my life. I had OCD sometimes still have it but overcame it on my own using Internet and articles of Dr. Steven Phillipson. I had GAD just general anxiety 247 and overcame it by accepting using the book by Claire Weekes Hope and help for your nerves. Now I suffer from severe health anxiety. I've read some books and other sufferers on forums told me some techniques. What I've been using is more ACT acceptance and commitment therapy than CBT. And it was quite helpful for me. I have always had problems challenging the thought it's much easier to accept it and let it float past me as clouds as just anxiety. Lately I've read on Wikipedia that CBT is a goldstandard approach. And developed anxiety what if yess classic whatif thought the approach you've been using is wrong and is not recognized by therapists?. I lack confidence although I have tools. But I continue googling. I understand this is just another anxiety about the therapy maybe a sign I'm recovering.,Anxiety
35616,Panic pain and tingling in limbs is my birth control driving me crazy? Hi there everybody! It's my first time posting here but my anxiety is skyrocketing recently so here's a quick summary of my problemI feel constantly stressed and pressured due to mental health reasons. Last year during a very stressful stretch at work I passed out the first time and I've had dizzy spells ever since. Had blood work and an examination with a heart rate monitor made nothing major except for a slightly lower blood pressure. Thought I was going to die the entire time of course but it got better then aside from me growing obsessed with my health.Fast forward to today. After stressing for a whole month that I might've gotten myself pregnant I finally started birth control on the 16th thinking I might finally chill but nope! Now I'm convinced I'm developing a thrombosis or something worse. I had a panic attack last week that my SO had to talk me through thinking I was having a lung ebolism and now suddenly my right foot wrist upper arm and leg hurt I get tingles in my right little and ringfinger and occasionally there's this burning sensation around my knee and elbow that just... make no sense whatsoever? Travels to my left side sometimes too and my hands are often cold.Can someone please tell me that I'm okay? I've been to my doctor so many times this month because of different things and I'm so embarrassed to turn up there so often for little to no diagnosis. I should know my symptoms are too much over the place to be anything serious but I just want to go through a single day again without me obsessing over every little pin amp needle that I'm feeling. ,Anxiety

I went to my doctor and asked the opinion of many people in the tattoo and health field and they all say I'm fine but I can't stop thinking that I could've ruined my entire life and it wasn't even my fault.ANY ideas on how I can make myself feel better? Thank you,Anxiety

35619,Bleeding after having bowel movement So Im a 24y female. And every time I have a bowel movement I bleed. There wont be blood in the stool but when I wipe. This has prompted me to... inspect my asshole if you will I feel weird admitting this. Anyway i have tears that bleed. It feels slightly painful while in the process of defecating but after Im ok. Now I know this probably just anal fissures but at times I worry that it could be serious. Ive been taking cymbalta for almost a year to help me with my health anxiety.I just need to know if anyone else has anal fissures and how to combat them? This is making me nervous Everytime I use the bathroom. Sometimes the blood is minor sometimes it can be a good amount. It seems like when the year is ALMOST healed I make it come back .I also do strain.. if that could be a reason. Thanks for reading and replying if you do,Anxiety
35620,IM 23F FREAKING THE FUCK OUT All last week was getting headaches and I never get headaches or have allergies Friday and Saturday when sitting down for a while and would stand up my head would feel very heavy got dizzy and dull pain enough to make we wince.Monday morning woke up sucking from my throat a decent amount of blood mixed with my mucus. Constantly since Monday morning sucking up either bright red blood streaked all through mucus or just straight up like dime to penny sized black blood clots in mucus. Seriously every couple of minutes sucking it up. Occasionally will stop for 30 minutes or so but always starts up againHavent been sick or coughing or had nose bleedsWent to doctor on Tuesday they sent me for blood work which still isnt ready referred me to and ENT. Saw them today they put a scope down up my nose and down my throat didnt see anything ordered an XRay of chest and MRI of my brain. Xray wont be ready for 2448 hours and MRI people arent even calling me schedule until Monday. Going on four fucking days of spitting up dime to penny sized blood clots and Im just sitting around here probably fucking dying while I wait on all these tests. Did ease up a bit today just smaller bits of bright red and dark black blood throughout the day towards end of day started to turn more brown than red or black and I started to feel better until I just spit up a huge black clot.

35621,Kidney infection anyone? 21M Had some weird urinary symptoms. Left it longer than I should have. Health anxiety struck and I'd convinced myself it was a UTI that'd spread to the kidneys and obviously death was imminent. Went to the walkin and they said urine looked good no UTI but they'd do the STI tests. Whatever.Now I'm convinced that they didn't look hard enough into the UTI and that it's already spread to the kidneys and gone septic. I started feeling sick and got a fever last night. Probably a cold or something cuz I was out in a big city all weekend but obviously it's all connected in my mind.Taking everything in me to not go to the ER and wait to go to the nonemerg clinic tomorrow.,Anxiety

35623,Got a bloodtest scared to hear about Leukemia. I've posted this in rAskDocs but I just wanted to hear more. Sorry. I'm seeking as much support as I can that isn't from people close to me because I don't want to scare them too. I'm a 18 year old female living in Canada. Half Chinese Half Russian. I have always had pretty good health for my entire life so such a sudden change in health is scaring me to death. For the last week my skin suddenly changed. I have never really bruised no matter how hard I would hit my knee on something no bruise would ever appear. My family always joked about how even if I fell off a building I'd be completely fine since my skin was so thick. For the last week I've noticed weird changes in bloodclotting. I pick at my acne sometimes gross I know and it would be fine the next day however suddenly now when I wake up I see a HUGE blood scab and bruising around a small white head I picked at the night before. It made me look diseased but I brushed it off as something silly. Then my legs and arms started having weird red dots all over paired with bruising in odd places like the middle of my thigh where I would never get hit or hurt. It isn't a rash and my doctor appointment confirmed today that it wasn't a rash too. Not only were my legs and arms covered in these red speckles but my chest upper belly and my gums were too. The days before I was surprisingly out of breath. I was out with my friend and constantly needed to sit down after a couple minutes of walking. Even in the bus I was extremely uncomfortable with standing and would squat in the middle if there were no chairs because I could not stand to stand. My friend joked about it and so did I as I usually would walk quite fast and wanted to go everywhere. Such a sudden change left her a bit weirded out too. I finally decided that I was freaked out enough to go in a walkin clinic. The doctor said it MIGHT be hemophilia and sent me to get my bloodchecked. Now I'm waiting anxiously at home and can't get the thought out of my head. I know it's useless to be afraid and think about it but I've never had such a sudden health change in my life. As I'm typing this I feel strange little zaps in the joint of my right hand. I haven't really told my friends and definitely not my parents as I don't want them to worry. All I can do is wait. Some pictures of my skin There are more bruises but they are a bit more faint either way I don't do enough physical activity to seriously injure myself in these many places.,Anxiety
35624,Concussion worries I hit my head on a concrete wall last weekend and got a mild concussion confirmed by doctor yesterday Ive been sitting letting myself heal at home and was playing with my cat with one of his toy lightsabers. I held he tip as he played with the handle of it. I thought to myself while daydreaming could you imagine if I hit myself in the head with this and while in he daydream apparently my body acted this of and I hit myself in the head with the handle at its full length. Now Im worried that Ill cause serious damage because my doctor gave me a pamphlet to avoid head injuries after concussions because it can cause permanent damage. It wasnt super hard but it was still a hit. Ill just keep resting and try not to worry about it. ,Anxiety
35625,Extreme fatigue. Anyone else relate? For the past 5 months my fatigue has been very overwhelming. Worst I've felt in all my life. My symptoms are fatigue malaise generally feeling unwell light body aches randomly not all the time very tired sometimes my body feels heavy and unbalanced which then triggers anxiety because I fear I might pass out. It's so bad I can't focus on life or work. I struggle daily to get out of bed.Few facts about me.

I don't excercise much mainly light walking with my dog or in hallways at work I suffer from depression and anxiety I stopped taking the 5mg Lexapro cold turkey after being on it for 5 years 2 months or so after I stopped the symptoms and fatigue started I reinstated 0.5mg Lexapro using liquid solution made from water. I have only had 1 blood tests in my life at age 26 and I didn't fast. They found my vit d was 20ml but everything else checked out.I want to die. I feel like death.

I'm proud of myself. I listened to what she thought it was what to look for and I decided not to feed my anxiety and see if my symptoms go away on their own. I'm honestly a bit amazed with myself.,Anxiety
35627,Chiropractic adjustment on neck now scared of cervical artery dissection This will sound ridiculous and it is embarassing to even type but that is what we are all here for to get these issues out in the open and find people who can support us right so here it goes. I am a 27 y.o male and have been seeing my chiro for years because I would get headaches. He uses the drop table method and I have had my neck adjusted 100s of times before. Last week I went to my doctor for an unrelated visit and mentioned I was seeing a chiropractor. He responded right away dont let him touch your neck he told me that an older patient of his had had a stroke days after a neck adjustment because of a torn artery. Now I will mention that the chiropractor this patient had seen was using a different type of manipulation on the neck as opposed to the thompson drop table method. At my chiropractic appointment yesterday he did what he normally does and worked kn my back and neck. this time my neck was sore all night and I have not been able to sleep or focus on work or my kids because all I can think about is what if he tore something what if I am going to have a stroke???? seems silly right? Anyone who has health anxiety knows that these ludicrous thoughts seep into our mind and pollute our rationality and thinking. I have all but convinced myself I am going to have a stroke and die and leave my kids behind fatherless no matter how crazy I know it sounds. My neck hurts as of writing this but very mild discomfort perhaps a 2 out of 10. I would assume if you tore an artery you would feel it? Anyways I would love some responses maybe just to reassure me or if anybody has some insight on an issue like this they could share.cheers,Anxiety
35628,Fear of MS . Ok first time posting here. I'm 21yo.So to make it clear i've never had panic attacks or stuff like that so I don't know if I truly suffer from health anxiety.Now in the past few weeks I have had 34 episodes where my finger would get kinda tingly for a few minutes at most and three days ago my right hand felt tingly for 30 minutes or so I then went to see my doctor who thinks I have anxiety who told me that it is almost certainly anxiety but if I keep having these symptoms for the next 15 days I can come back and he'll make me get an mri or something like that i'm not sure.For the past three days I only felt tingling for a few seconds in my feet and I am CONSTANTLY fearing that the symptoms will come back like I can't go 2 minutes without thinking about it.Also since I was younger wherever I laughed a lot like a lot as in those cases where you laugh for minutes and almost cry my face goes numbshaky or trembles and the same thing happens when I'm anxious sometimes and especially after I am relieved.Lastly like 2 years ago or so my left lower back and hip felt like they were sunburnt for 3 days for no apparent reason.I can't go on like this I am CONSTANTLY thinking about it and expecting symptoms to show up...I don't want to die..,Anxiety
35629,Tips for letting things go? TLDR at endI am 17 recently coming off a fear of having visual snow. I had read about it and essentially convinced myself that I had it. I am no longer anxious about that however and I am now on a depersonalization scare. I have had HA for a few years all over things that havent been problems. Recently for about a week I have been afraid that I have depersonalization disorder. I dont have the same symptoms and I dont truly believe I have that disorder but sometimes when I think about it the disorder or when I think about the fact that something could be wrong with me everything feels surreal for a few seconds. I have wierd thoughts where I think Im actually here and doing things. This can often happen after i have been on my phone for some time or when I have been distracted and I snap out of it. I believe it is just snapping back to reality and my brain has taken this and made it into a problem. Im pretty sure everyone experiences this from time to time but since my brain thinks its a problem whenever I think about it I feel that feeling. I realize it could also just be an awareness of how many things I do without really thinking about it every day like tying my shoes and my brain thinks that because I am not truly thinking about what I am doing I am depersonalize. In conclusion do you guys have any tips for realizing that youre ok and letting things go? TLDR I have HA feeling weird I know nothing is wrong how I do convince myself that Im ok so i can forget?,Anxiety

35631,Ready to look into medication but anxiety began with...medication.. Help me? So my story with health anxiety being a hypochondriac whathaveyou actually started with medication.. I was using Xanax for a good while things kind of spiraled for me and went from a when I am having a panic attack use to a full blown addiction. Blah blah.I think it might be important to add I ABRUPTLY kicked this addiction in a single day after being given a clearly not RX Xanax laced with something horrible almost died huge ER bill. The whole 9 yards. That was enough for me was the last time I have taken so much as an ibuprofen. This was the middle of 2017. This RUINED ME. My anxiety over this one night has vastly affected the past 2 years of life without a doubt.Fast forward through a long time of the absolute hell of withdrawal and just pretty much seemingly permanent drastically increased anxiety that didnt exist on a scale even close to this before even being put on Xanax. Went through a decently long period of CBT talk therapy lifestyle changes etc. kicked a large amount of the anxiety. The agoraphobia social anxiety extreme fear of any male lol BUT here we are present day..... I just can NOT kick my health anxiety. I cant. If its not one thing it is another. This is an every other week thing where I am completely obsessed with a new thing. I wont name them all as I completely realize that can be very triggering but I am currently fixated on breast cancer. I dont think I can do this any longer the constant obsession and panic and symptom analyzing noticing every mark or spot on my body etc. And I sure as hell know that I cant afford it either. I am going absolutely insane over all of my diseases So the point is I am ready to seek out a medication option.... But how does someone whos anxiety has literally all stemmed from a single pill go about this? What are some of your experiences? How can I convince myself to begin a medication when I cant even take a Tylenol? How do I shake the fear of another medication further screwing up my brain? Getting very desperate and need a little push or insight to really shake this thing. ,Anxiety

35637,Concerned for CoWorker Vision Problems Im reaching out on behalf of a coworker. Over the past three weeks he has been having progressive problems with his sight. Im not sure of all the details but he has been to a family doctor an optometrist and a doctor that specializes in how the nerves relate to eye sight not a neurologist cant remember the name. Im not sure of all the tests performed but he claims to have explored just about every route possible and no one can tell him anything! I asked him what the next step was and he told me there were no next steps.He is 64 years old and has had cataracts previously but has been fine in the six years that Ive known him. He wears glasses due to being farsighted. The problems started about three weeks ago and have progressed to the point where he cant make out anything that he cant make anything out glasses or not that is more than about 1015 feet away from him. I was talking to him this morning and standing about that distance away and he said he couldnt make out the details of my face.From his explanation if you take each eye and break it off into quadrants each week he starts having problems in a new one. So he had problems in one quadrant in his right eye three weeks ago. Then problems in another and so on. Currently he has blurry vision in three of four quadrants in his right eye and one of four quadrants in his left eye. Beyond this I dont have much more info.Does anyone have any insight as to what this could be? Or what steps he could take?Thanks everyone!,Anxiety

Im trying to see a psychiatrist but does anyone have advice on how to deal with the health anxiety so it doesnt get to the point where I feel the need to go to an ER? Is there any benefit to seeing a cardiologist or checking on these anxiety aches and pains? Is there such a thing as health related PTSD?,Anxiety

35645,Don't know if I legitimately messed up my neck or if the stress is making it this way For the past 3 weeks I've had stiffness and discomfort in my neck. For the first 2 weeks I'm pretty sure it was a legitimate issue of carrying heavy bags on my shoulders while traveling. It started to feel better but then I felt the back of my neck with my hand and I noticed a hard lump where my skull meets my neck. It seems reasonable that it would be my spine but I've never felt it before now and it's close to the surface and large. It seriously freaked me out and now I can't stop messing with my neck and pushing on it. It is now stiff again and hurts. I convinced it was my own fault from messing with it and being super stressed out again. But this morning I also noticed that when I move my head side to side in a certain position there is a crunching sound that almost sounds like sand grinding. It makes my head and neck feel almost dizzy but seriously uncomfortable. I don't know if that is real or anxiety. I'm going to the doctor on Monday but I'm afraid they won't take me seriously but I think I may have legitimately messed something up I. my neck. I'm young and this came on rapidly so I don't know if I screwed it up from traveling or what. But I'm seriously scared since it's near my spinal cord and I will go paralyzed or have to get surgery. Has anyone dealt with this? Crunchingsand sound in neck seems to be a common Google search but no satisfying answers.,Anxiety

When i stop thinking about it the tingling stops too. My right knee is kind of stiff too and before this tingling started my legs were stiff but this stiffness has been happening to me since years.

And my mother pulled me off my medication. I just don't know what to do anymore my anxiety is being my depression back. I literally can't function with it I'm afraid to drive hangout with friends work go placed alone meet new people and performing in bed. Just stupid shit my head is constantly overflowing with thoughts I can't control. I try so hard I'm aware when I'm having a panic attack then it just leads to more thinking. I vomit when I have an anxiety attack. Just today we had to play basketball in gym and I went to the bathroom to fucking throw up I don't even know what causes it. I just want to get surgery I don't even care of it will fuck me up I'm just at that point. I can't live life like this No I'm not suicical. Please just give me some ideas of procedures I could do. And don't tell me to meditate see a therapist or stay on my meds longer. I've tried it all. I just need to know if there's any surgeries I can do. Thank you.,Anxiety
35657,i cant tell if its all in my head or not and its trying me crazy New around here but Im so glad this sub exists since I know I tend to be very aware of my health. Sorry about the length. TLDR at the end. Four years ago I started to develop occasional constipation. It was nothing a little dried fruit couldnt solve and it only happened every so often. So far so good.Then it all started going downhill after I had a kidney stone when I was 17. Ever since then Ive been struggling with constipation daily. Since diet change wasnt helping I went to my moms GI doc and had my first colonoscopy at 17. Fun. The test came back clear and the GI sent me home with directions to take Miralax daily. Fast forward a year no change. Miralax helps but it was like going from hard stool constipation to soft stool constipation. Went back to GI where I was diagnosed with IBSC with no further testing and given a prescription of Linzess. Two years go by still no change. Linzess works but not as well as it used to. Not only that but I was now dealing with worse symptoms and felt as if my guts just werent moving. I was still have a bowel movements almost daily but it was never without a laxative of some sort. I tried the lowFODMAP without much change either. I did eliminate dairy and gluten from my diet cleared a ton of my acne once I did that.I decide to get a second opinion. Saw a different GI. He suggests a blood test and does an endoscopy. Ended up getting diagnosed with GERD and chronic gastritis. Also he found food still in my stomach despite not eating anything 13 hours beforehand. GI sends me to get a gastric emptying study done. That test ended up turning out normal too. Blood test was also normal besides for a low of lymphocytes and a low number for buncreatine. Neither of those were that much lower than the normal range. All and all I was given a clean bill of health.But if these tests are coming back normal besides the GERD and chronic gastritis then why am I still having symptoms? Why is it getting worse over the years? It was just constipation at first which Im sure is just affects your colon. So why am I having upper GI issues now? I constantly deal with regurgitation constipation nausea cramping slow moving bowels gas bloating low grade fevers etc. I cant even do exercise without throwing up. I used to swim varsity in high school and now I cant swim an entire 50 yards without running out of the pool. Doesnt matter when I eat or what time of day it is. At first dried fruit did the trick but when things get real bad not even an enema or magnesium citrate work. But on other days they do. Why it is that when I try to talk to a doctor about it they dont listen? Is it because Im only 20? Even my parents are sick of me constantly feeling ill especially on vacations. Ive been diagnosed with depression anxiety and ADHD but wasnt given any medications until last year so I know it didnt start because of medication. What if it really is all in my head? What if Im just doing this to myself by stressing over it? Im transferring from community college to university this fall. What if I cant do it and have to go home? Whos gonna believe me if these tests just come back normal? But I just know something is wrong. Why else would I still have these issues if everything was okay?Im going to a gastroenterology motility clinic at Stanford at the end of April to get one last opinion. I just feel like Im wasting so much money. Im probably the only person that wants a diagnoses at this point. I just want answers. But at the same time what if the results were right and there is nothing wrong? I dunno. I just have so much anxiety now around food and eatingshitting in general. It wasnt like this last year until things slowly started to get worse. TLDR Been having bowelstomach issues for years. GI doctors slap on IBS diagnoses but Im worried its something worse due to worsening symptoms over the years. But also worried that there really is nothing wrong and that the stressanxiety was it all along. Stressed about wasting money on pointless tests thatll all come back normal even though every day is a struggle. ,Anxiety
35658,looking at my computer causes sickness amp pressure. Is this anxiety??? For the past two months ive been dealing with the worst anxiety due from insomnia. But this is not my first bout with this. Ive dealt with this back in 2010. I wanted to ask. Does anyone get these weird terrible feelong or pain in your body when you look at your computer screeen??? Its like a pain in the throat all the way down going into the chest area??? Its like a weird MILD pressure on your body. It feels like reys coming out the computer. I ahvent felt this in years. I forgot how i got better because it was so long ago. Back then i thought i needed glasses amp thought it was the monitor. i thought all kind of things. But now im thinking this can all be related to freaking anxiety. ampx200BIs this common with anxiety??? ampx200BThanks so much ,Anxiety
35659,Do you ever find your symptoms change or transfer to different areas? A couple of months ago I started getting this sharp pain in my upper right abdomen just below the ribcage. I'm 27 and regrettably eat a fair amount of takeout so naturally I assumed this to be gallbladder issues. I ended up getting it checked at the ER one night when I got some really sharp pains and found a bump in that area. The doctor was convinced the bump was just fatty cartilage and since the pains seemed to happen at random and not after meals that it was likely not my gallbladder. They scheduled an ultrasound anyway which turned up with no issues which I was happy about.ampx200BThat said since then I started getting neckback pain which didn't really concern me given my crappy posture and I've always had a fair amount of neck tension. However in the past couple weeks I started getting random shoulderarm pains that come just as quick as they go and today i started getting quick sharp chest pains though I'm convinced the chest issue comes from some recreational smoking last night with some friends.ampx200BAnyways thinking about all this made me wonder if many other people here have dealt with anything similar and honestly typing this all out has helped me deal with some of the anxiety which is a welcome bit of relief.,Anxiety

35666,How to cope with panic attacks triggered by health anxiety? I can't stop worrying about something that probably isn't a big deal. I can't calm myself down I'm freaking out and I'm all alone and everyone I know is busy so I can't call them.I found a spot on my body that hurts to touch and afterwards an area near it started to feel strained without having to be touched.

35668,How to help my husband Hi there! I am a 28 YO F married to my incredible 37 YO M husband who suffers from health anxiety. It comes in waves. He has gone through some therapy but she wasnt a LMHC so it was kind of pointless. He is on a low dose SSRI and that usually helps. Until we see someone who has MS. Oddly enough my maternal grandmother had MS. He does not have any history of it in his family. He does not know his paternal grandfather and sometimes that is his excuse for why he thinks MS might run in his family. Anyway we saw a friend who was recently diagnosed with MS over the weekend and his anxiety has been through the roof. I have severe anxiety and OCD so sometimes I spiral once hes spiraling but usually I can keep my cool. I am trying to find a way to help him. He has no real symptoms but has some issues that lead to similar symptoms. For example hes a graphic design teacher with metal screws in his wrist so he frequently gets odd sensations in his hands from working on computers all day but of course thats the MS not the likely carpal tunnel or arthritis he has going on. Any suggestions? He is open to therapy but I dont know that he will stick to it since the episodes are so few and far between. What can I do to help?,Anxiety
35669,Low pulse rate Could 1.5 weeks of exercise result in lowered atenolol dosage? I have been taking 100 mg atenolol daily for quite some time now several years. I was prescribed it for an elevated testing heart rate of about 90 to 100. No history of heart problem negative stress test. The atenolol seemed to be doing it's job as my resting heart rate fell to about 70 bpm. Fast forward about 1.5 weeks ago I changed my diet and started walking about 3 miles every day 90 minutes. Today I notice that my resting heart rate is 50 bpm. I would not think the exercise could improve my heart rate that quickly but could it? Could such little time exercising be lowering my heart rate such that the atenolol can be decreased tapered down over time?,Anxiety

35674,Afraid something is extremely wrong with my heart Hey guys. I lost my job in March due to Gastritis from unknown causes. Had an endoscopy and biopsies. It's just gastritis and they think it may be due to my gallbladder but I will be having tests for that in about a week. I have been extremely ill with that since the beginning of January. Lost almost 20 lbs. In pain all day. It's great. ANYWAY throughout this time and I think right before but only rarely I have been having having issues when I stand and start doing usual activities. My heart rate soars when I stand and when I begin doing everyday things nothing strenuous I even get sweaty sometimes and short of breath. This scares me so I have to lay back down and then it immediately goes back to normal. I have a history of PVCs the palpitation where your heart skips a beat. I saw a cardiologist and he did not see anything and said it was pretty good except he vaguely mentioned some part of the ultrasound being slower and he told me to exercise more. He didn't explain any of that. That was a year ago now. I realize I have been laying on the couch for about a month now but could that cause all this? I also often have low blood pressure but I've never had this happen everyday. Could it be any of these causes or maybe since I haven't been able to eat much anymore? My anxiety is driving me insane. Someone please help. ,Anxiety

I just did end a course of Antibiotics about 34 weeks backdoxycycline. Im worried it might be cancer. Theres no blood in the stool.

35679,I recently remembered multiple sclerosis exists A few weeks ago I felt a weird pulsating sharp pain in the back of my head I promised myself I wouldn't google it but by the end of the day I just couldn't let go. So I googled it and worried for days I had occipital neuralgia but it went away and then I remember the next suggested disease multiple sclerosis. And now I just conviced myself all the weird symptoms I had and went to the doctor only to be told I'm completely fine must be because of MS. Like the times I thought I was having a heart attack because of pain in my left arm or when I thought I had a detached retina because my eyes felt weird and I thought I saw flashing lights. When I focus on something really close to my eyes and then focus on something far and feel a little desoriented etc etc etc. It must all be neurological after all!And now I feel all these things again and I keep thinking what if it isn't psychosomatic. On top of it I'm going to be without insurance for a few months while I'm in between jobs and neurologists and MRIs are just waay to expensive. How the hell do I convince myself I'm going to be fine?,Anxiety
35680,Anaphylaxis fear This is probably the most ridiculous manifestation of my health anxiety yet. I've basically developed an anaphylaxis fear mostly related to food even though I've never had a foodrelated reaction in my life. You hear all these stories in the news of people randomly having anaphylaxis reactions and my scumbag brain assumes it's gonna happen to me. This has made eating pretty much anything an incredibly stressful experience. Eating is one of my favourite things to do especially trying new food and anxiety is even affecting that now.Does anyone have any advice? Or even some statistics that could perhaps put my mind at ease? I am worried this will turn into a fullblown eating disorder in which I only eat limited quantities of what I consider safe foods.,Anxiety
35681,How often does y'all's anxiety cause you to actually feel symptoms of whatever it is you're currently afraid of? Hey so for a grand total of 2 days I've been convinced I am developing Parkinson' Disease and after reading up on various symptoms and whatnot I feel like I am actually starting to feel them. This is not something I've ever worried about but now that the idea is in my head it's all I can think of. I'm trying not to fixate on it as I know I always do this with different things but idk I just want some people to relate to lol. Knowing people are going through similar things as I am usually calms me down at least temporarily.,Anxiety
35682,I'm relapsing on my past HA at least right now. Long post In October of 2017 I had my first actual panic attack and it was massive. I never figured out where it came from but I ended up in the ER for fear of a heart attack. Had all the symptoms just about. This occurred about 23 more times within a week or two and it got to the point that the doctor got frustrated and told me I was wasting the ERs time and money on potential people who may actually need it and gave me a low amount of Xanax and a referral for a therapist. After then I had lingering chest pains for seemingly 247 so I also went to a cardiologist and did several tests from ecgsEKGs to wearing a heart monitor for varying times with one month being the longest. Turns out my heart was 100 healthy and the healthiest he had seen in years which was surprising considering I was a smoker and drank too much caffeine and drank a bit too much. I still smoke drink caffeine and drink here and there but I've cut down tremendously since. I was in therapy for 6 months. It mostly involved us talking things through but we also got to a point where I would try to purposely induce attacks so we could with through them together in order to learn how I can tackle them by myself. Another thing we did that helped was write down my current health fears biggest one was fearing a brain aneurysm would come at any time because of my constant headaches and ice pick headaches and I would also write why it was making me scared. Then I would come back for my next visit two weeks later and she'd have me read what I wrote and it always sounded insane but never ever for me to stop being worried entirely but overtime it got better. I was diagnosed with hypochondriahealth illness anxiety. I have since moved to California after being in therapy for 6 months. For whatever reason it was like a complete 180 from worrying about it all the time to not worrying about it much at all anymore. I would still get some attacks here and there but I always managed them one way or another.Lately I've just been more down than usual and I plan on seeing another therapist to try and tackle that but I think it's partially making the hypochondriac I am come back out. Example about two nights ago I was getting ready to take a nap but I was on my phone for a few getting settled propping myself with my right handarm on my side. Later I would wake up and I started gaming a bit after but I noticed my upper right arm and lower shoulder have sharp pains after moving it a few certain ways. I brushed it off because I figured I probably put too much strain on it when I was on my side before my nap. Well it's been a few nights now or so and while it hasn't gotten worse it hasn't gotten better I think. Fine whatever. But then I noticed pains in my forearm closer to my wrist that would come and go slightly. Then I started feeling that later in my right forearm. Today I was pulling weeds and when I got back up my shins had sharp pains for a few minutes. I was feeling off and lightheaded and thought I may be dehydrated because I drank last night and didn't really do a good job keeping myself hydrated then. So I did the worst thing possible I googled dehydration symptoms. When it becomes severe and should seek help etc. Granted this was just all on the same page but I didn't have to read it. I legit just wasn't sure if it was dehydration and it did more hurt than it helped. I'm feeling better after some water but now while I'm not constantly Googling anything on the exception to see what the symptoms of dehydration were and effects it could have on the body I'm fighting that feeling of being worried about the pains I mentioned above. If it was just the shoulder pain or just the here and there forearm pain or the mild discomfort I feel in my fingers... basically if I just wasn't feeling pain in varying intensities and one or two areas I could easily reason with myself.I haven't seen my doctor in a couple months and I'm going to make an appointment in the morning and talk with her about it and see what we can do as well as probably set up to see another therapist for what I'm assuming to be depression. But I'm feeling myself slipping again and I'm not ready to deal with even a fraction of what I dealt with before.,Anxiety
35683,Dizzy after coughing spells...is this normal? For the last week I've been battling a cold. It's mostly been a normal cold except for one thing.

Obviously I dont have Munchausens because I wish that I was not sick.

35685,Tired of dealing with this Im 17 yr female Im pretty slim and small and Ive noticed Ive had a fast heart rate for a long while now but lately its gotten bad. Three months ago all of a sudden felt dizzy my heart was racing so I went to the doctor and they took blood work which came out normal and sent me to a cardiologist. Im guessing it was my first panic attack? My ekg was normal he said he heard a heart murmur but thought I was okay and i had anxiety. He didnt even feel the need to check my heart. But I still did a 48 hour heart monitor didnt really feel any symptoms but it was still normal he just said I had sinus tachycardia. This was a about a month or 2 ago and it feels like now everything has gotten worse. My heart rate is always 100 and when Im walking or stand up its 140 sometimes. I was also walking to class upstairs and I was gasping for air and my heart was racing. The highest my heart Ive seen my heart go is 195 which doesnt sound healthy. My heart rate will also go from 50 to 100 randomly which concerns me? Yesterday morning I woke up with my heart rate at 170 so I went to the ER and my ekg was normal. My parents think Im fine and the doctors say Im young it wont hurt me and Ill grow out of it. I have anxiety and panic attacks now because Im always worried about my heart.

35691,Concussion anxiety taking over my life Let me just preface this by saying I've been essentially the hugest hypochondriac my entire life even to the point of freaking out over a bat maybe biting me after it flew over my head once. I've never been this anxious about anything because getting a life threatening TBI is my hugest fear and it's basically consumed me.Almost two full days ago I slammed my head four times within two or so hours against a few different walls. Not ruthlessly hard but just hard enough to worry. I matched basically no concussion symptoms at the time but it hasn't stopped me from flipping out excessively. Since I woke up yesterday though I've gotten minor potential symptoms that made it so I couldn't function in my normal life without freaking out which has worried me. While I didn't get a headache I had minor nonpainful yet strange feeling head pressure especially when moving it slight sensitivity to light occasionally feeling dazed me not being able to remember or place words in sentences etc. It became rough trying to figure out which 'symptoms' were from me freaking myself out and which could be potentially real. I even stopped drinking coffee because I'm so freaked out caffeine could make my 'concussion' worse.The worst part came last night when I dozed off while hanging out with friends watching a movie around 8. I couldn't sleep. I kept jerking myself awake and my body refused to do anything heart racing and it got to the point I kept taking 20 hour power naps until midnight where I'd wake up in a total daze with some of the worst anxiety I've had in my life. So reasonably I Googled symptoms to subdermal hematomas which freaked me out even more because now I'm convinced I have a brain bleed. I woke up this morning and I still feel dazed still shaking even though the only remaining concussion symptom is me feeling pretty dumb and detached from the world. Even after friends who've had real concussions reassured me nothing's helped in fact me Googling shit made it worse like always. I guess my rant results to me asking whether or not I'm justified being like this. I've been honest to God debating on just driving to an ER or something immediately despite potential freakout and the fact I'm only 18 because almost nothing else has entered my mind. The anxiety has been consuming me and I'm 100 convinced I'm dying and it's the worst.,Anxiety
35692,Hello I could use advice...I am suffering from rather severe health anxiety. At least I think I am? Hello I just want to say I'm really sorry if I break any of the rules! I am a bit confused as to what is allowed I don't know if there is a point to this I am just...confused and scared.I am 15 and for the past years I have experienced extreme fatigue to the point where I sleep 15 hours a day when I can. But how do I know if this is real? I could just have a bad lifestyle. I try my best to stay healthy and do everything the doctor says but it doesn't go away. I also believe I could be faking it? I experience a lot of weakness and like...memory problems. I also get chronic pain in my thigh which is really painful. But the thing is...there is nothing that could cause this? I don't think there is. It is incredibly random am I making this up to seem like something is wrong? I have previously been diagnosed with depression and GAD but I got those treated. But I am still worrying about this? I am on medications that have helped so why am I still anxious over my health? They worked for everything else I think it is something in my mind because I keep getting Dreams that make me feel no one can be trusted or that I will be yelled at or do something wrong. How do I even know if I'm suffering from health anxiety? What if I am just exaggerating everything? Maybe I am just a person who is afraid to grow up or that I am immature...I am really sorry if this broke any rules or didn't make sense. I guess it was just an outlet! I have been scared for a while now. Thank you for reading if you have any advice on something I could maybe do to help calm my nerves I would appreciate it very much ,Anxiety
35693,Chest pains earlier today. Scared to go to sleep. Hi all. I'm new to this subreddit and so glad I found it. Ever since I got pregnant currently 13 weeks I've been experiencing a ton of health anxiety. This is new for me so it's especially terrifying. Earlier today I had chest pains and got in the car and drove to the ER. Once I got to the parking lot I calmed down and felt better. I didn't even go inside. My chest seemed to relax and I was okay enough to drive home and listen to a podcast to calm down. I've had panic attacks for as long as I can remember not specifically related to my health until now and this just felt different than a normal panic attack. I've never had chest pain with my panic attacks. A few minutes ago I started getting the chest pain again. It's been hours since it last happened. Does this sound like anxiety? Would chest pains related to a heart attack come and go throughout the day? I'm currently afraid to go to sleep due to the chest pain...im worried ill die in my sleep and not wake up if I'm experiencing pain. Thanks for any responses in advance.,Anxiety

35695,How many of you got a CT scan done on 15 plus years ago? Where was the scan done and did you develop any cancertumor? I am asking because there are many articles on the possible link with ct scanners and cancer. Should I worry about it? I have had two abdominal ct scans done and two head CTs. ,Anxiety
35696,I'm a lot scared about my mom's lower leg pain Hi! First of all I made a second account to talk about these personal issues I use my personal account which has my real name for a lot of public things and didn't feel comfortable in sharing those personal issues there.ampx200BMy mom had breast cancer six years ago and treated it successfully doing chemo and radiotherapy. Fortunately it was diagnosed very early. She is totally cured now and constantly monitors her breast and thyroid which she had some benign cysts. She is 60 and doesn't smoke or drink at all.ampx200BLast week she removed a dot on her face. The biopsy returned Basal Cell Carcinoma but with no spread on close lymphs. The dermatologist said it was nothing to worry about.ampx200BBut yesterday she said she had been felling pain around the tibia for about a year and half. It's a pain she feels deep that comes for some time like a week then disappear for some months then comes back. It doesn't seem to be affected by exercise but hurts at night. While she was pressing the region to show me where it was she said she could feel it hurt a little even if at that moment it wasn't hurting the way it used to. There is no swelling at all and she said it never was. She also said the pain is the same since it begun. ampx200BAnd she had been having some cramps a while ago the doctors said it could be a neuropaty caused by the medications she took like tamoxifen. She also said these cramps usually stops when this pain begins.ampx200BShe said she's worried about it being a bone metastasis from the breast cancer.ampx200BFrom what I know it's extremely unlikely that a metastasis from a cancer she treated back in 2013 and which in that time had no secondary tumor detected could only appear now. ampx200BBut I'm extremely worried about other cancer possibilities. Like a primary bone cancer or a secondary cancer from a hidden tumor that originated in other part of the body.ampx200BThe rational part of me says it's probably neuropaty or even some other symptom caused maybe by her age and if that pain was bone cancer she probably would be gone now or at least the pain would have gotten worse after all this time or even some swelling would have appeared.ampx200BBut the other part the same that worried about me having ALS because of some twitches says it could be cancer. She has an appointment with the same doctor that treated her cancer on Monday but until then I can't help but be terrified about this possibility.ampx200BHas anyone had any similar experience? Is the rational part of me probably right once again?,Anxiety
35697,One tonsil swollen? Has this happened to anyone else? I'm just now getting over a bout of a really bad sore throat I had for a couple of weeks. I had significant post nasal drip at the time too. I went to the doctor and she said it wasn't strep and she figured it was just an upper respiratory infection and that it just looked like swelling from irritation. My sore throat is mostly gone but the tonsil in question still appears to be swollen or have a lump behind it. I know that it's probably just because of the illness but I'm worried and I don't have health insurance and it's very hard to see a doctor without it here. I don't want to go back and them tell me it's nothing. Has this happened to anyone else? I'm 24 F and i used to be a smoker but I've quit for about 7 months now,Anxiety
35698,my urine is clear for no reason for like a week now my pee has been barely yellow to almost clear even if i hadnt really had anything to drink during the day. theres no pain smell or excessive amounts its just the color. i know this is probably nothing to worry about but my anxiety is worrying me that it might be something bad and i just went to the doctor so i dont want to go again ,Anxiety
35699,Scared my doc won't take me seriously Hi all I'm a new here I've had health anxiety for about 6 years it comes and goes a couple of times a year for me but when I have an episode it's BAD I'm talking like exacerbating my own physical symptoms by worrying googling for hours until I'm convinced I'm going to die hell even obsessing over my pets health and running them to the vets for every tiny thing although that mostly started after my old kitty died of lymphoma.Anyway so I'm really worried about going to the doctor next week that she's not going to take me seriously if I tell her I have health anxiety. I think that I have PGAD although granted my anxiety does seem to be making it way worse I do have actual symptoms and reason to believe it. I'm actually just kind of hoping it's all in my head but at the same time I'm worried that if I don't get tested and assessed for it it will turn out to be real and not just my anxiety I hate that feeling of uncertainty ,Anxiety
35700,Anyone get nervous about getting the flu when they go to the doctor? Today I had to go to the doctor and a man was sitting near me coughing a lot.

Last time this happen it lasted from July 2018 November 2018 I had numerous tests and numerous Doctors say it was a Viral Infection.It seems to happen every few months I consume a normal amount of Sugar I only drink water I drink about 12 litres a day I walk alot.The Doctors can't figure out the issue posting here just incase someone has had the same issues as me.,Anxiety

I'm going through the anxiety for a long time and got high blood pressure too.My cardiologist said it's all about anxiety what i really feel so.Then went to my psychiatrist to help me out once again and got some medicine named Esita 10 mg and Tanocab 50mg.last 8 months i took the medicine and still on.It made some kind of help like i got no panic attack and blood pressure is quite normal.But problem is when i take the medicine i feel like it's not good for my health and then it creates anxiety again.it kills me anyway.Does anybody help me out?welli'm 26.,Anxiety
35704,Recurring chest pain with no other symptoms Ive had a lot of intense stress the past year and also suffer from an anxiety disorder so it seems to be affecting my body a lot. I went to the ER back in February because my chest hurt and I had a lot of coughing and they did a chest xray and CT scan and monitored my heart rate and everything came back clean for heart issues with reassurance from the radiologist that Im very low risk for heart issues. I was diagnosed with pleurisy which was verified by my regular doctor and got better after a couple weeks. The chest pain has seemed to linger though and my stress has not improved. I have no other symptoms with this chest pain other than anxiety that its something bad. Im afraid to waste more money going to the hospital again since they ran tests that came back clean. Could this be something I need to have checked out again? ,Anxiety
35705,Trigger warning I'm 17 I have MS and I'm worried I also have colon cancer. It's been quite the rough year and I'll admit my HA wasn't as bad as it was after my family got the results from my first MRI test. Sure I googled symptoms all the time especially because one of my enflamed lesions was causing me chronic nausea for more than a month leading me to finally start on my google journey again and begin to go down the rabbit hole of different problems I could possibly have. Until I got double vision I was almost convinced I had esophagus cancer. It was crazy. I googled stuff all the time cried over things I might have worried about it till I fell asleep. But I never really expected the new thing called MS i saw in passing was actually going to end up being me. It was crazy. Every single part. And as you can already expect it's fueling even more even worse anxiety as I try to figure out some current bowel problems that have been plaguing me since my diagnosis last year. Today I made it a job for me to find out what is going on. I've made my way up to taking 290 mg of Linzess a day and still deal with constipation unless I decide to have a fun day out. I always have to go to the bathroom anyway throughout the day whether or not I actually end up going. I started having lower right dull pain halfway into my newfound constipation and was told the linzess would help. It didn't. Then we decided to try more. It helped for a week. I'm vaguely aware or trying to convince myself that drinking more water should help because I'm supposed to with linzess or i risk becoming dehydrated but its been hard to keep up with. TMI but because I'm nervous and desire opinions I must go on. My stools are pale and light a lot of the time. Yellow or white mucus covers some of it and half of it floats half doesn't... Most times I go I bleed a little after and this past time quite a lot. A bright red glop of blood which just didn't seem right for what could've been a hemorrhoid or something else. I usually always feel some kind of discomfort or dull pain in my abdomen across the lower side usually and recently I even had a blood test taken that said my blood count was low. This may be because for MS reasons I'm trying to cut down on red meats and aren't getting enough iron... But it doesn't seem right. At all. All these symptoms line up. down to the anemia. I'm worried beyond compare of anything else before. Nothing from anyone helps because they're just repeating their words before my MRI. I'm scared. I already panicked and cried and called mom and I'm going to tell my neurologist tomorrow to see what she has to offer in guidance. I can only hope I'm not this unlucky... getting two incredibly rare health problems for my age and form and everything else in the same damn year even. I just don't even know where to start at dealing with this.,Anxiety
35706,Hypertensive at 25 amp fear of death Hi all! Having an HA episode today and I don't know how to cope. Went to my psychiatrist this morning where he took my blood pressure. He had to take it about three times the numbers were in the 160110 range. I was very nervous at this appt my first time with a psychiatrist but I've had high BP before at other doctor visits in the past month ie i just got a CPAP machine last month sleep doc said BP might come down with that treatment. and gyno reduced my birth control last month in an attempt to bring it down as well. But today I took my BP again at CVS about 30 mins later and it was still high so I went to urgent care. They said it was probably stress related though I can take other measures to reduce it mostly exercise more lose weight and reduce salt intake. They released me with no meds and an order to monitor it at home for white coat syndrome. Suddenly I'm terrified. I can make those lifestyle changes without issue. But what if they don't help? What if I go into cardiac arrest or stroke before I can lower it? Will exercise make it worse? Will I die in my sleep? Will I have to go on hypertension meds at 25? It runs in my family but this feels like a personal failing my lifestyle and eating habits haven't helped I'm sure. Am I fucked for life? Am I going to die young?Im home now and just took it again 16090. I'm so scared. I have depression and GED which also don't help. I've been stressed out lately but I didn't think it was a huge problem. I feel like I'm just waiting to stroke out or go into extreme chest pain. I feel helpless. ,Anxiety
35707,Eye floaters from stress? Hello I recently went through an eye exam and my eyes checked out healthy enough I have a prescription for nearsightedness but theyve been around for about 3 weeks now and idk if I should be as worried as I am.,Anxiety
35708,Any of you severely nearsighted with anxiety over future eye problems? I am severely myopic which I know is a risk factor for retinal detachment. My mom had a retinal detachment which is when a huge fear kicked in. My number one fear is going blind. I wish I never found out about the risks...I just always went about my life knowing I had bad eyes but its all I ever knew and never had concerns. I cant seem to turn the fear off now seriously making myself ill. Was wondering if anyone else experienced anything like this or is currently! ,Anxiety
35709,Constantly feeling like I'm dying? I've gone to the ER so many times thinking I was dying of a heart attack when it was just terrible anxietypanic attacks. I feel literally every bodily sensation and it puts me into a panic frenzy and makes me feel like it's my last couple of seconds on earth. I cannot handle this anymore. Is there anyway to stop this from happening? I've freaked myself out by feeling my seatbelt and even shirt touch my chest etc. ,Anxiety
35710,Paranoid about food poisoning Never had it. Always terrified of it. Forever burning my chickenavoiding eating it all together so I don't have to even worry about Salmonella killing me every time. If I touch raw chicken or raw chicken touches a surface I've accepted my 100 death. It's easier to just avoid chicken for life. Literally. ,Anxiety
35711,Skin crawlingtickling Ive had this sensation all over my body for the past couple months. I feel it most in my back or legs but have felt it everywhere even on the tip of my nose. Has anyone else had this sensation before? Im so anxious its a neurological issue or something bad.,Anxiety
35712,It finally got the best of me I have suffered with health anxiety over the past year but its been increasingly worse the past few months. This along with the stress I have been under lately has been a disastrous combination. My heart rate has been higher than usual lately along with this weird pain in chest and shoulderobviously leading me to constantly believe Im having a heart attack. Also Ive been somewhat struggling with more intense allergy symptoms. I dont have health insurance so Ive been trying to just ignore it and chalk it up to stress but of course my mind wonders and then I go to google. The past month alone Ive convinced myself that I have various heart issues brain tumors ALS and so many more. So long story short yesterday it got the best of me and I had a panic attack and went to urgent care. The nurse practitioner has pretty much decided its all stress related but decided to do an EKG and a few blood tests anyway. The EKG came back fine and he says by the look of things I seem pretty healthy. Unfortunately the blood test result wont be in until Saturday so thats weighing on me because Im obviously thinking the worst but he prescribed me some anxiety meds and they have helped slightly. But it still sucks to be such a prisoner in my own mind. ,Anxiety
35713,Food went down the wrong hole. Im panicking right now. A few hours ago I was eating a sandwich and I think I swallowed some through my wind pipe. I choked for a few seconds and drank some water and thought I was okay but Im feeling some discomfort in my chest an it feels like something is stuck in my upper chest. I googled and it said that it could get infected or cause pneumonia. I dont know what to do right now,Anxiety
35714,The dread of thinking you have cancer... again My health anxiety has been okay for the last year or so but it's become out of control in the last few days. My poor husband keeps trying to reassure me but I'm struggling to keep myself together Firstly I've had two cold sores in the last month. That's kind of strange as usually I have an outbreak once a year maybe twice.Then about a week ago I developed a really sudden intense pain on the left side underneath my rib towards the back. I've never had a pain like that before and wasn't sure why it was happening. Luckily it went away after a few hours.I've also been waking up a few nights lately sweating a little that always starts alarm bells in my mind but I told myself it's probably because I was due for my periodThen last night I woke up with a really sore throat. I instantly got kind of nervous especially combined with the two cold sores recently. I've felt kinda warm all day but in the last few hours I feel like I'm freezing and think I might be getting a fever which never happens to me during a cold So ofc now I'm freaking out wondering if my immune system is destroyed because of Leukemia or Lymphoma. I'm trying to be calm but it's really difficult atm I'm hoping all this has been influenced by how stressed I've been for the last year but I'm still really scared. Any words of advicesupport would be incredibly appreciated rn. ,Anxiety
35715,Okay I can't live like this. How do I get help? I've had health anxiety since I can remember I was like probably 6 or 7 when I had my first flare up but this last year it is off the charts. I actually have had some health scares and I think it's triggering it beyond belief. I think it's actually causing the aches and pains. I'm at the point where I'm 500 sure I have colon cancer and ALS and cervixovarian cancer and an undiagnosed heart issue. Now my kidneys hurt? So naturally my cancer has spread. It's been like this for a year and my only relief has been when seasonal depression hits.I'm getting married soon. I have a good job. I have lots to look forward to but I'm so so sure I won't be around to see it. I need help and no one takes me seriously. My doctor doesn't understand that this iya ruining my life and keeps giving me meds. With side effects. To someone with health anxiety. I've taken like six different types and none help at all. I can only afford 4 sessions of therapy per year and have found them mostly useless.There has to be something. I can do. I'm so sure I'm going to die and I'm fucking terrified.,Anxiety
35716,Convinced I have MRI contrast dye poisoning weeks after a brain MRI. Need help coping. Using a somewhat new throwaway account sorry if my karma is low. I'm sort of new to the realization that I have HA but it all makes sense now. I've always had anxiety but it's definitely evolved into this about 6 months ago.A few months back I had some strange symptoms that were related to jaw pain. I've pretty much figured out what's wrong there but because of that I've seen a slew of doctors including a neurologist. My doctor ordered a brain MRI with contrast just to be safe. I stupidly googled if the contrast dye can cause adverse reactions in people I strongly suggest you don't google it. Anyway after the MRI I felt nauseated which set my HA into a tailspin. Now a few weeks later I'm noticing that my feet hands and legs suddenly go cold especially when I'm sitting down. I'm talking freezing cold even if the rest of my body is warm. When they finally warm up I get pins and needles all down my legs and today I woke up with muscle spasms in my feet and legs. My scumbag brain is telling me I have some type of weird contrast dye poisoning that isn't curable you know how it goes.My feet getting freezing cold does happen when I'm not in what I would say would be a heightened state of anxiety. It usually sends me into a state of anxiety which I'm sure definitely doesn't help my extremities. It's a real chickenegg scenario.Does this sound like anxiety to anyone or should I actually be concerned? I mean I'm young just turned 30 I exercise about 4 or 5 times a week I eat pretty healthy and am all around healthy. In my mind this should not be happening but here I am. I'm also worried that if I go to the doctor and ask him to test to see if I still have the dye in my system he's going to think I'm crying wolf and won't take me seriously when something else is wrong.I definitely need the sage advice of other HA veterans. I'm new to this and don't know how to tell my brain to stop worrying about it. It won't and I feel out of control like I can't shut it off.,Anxiety
35717,Constant headache how worried should I be? Every day I have some kind of headache. I wake up do my thing go to work and there it is. Some days it comes with nausea. I've been with this for 3 weeks now.Most of the time it's not a full blown migraine. Those I take sumatriptan for and then I lie down and fall asleep for like 9 hoursI'm drinking more water. I do usually have a cup of coffee with cream and sugar in the morning but the headache starts before I have coffee.I do regularly spend a lot of time in front of computer devices. I work on a computer at work and my favorite passtimes are MMOs and other video games.I've got some hot garbage vision but I wear my glasses all the time.The pain.... roams? that's the best way to explain it. It doesn't just sit in one location. Sometimes its behind my eye either eye. Sometimes it's on my temple. Sometimes it's at the back of my head or the top.I have really bad anxiety about actually going to the doctor or the hospital. Hospitals freak me out and I worry that if I go to the doctor they'll send me there. .... I also have a 20 copay for each visit and a 100 copay if I go to the hospital. ,Anxiety
35718,Can you feel your heart beat in your lower back?? This keeps happening and its scary because everything online tells me its an anyuerism and Im going to die. Im 19 average build maybe 160 pounds? And 55. I dont smoke and have no history of this in my family and no heart problems I know of. The pulsing is quite hard and almost feels like someone tapping me in time with my pulse thats how hard it feels. When I have loose fitting clothes I can feel it pulse against that or if Im sat against a leather chair or laying on my back I can feel it sometimes its to the right other times its to the left. I want to go to AampE but my mum wont listen and says its just my anxiety but Ive never had this before. I cant drive so Im just stuck and feel like Im waiting for it to burst suddenly its been like this for a week and is progressively more apparent each day,Anxiety

35722,Been having lots of health anxiety lately about cancer. So I had this hard palate lump behind of my front teeth it's been there for 5 years it grew same time as my 4 wisdome teeth I was wonder could it be a impacted canine? Like a tooth grow inside my hard palate? When I push my upper lip like bellow my nose i can feel it poking out. Although I had blood work done in about 5 months ago my doctors said I'm health i had no cancer and my thyroid are good and other blood related check up are also came out normal,Anxiety
35723,Anyone else? HARD thump from the heart As for a little back story Im 22 and I used to smoke weed all the time. Long story short I got home from work one day about half a year ago smoked what I then considered a normal amount of weed and then was watching videos when I basically had a panic attack racing heart thinking Im going to die the worksThis was especially confusing because of the fact that nothing had changed or differed from my usual schedule. I had no reason to have anxiety over anything and was in a happy place mentally but whatever. Anxiety.It got to the point where I felt that way more and more to the point that I started to feel my heart rhythm go crazy all the time which then led to me visiting a cardiologist. They did every test imaginable and everything came back perfect with the doc lightly suggesting I exercise a little more but its not super necessary. He said it was anxiety related and that I didnt need any meds but prescribed me a blood thinner to take if my heart were to ever go absolutely crazy again. I never did take them and it ultimately got better. I now do think it was me just tripping out in my mind.So fast forward and I have a different issue. During my stint of heart related anxiety one symptom I got towards the end the worst of all was when I would lay down at night or be any bit more tired than usual my heart would THUD extremely hard. It started with the occasional thud by itself and as the days went on it became 2 thuds 3 thuds 4 thuds all about 10 seconds apart from each other increasing in force. It felt as if my heart rhythm would be thrown off and then this thud came out of nowhere and it was SUCH a forceful punch of a feeling that it scared the hell out of me. I was a cigarette smoker at the time and completely stopped. I also stopped drinking even occasionally as these things are known to increase the chance of palpitations. It got to the point where I would even get these thuds when I just woke up and right before I went to sleep and they seemed to be triggered when I laid down or bent over to tie my shoe or whatever the case may be. I considered the fact that my cardiologist said my heart was fine so I just tried not to think about it.It stopped eventually for about 2 months. Now theyre back. In the last 2 weeks this has occurred 3 nights now. Ive also noticed that a flutter thud of the same kind but to a much lesser degree happens when I take a deep breath sometimes not always. Again when Im tired. Im wondering if this is worth another trip to the cardiologist or if this is something others have experienced and gotten past themselves. I dont have health insurance so I dont want to go spend upwards of 1000 dollars to be told theyre benign although they feel like my heart will explode when they happen. Does this sound familiar to anyone?,Anxiety
35724,I dont know what to do This is long Im sorry. Symptoms started in January just feeling off super tired nauseous headaches almost everyday always feel as if Im about to get sick hot throat run down feeling like lymph nodes were swollen etc. At this time I was attempting to recover from binge eating disorder and going through a bout of seasonal depression and my doctor said its the depression making me feel all this. Prescribed me Zoloft which I took for two weeks and stopped because the headaches I got everyday were unimaginable. The feeling of something being off physically never goes away. Start to feel a constant ache in my ears down the side of my neck and under my jaw. I mean literally every second of everyday. Still frequent headaches. Still feel lymph nodes are swollen. Wake up one morning at the end of March and my throat feels worse than it has in 10 years. Go to medexpress and I have strep. I thought maybe thats what its been all this time?! Antibiotics work after a few days on the throat but all other symptoms remain. Between February and March I went to an ENT who basically dismissed me and said I have TMJ looked in my ears which he said looked perfectly healthy. So then I go to my dentist and he took an x ray of my entire head showing all jaw joints which are normal. No sign of grinding. Looked confused when I told him right in the morning when I wake up is when I feel the best then it gets worse throughout the day. Still gave me a mouth guard to wear at night but makes no difference. If I was in constant anxiety over this I would chalk it up to that but Im really not. My CBC diff platelets and all my chemistries were all normal so that helps a lot. Im just so tired of feeling this way. Constant headaches and nausea with a weird achepressuresensation not painful or tender in my ears down my neck under my jaw with pain in my shoulders and the back of my neck sometimes. Some tinges of chest pains here and there. What the heck do I do next? See an allergist? Get a more thorough thyroid battery? Im at a loss and cant stand feeling like this.,Anxiety
35725,Just so scary. So Ive had health anxiety for most of my life. Like over 30 years. I am a nurse. It was easy to go into healthcare because Id spent so much of my life researching different diseases I was sure I had or thought I had a good chance of getting or someone I knew I had. I used to really obsessively research stuff it somehow made me feel better. Anyway. Now Im a nurse. I just finished a 4 day stretch of shifts 14 hours a day no time for meal breaks or any rest at all during work and I only had time to sleep about 6 hours between shifts. So I know rationally that my body and mind are exhausted and that exacerbates the health anxiety. But I woke this morning and every single muscle in my legs and back hurt so bad I can hardly walk. My hands are clammy and cold and sweaty this never happens. I keep swinging between feeling really hot and then getting really chilled. I also have severe emetophobia and Im terrified Im coming down with something. My tummy feels weird like I need to poop but I cant. I cant stand the thought of food. My throat hurts. And all of this is setting off major panic attacks so bad I feel like I cant leave my house. I have a therapy appt in an hour and I really really need to go grocery shopping. Please help. Do you think Im sick? Thanks. ,Anxiety

35728,I have a rabies fear can anyone help out? This all started last June I was playing with my dog in my yard. He lunges forward and I reached out with my hand and his tooth scraped my middle finger. It did cut the skin and I was bleeding. My finger was tingling at the site where he bit me. I went to go wash it off and didnt think much of it until I looked on the fridge and I see my dog was a week overdue on his rabies vaccine. I panicked and wasnt sure what I should do. I know of rabies but I didnt KNOW rabies until my dumb mind did some googling. If you know where the googling is going then you understand my fear. If you dont just dont worry about it. My dog at the time is a 13 year old German Shepherd. He is prone to seizures and would have a couple of them a year. Weve had him for 11 years so we know how to handle the situation. He also drooled and foamed a lot in the mouth. That was his natural way. Hes been vaccinated every year as it is required in the state of New Mexico. I did go to urgent care and received a Tetanus shot since I was overdue on that one but my doctor told me that its been over 40 years since a dog had rabies in my area. so I did not receive the rabies shots. Which made me feel better honestly. For about 5 months. In October my dog was put down because he was struggling to stand up and seemed like he was in pain a lot. In late November I got what seemed like a week long cold. Sore throat tired drained and all that junk. I was sick but not terrible so I went to a concert and I started to feel worse. For some dumb reason the first thing that appeared in my mind was rabies. And I almost panicked because of it and couldnt enjoy the show. I went home after feeling very horrible. I couldnt sleep a headache kicked in my fever rose and its like my mind was repeating the same scene over and over all night long and I couldnt sleep at all. Then I woke up around 5 am with a racing heartbeat that wouldnt slow down at all. I felt awful and was fearful about rabies. Since that day I never ignored my finger where my dog bit me. I still feel pain and a minor tingling sensation where he bit me and all I can think about is if I have rabies. Its practically on a daily basis I look at the spot. I have no idea how to get past this. Its been 9 months since the incident and I still worry about getting it. I just cant shake this fear out of my mind. I thought the spot where he bit me would be gone but the area is still red as if its been only a couple of weeks since hes bitten me. Ive tried everything such as logic. Its exceedingly rare in the US most rabies cases have been from bats in the US or contracted outside. Last person to die from a dog rabies in the US was in 1974. Basically when my parents were still kids. And Im 25 now. My dog survived the 10 day quarantine and we vaccinated him after those 10 days just in case. Like I cant shake the fear. Each time my finger is in pain or even get a tingling sensation my mind instantly jumps to that conclusion. I almost dont care about anything else. I have stomach pains and Im going to see a gastroenterologist about it I really wouldnt care if they told me I had cancer. Rabies is just something that truly sparks fear in my mind. I even freak out seeing bats in the sky since I work at stadiums as a camera guy. ,Anxiety
35729,Scared about Stomach Cancer Ive had some pretty bad abdominal paincramping the last few days that also moves up my chest and feels like heartburn when I lie down. It was so bad today I went to the ER because I was getting pretty nervous. I told my symptoms to the doctor which include pain in my midhigh abdomen more pain when lying down more heartburn at night etc. He told me I had classic symptoms of acid reflux and put me on some Zantac. I just started it today and he gave me a months worth to take until it helps with the Acid Reflux. He also told me that when he checked with his stethoscope that all my bowel sounds were normal and it my digestive track was working fine. I asked him if I needed a CT or if they found anything strange and he said no.But Ive dug myself deep into a hole and Im convinced from all the shit Ive read online that the abdominal pain is from stomach cancer even though I dont show other signs. Can anyone give me some tips on how to deal with this HA? Its getting really bad now and Im sure the stress is probably adding to my paincramps. ,Anxiety
35730,Has Anyone else experienced neck pain right on left side where pulse is? Hi so recently I have been experiencing slight neck pain of the left side of my neck where I feel a pulse.

35731,Circulatory problems. Cause for concern? I'm a very thin dude just under 120 lbs and probably 5'8 or so. I have pretty big hands long gangly fingers and have a friend my age who is 6'5 probably twice my weight who has only slightly bigger hands. Bad circulation is kind of a family thing and my Dad has troubles with it. Every girl I've been with will continually comment on how cold my hands are it ruins some things in that regard for me. Sometimes when I start to get warm again after coming indoors or holding a cold one for a while orange spots begin to appear but my hands rarely warm up to my body's temperature. Should I care now or just worry about getting healthier overall? ,Anxiety

35733,Kidney infection? Im a 36yo female.A few weeks ago I recognized a UTI coming on. I did what we all do and started drinking a ton of water and taking my cranberryprobiotic capsules. By chance my annual gyno exam was like two days after it started. Even though my symptoms had started to get better with still occasional pain with urination I asked them about it. They said they didnt see anything but I begged and she begrudgingly gave me 3 days worth of antibiotics. Then I started getting back pain.. but this is normal for me I have back problems. It was across my lower back so didnt seem to be specifically over my kidneys. It got pretty bad and I went to urgent care where they did another urine which was clear again possibly because of the super short dose of antibiotics the week prior they gave me muscle relaxants and sent me on my way. The NEXT week this week the pain started to intensify. It started keeping me up at night and was definitely over where my right kidney should be. Back to urgent care. They said I had blood etc in my itinerary this time. Did a CT scan but didnt see stones. Gave me fluids and pain meds and a script for keflex and sent me on my way. I got about two doses under my belt and woke up yesterday morning with excruciating pain that now radiated to my abdomen as well. I was getting cold chills and nausea. I headed for the ER. They ran a gamut of tests on me and concluded that its a raging kidney infection. They admitted me and Ive been on IV pain meds and antibiotics. My white cell count which was pretty high is normalizing. No more chills or nausea. My question is why isnt my pain going away? When the meds wear off its still excruciating! Im a realist.. I know theres still going to be SOME pain.. Ive been in the hospital for two days though and it ruts almost exclusively in my abdomen now. The nurse cant seem to explain it to me and I wont see the doctor until the morning. Im concerned that this is something more nefarious than a kidney infection but Im wondering if anyone has had an experience like this or has any input at all really that might help. Thank you so much in advance! ,Anxiety
35734,Thanks Ancestry Hi guys!So i recently took an Ancestry DNA test and I bought access to the records. My maternal grandmother apparently died of Uterine Cancer at 40 years old. My grandmother was always told it was lung cancer. She thought it made sense since her mother was a very heavy tobacco smoker. Anywho now Im constantly worried about this. I also have PCOS that makes me have irregular periods. Just crappy thoughts and i hate this! Ive had health anxiety in the past. Luckily I have my therapist appointment on Monday so Ill talk to him about this new fact. Thanks for listening. ,Anxiety
35735,Very scared about joint pain have had health anxiety for months Hi all I'm 20 years old and since November I have been suffering from health anxiety. I have always has mild anxiety but it never got in the way of me living my life. Now though everyday all I can think about is my health and the symptoms I have. In the past four months I have thought I have breast cancer lung cancer gallstones stomach ulcers peripheral artery disease peripheral neuropathy etc. The list goes on. I have been to the doctors so many times. As soon as I'm not worrying about one symptom anymore a new one shows up. For the past month I have had strange feelings in my legs random numbness and shooting pains. My feet also get red and burn when I stand for too long. My doc diagnosed me with venous insufficiency but I couldn't stop worrying it was something else. I started noticing that a lot of the time the pain is in my joints. Since then almost 247 I have some pain in my joints ranging from mild to very painful. Yesterday I even started feeling pain in my TM joint. I am convinced I have rheumatoid arthritis because I also have lack of appetite and low iron. I emailed my doctor about this Tuesday and she hasn't gotten back to me and I am so worried I am thinking I'm going to go to an urgent care. I have also read that joint pain can result from anxiety which I try to convince myself that that is what is happening to me but I am still so worried.My mom is trying to convince me that I am fine but she doesn't know that for sure. I am literally on the verge of tears almost all of the time and cry almost daily. I can't focus on schoolwork because my mind always drifts back to the pain. I am so tired of living like this and not being able to tell if my symptoms are a result from anxiety or from a disease. I just want to go back to how I was before.Has anyone here experienced something similar? Should I go to an urgent care just in case? ,Anxiety

35737,I Love you ALL! Last year March I experienced my first panic attack followed by a few more which led me to a spiral of anxiety and health anxiety which I didnt even know was a thing till recently.

After searching this thread and reading everyones posts has given me a lot of hope and cant thank everyone enough for contributing their experiences and how theyve managed or beat their anxieties.Battling this awful feeling has made me appreciate everything in life a whole lot more and to love A LOT More.

35738,what should be the Best time of my life is being absolutely destroyed by ALS fears I dont know what to do. I have had twitching muscles in specific areas decreasing and feelings of weakness marked by certain muscles seemingly taking over for the ones that are lost such as when i walk ect. for over three years this has been an issue that i have had to ensure myself that it's nothing and was able to ignore it blissfully for the most part especially last year in an exciting freshman year of college. But then back in august i met an amazing girl and suddenly everything came crashing down. My future was important to ensure for myself so I started paying more attention to my body for reassurance. And boom. The issue was not gone and I knew it. It was worse in fact. It had spread. The next three months were nothing short of hell. I lost myself. No sense of self. Life itself felt super meaningless and artificial. I thought about death daily. How to kill myself in the least horrible way if i got the diagnosis. My faith was depleted. It felt like I actually died inside. And all this at the time that should have been THE BEST of my life aka honeymoon phase of a new exciting relationship. It effected us negatively obviously. Thank God in december I somehow felt like i came back to life. I can only credit God for answering my distressed desperate prayers the entire month prior. I was able to focus on my life and my relationship in Jan Feb and march which were all GREAT with these health worries still present but always able to be beaten. But today i find myself in a situation trying to schedule an appointment for an EMG in order to finally out this away after getting dismissed without a checkup back in october. im scheduled for june to get checked and HOPEFULLY sent to an EMG. I just cant let this ruin my life anymore. I need to know. This is the loneliest feeling ever. My body has something going on. I just need to know.,Anxiety

35740,Suddenly Developed Health Anxiety Greetings RedditorsThis is my first post ever on this website honestly the first blog that I could think of to go to and I really need some advice. Im a 21 year old Male.When I turned 21 in September I developed a severe drinking habit. I would drink every night to black out. This continued from September through January. After January first I decided to quit cold turkey which I believe caused my body a great deal of stress. When I was detoxing I began to google my symptoms. This was my first obsession with my health. I settled on having Diabetes. It all added up in my head the light headedness tingling in my feet and hands and lots of sweating. I went to the doctor after 2 to 3 days of intense worry to find out I was perfectly healthy with near perfect cholesterol sugar iron etc levels.In around mid February I came to the conclusion that this is an anxiety disorder.I was talking to someone on FaceTime and laughed really hard at what they said. While I was laughing I feltheard a click in my head probably just my jaw and immediately thought I had had a brain aneurysm. I then for the next three or four days was having terrible what I know now panic attacks.This transitioned into me believing that my panic attacks were Heart attacks and the slurred speech I got when I was coming out of the attack to be me having a Stroke despite not ever displaying symptoms of Stroke Heart Attack Aneurysm etc. The attacks would be so bad that I would for days feel like I was walking around in a dream a buzzing feeling in my head strong sensitivity to light and sound. I just felt like complete shit always. This was often paired up with severe tension headaches and the sensation of cold water being poured on my head always the right side which further worried me thought I was having strokesEvery single day since that day it has been something else. Ive convinced myself that I am anemic diabetic having liver failure having appendicitis having eye cancer tonsil cancer bone cancer. You name it I've probably convinced myself of it.Currently I am struggling with a bump behind my right molar. This is on the side of the gum line and more than 100 sure it is a wisdom tooth coming in completely sideways as I am that age. However my sympathetic nervous system decided to force me to believe that it was a tumor and that I was going to die. This caused me to have probably close to a dozen panic attacks over the course of around 3 hours. Each one lasting anywhere from a few minutes to 2030. Hyperventilation racing heart sharp chest pain feeling of impending doom sweating and aggressive crying.Before I quit drinking I never worried about anything. I could handle an extreme workload without even the slightest repercussion. And now seemingly every single day its a new worry that makes it so that I just want to fucking die. Ive never seen a Doctor for the disorder just to have them check up on the symptoms that I think I'm experiencing.My main question is has this happened to anyone before? Like an anxiety disorder developing seemingly overnight the course of a few days? Or is this extremely abnormal.At this point Im just really really scared and want to start to feel normal again. I don't know what to do..,Anxiety

35742,I'm getting a colonoscopy and I'm freaking terrified I've had minor GI bleeding for a while that warrants a colonoscopy. I want to do it because at the very least it'll give me a peace of mind but it's the biggest procedure I've had so far in my life and the first time I'll be under sedation so I'm absolutely freaking out. I'm 25 people my age don't usually go under colonoscopies so it's kind of hard to talk about this with others. Even the prep alone sounds awful thanks to all the horror stories. I know it's a routine procedure for folks way older than me but I'm still pretty scared. Has anyone here gotten a colonoscopy at a young age? One of the things that concerns me is that I've heard people who have IBS have worse symptoms after the procedure likely due to the prep.,Anxiety
35743,Skin cancer fears Skin cancer is a specific fear of mine because of a few awful burns I've had in the past. I'm pale so I burn incredibly easily. I am 100 convinced I am going to get skin cancer eventually.There's a small bump on the back of my head no bigger than the tip of my thumb. I can't see it but apparently it's pink. You know when you get a bump on your head from hitting it and there's sort of a dull pain when pressure is applied to it? That's how it feels when I press on the bump that's on the back of my head. It's hard you can't really press down on it.As I type this I'm pretty anxious because I'm convinced whatever the bump on my head is is going to kill me. There are so many different ways skin cancer can look and I'm scared that's what I have. I don't remember hitting my head on anything recently and even if I did I've never had a bump form that was that small before.,Anxiety

Ive had a lot going on since October last year and tried to seek answers from health professionals I say that so lightly and people on Reddit for advice. Ive had loads of symptoms since January that you can get with various stages of cervical cancer but I dont know if its based on basic stuff. Ive had around 5 blood tests stool samples ultrasounds of my ovaries in that time and two unsuccessful smear exams. Im super scared but apparently any changes could be picked up in bloodwork Ive been told by a semi professional my bfs mum is a GP so I try to ask him to get her opinions etc. Im so scared and keep googling cervical cancer and the signs.

35755,Dizziness pressure in head headaches strange seizurelike episodes brain tumor or sinus infection? Hey all. I'm making a doctor's appointment first thing in the moring but I'd like some advice on what I am experiencing in the meantime. For a couple months I have been getting these strange episodes that I can only describe as pseudoseizures. One of the most notable symptoms is that I suddenly have this overwhelming sensation of physical buildup like you get right before a good sneeze or before you start crying. However that release doesn't come so I get urges to make noise like moaning or screaming to force the feeling out. Another big symptom is a sudden inability or difficulty in swallowing. It's like I've forgotten how to move my tongue properly or like my mouth is too dry and I can only partially swallow. I have to push food to the back of my throat so that it's already partially down and then struggle to get it the rest of the way. I stop eating when this happens because I don't want to risk choking. Other symptoms are a tightness in the back of my head confusion and sometimes waves of tingles or energy washing over my scalp. The waves are very brief but will repeat over and over for up to 20 minutes. When they stop the rest of the symptoms go away too. I havent gotten too many of these the past couple weeks but they were nearly constant a month ago.For the past couple weeks I have been having sporadic dizzy spells that feel like my body is floating or like my brain is swimming around in my head. Sometimes I get queasy during these spells. I noticed that they seemed to come or be worsened when looking at screens like my phone or computer so I eventually figured it must be cybersickness. I am using my devices less and more carefully and the dizzy spells got better for a few days.However now I am having very uncomfortable pressure in my head that seems to move around. It is mainly in my temples and the back of my head but sometimes I can feel it in my nose too. It ranges from being annoying to feeling like my head has been put in a gentle hydraulic press. I feel dizzy when the pressure worsens.Every so often my right hand will feel slightly numb and it feels like I've lost some fine motor control in it. However it's hard to tell if that is real or is just anxiety. It could also be carpal tunnel because I am an artist and it's in the hand I use to do most everything. It usually goes away in a few minutes to an hour.I have been dealing with issues with my eyeglass prescription for the past few months. My old prescription had run its course and had started giving me trouble so I went and got a new one a few weeks ago but it's too strong so I'm getting them bumped down a bit now.Here are my crazy concerns brain tumor adultonset hydrocephalus brain cancer cancer is of least concern because I recently had bloodwork and it came back perfect so I shouldn't have thatMy more realisic theories are sinus issues like infection or irritation anxiety eye strain from not wearing my glasses and having an outdatedoverpowered prescription.I was getting my prescription rewritten today and my eye doctor looked at my eyes to see if he could find any sign of a tumor and he said everything looked good to him but I'm still worried.What are all your thoughts? Do you think those strange episodes are really seizures? Should I be worried I have a tumor?,Anxiety

35766,Started CBT therapy a few weeks ago Hi guys I started my course of CBT a few weeks back and one of the first steps my therapist has told me to take is to completely stop the excessive checking I do whether that be prodding for lumps if I feel a pain or taking tonnes of pictures of moles thinking theyve changed etc. The therapist was saying that there isnt really a magic formula to stop the checking you just have to do it cold turkey.I feel I have reduced it a fair bit since starting as I realised a lot of it was mindless but stuff like the checking of moles is still keeping me from stopping has anyone got any tips?Thanks,Anxiety
35767,Urinalysis came back weird and Im freaking out 24F I just went for my routine checkup with the doctor and had a blood and urine test. The blood test came back fine for everything but the urine test came back with elevated leukocyte erasure wbc bacteria and squamous epithelial cells. I doctor googled myself into a panic about cancerkidneyliver disease even though it seems very likely its a UTI. The only thing is... I have no symptoms of a UTI. Could this be dehydration? I definitely dont drink as much water as I should but the day I took the test I drank a lot since I knew Id have to take a urine test. Could it be an asymptomatic UTI? If so is there any chance I caused kidney damage by not catching it earlier? Possibly relevant I also have a sinus infectioncold right now. The doctor hasnt called yet to explain the results just got them this morning. I guess I just need talking down.,Anxiety
35768,Anxiety Brain Eating Amoeba Ive had health anxiety for about 8 months now Ive always wanted to post here but have always been too sacred. For me everything started with a scan my wife had and in the wait I started searching for possible causes and then started getting her symptoms. At first it was pancreatic cancer then lun cancer the stomach cancer etc. I have gotten help and have actually been partially hospitalized for my anxiety. For my regular health got an abdominal ultrasound and all clear. At about he 6 month mark I started eating persistent headaches and thats when thins got really bad. At that point I was convinced I was dying so I went to my Dr and told her about the headaches. Although I suffer from migraines and have had bouts of persistent headaches in the past she recommended a sinus x ray and a head mri just to be clear and so I could calm down. Although the mri is this coming Wednesday I have been relatively stable for about 3 weeks until yesterday that is. Yesterday I was cleaning out my lawnmower and accidentally got a little bit of carburetor cleaner in my forehead. In order to make the sting go away I went to the hose and but some water in my forehead however some water went into my nose and now I cant stop thinking about the brain eating amoeba. I live in PR so weather here is warm and I really cant function right now due to fear of the brain eating amoeba. Any advice would be appreciated. Tl DR Was doing good with nmy health anxiety until I accidentally got tap water up my nose. ,Anxiety

35774,Reinforcing Anxiety by going to the doctor Recently I have been thinking about whether or not I should go to the doctor for the bigger problems I can't seem to shake. I was told a while back I had a lesion in my leg that was most likely benign and then that was it. I didn't hear anything back from any doctor about it and I didn't know where to go or what to do about it and my HA went through the roof because of it. I recently went to my main doctor and asked him about it. He told me they can't legally say 100 something is benign because they can be sued over it but reallistically it most likely was benign. He said that I could always get an xray if I needed reassurance to make sure it hasn't changed ar all. My question is this what do you guys think you would do in my position? I have had enough radiation in my body already and I want to avoid it as much as possible. And I feel like maybe not going and getting the xray can teach me more skills that I need to cope. I know something is there but I still have to live my life. And trust in my faith of God.I appreciate any advice.,Anxiety

35782,I don't wanna eat Trigger Warning I do not know if this is the right subreddit for this if its not then please redirect me to a proper subreddit.I do not think know if this counts as an eating disorder or not. I think about not eating sometimes although I have not acted upon it. The reason why I don't want to eat is because of my periods. If I don't eat I will not get my period. I have really bad anxiety when it comes to menstruation. This post I made explains why.httpswww.reddit.comrmenstruationcommentsaf32dwiwannatalkaboutmenophobiamystoryMy period is the main cause of my anxiety. I'm tired of being ashamed and embarrassed about this. I'm tired of being not like everyone else. I just don't want to put up this anymore. I'd like to add that I haven't started to starve myself these are just intrusive thoughts. Although I kinda want to stop eating.I'm not calling this an eating disorder is because it has nothing to do weight or body image. As you can see this is very complicated. If I do stop eating I'll take everything into consideration.The only way for me to be happy is without my period. I'll eat when I don't have my period that month or whatever.I want to try to conquer my fear of sexmenstruation. But I know I can't do it. People on Reddit say that I should try to learn about what's going on in body so that I won't be afraid. I definitely can't do that. I'm a loser because of this.I blame myself a lot for being this fear. Its all my fault. I hit myself from time to time because I feel so stupid. I have not told my family that I think about not eating anything. I feel too guilty to tell someone. People already don't understand why I feel uncomfortable about sexuality and menstruation. Life sucks.Again if this isn't the place for this let me know.,Anxiety

35784,How do you cope with bad stool anxiety? Gross? I've been struggling with this particular health anxiety for some months now.I've been suffering heavily from health anxiety for 9 months now. But this isn't some muscle ache or dizziness I can just ignore.The stool keeps going from having weeks where it's too soft to weeks where it's semi back to normal. Sometimes I see small red...bits? in it. When I went to my doctor about it the first time I performed a couple of feces tests. I got a slightly elevated white blood cell count on one of them.Then like 2 months ago I cried hysterically because I started dripping fresh red blood after a visit. Doctor discovered that there was a small hemorroid near the opening. I've done more tests much later on so far they've come out negative I have one more test I need to do that is quite time consuming. He assured me that it's way too rare that it can be colon cancer I'm 20 and have no history and that he sees no real reason to worry.But I'm relapsing again two weeks after feeling fine about it. I got a very small amount of blood. I know it's much more likely that it was a tear cause it hurt quite a bit coming out. But it awakened the beast from it's slumber...I just don't know how to ignore stuff like this and carry on. It's not like a muscle pain which can be anything and ignored. It's too visual and clear to my eyes.TLDR How do you deal with a visual symptom like finding something bad in your feces?,Anxiety
35785,Recent onset of HA Trying to nip it in the bud Hi all.Back in November I had a rather large health scare. I had a real symptom that I was dealing with for 2 years I thought it was just something simple so I kept putting it off. I never had HA before and was so laid back I let this issue go on for 2 years.Finally saw a doc about it and immediately was ordered a CT scan. I got afraid it was serious. Went in for the scan and had to wait 12 days to get the results back since it was over Thanksgiving. I was... not myself these days. Pretty much mortified as I was finally coming to terms with my mortality wishing I went earlier etc...Thankfully to SO MUCH RELIEF the scans came back clean. The issue I had was very real however. Docs knocked it up to a really bad cold I had that did some damage on my body. Annoying but manageable. Thankfully not the big C or a brain tumor. I am healthy.Since then however I've been shook. It's been some time now but since I've had more HA than I ever had before. My family line is healthy I'm relatively healthy etc. However I've been over analyzing myself and have thus far 'induced' two issues. The main one being overnoticing my eye floaters and oddities I had my whole life that I literally never had before. Eye things seem to be the big thing right now with me I don't know. I DON'T have visual snow but am afraid if I think about it too much I might get it. I have an eye exam scheduled soon. I was due for a standard one anyway but I don't know why my mind is in 'something is wrong with your eye' mode when my eyes have been like this my whole life And I have had many normal exams.I really want to nip this in the bud before it gets too bad. I think it's still 'young' and I can overcome it and beat it before it consumes my life. I need to. I'm looking for self help methods right now. Guides meditations even books. Please do not suggest therapy at this time. It is something I may consider in the future but I am not in the right place or mindset for it right now Had a traumatic experience with it in the past. I need therapy for my therapy. Ha. But any advice on selfhelp that I can do right now would be really appreciated. I've been listening to positive affirmations on youtube which has helped a lot. I think I can get over this I just need direction.Thank you so much.,Anxiety
35786,lived in Vermont apartment for over a year possibly with dangerous radon levels I'm a 28yearold male reasonably fit moved to Montpelier VT over a year ago. Yesterday at work I overheard two women talking about a tunnel that was cordoned off due to dangerously high radon levels. I did some research and apparently Montpelier is a death zone with abnormally high levels all across with the average being a whopping 3.4.I'm an introvert and spend a lot of time indoors horribly afraid of cancer and now I'm convinced I'm going to develop lung cancer. Haven't had the radon levels in my apartment checked and I can't afford a contractor to do the job right. I heard the free test kits require around nine months to get an accurate reading and I refuse to wait that long and potentially jeopardizing my health. I have a shitload of work to do and I can't concentrate. I don't feel safe in my house anymore. Is one year of exposure to potentially elevated radon levels enough to develop lung cancer?,Anxiety

35788,Heres my story LONG Hey Ive been suffering from health anxiety for years now 46yrs. Im 18 now. It all started with me having a tight throat feeling which I have because of GERD I didnt know at that time and I searched it up on google and all my symptoms matched thyroid cancer etc. I got panic attacks laying in bed for hours searching on google at age 13. It became so bad that I never went outside. I used to either tell my friends Im sick or just talk to them over the phone to something. 2014 is when I developed my first real disease called Visual Snow symptoms are where you are tiny dots over your vision like pixels. Luckily Ive managed to ignore that and accepted it as a part of me. At age 16 I dropped out of high school because I was unable to wake up in the morning and get ready. Since I dropped out of high school I developed BDD Body Dysmorphia. It became so bad that I never went out in daylight. I checked the mirrors every 30 minutes hated my face etc. Now Im 18 and have noticed 4 months ago that my tongue twitches in the mirror fasciculations. I even read ALS patients never feel their twitches in the tongue. Just like me. At this point I take it as it is. My life will just be anxiety diseases problems etc.,Anxiety

35793,Neti Pot Anxiety I was recently diagnosed with a sinus infection and told to use a Neti Pot. Being careful to read the directions I took off the nasal cap and washed it with soap and my bathroom sink water then poured distilled water over it to rinse. However as usual my anxiety about this kind of stuff has flared up wondering if the hand soap I used was not appropriate if I poured enough tap water to rinse that soap off and then if I poured enough tap water off with distilled water. As I looked things up I became even more scared reading that tap water with Neti Pots can be dangerous. I haven't touched the thing since and my sinus headaches are becoming increasingly easier for my anxious mind to read as some kind of horrible brain amoeba like you can find stories on.Any advice on how I can put myself at ease instead of feeling like I will be waiting the next couple of months before I know if I have gotten a more serious infection?

35794,Should I be worried about a possible auditory hallucination? Hi guysToday I was on a empty street waiting for my Uber when I heard a baby cry for about a few seconds twice. I did not hear this sound again and it sounded like it came from one of my houses as some of the houses had their lights on. I did not see the baby though and I have not heard this sound again. I am worried this might be the onset of Schizophrenia yet my psychiatrist said I do not have any of the positivenegative symptoms. Does Schizophrenia develop that rapidly or suddenly or is it more gradual. I did not hear anything throughout the day so naturally this has me worried.

35795,HA and a Palm Tree lead me to urgent care To preface I just discovered this sub and WOW I cant believe theres so many others who struggle with the same issues I do. Ive struggled with HA since I was about 14 Im 24 now and I go through periods of time where Im fine and then Ill hit a rough couple of weeks that leave me absolutely crippled. So couple of weeks ago after many years of worry I am a former smoker I finally got the reassurance that I did not have lung cancer due to shortness of breath. Following that positive news I thought to myself okay great finally my HA will calm down. That was short lived. A couple of days ago I was attempting to clean palm tree debris and got stuck by a leafthorn. Naturally it lead me to google it because it got slightly swollen and I convinced myself I had a serious infection and Plant Thorn Arthritis Thanks Google So off to the urgent care I went they laughed at me when I demanded a Tetnus shot and gave me antibiotics and sent me on my way. I still cant stop thinking about how I might have to get surgery to remove plant debris its been consuming every thought of mine even though the swelling has gone down. In other news Ive had a slight tenderness in my thigh for a few months and my googling has lead me to believe I have a DVT. Im freaking out and scheduled another doctors appointment for Monday.... I luckily have a very supportive SO that recognizes when Im on my bad weeks with HA and is my safe person. It just sucks so much we have so much planned the next few weeks and all I can focus on is my impending death. But hey Im so happy I found this community and Im looking into getting professional help for my HA and trying to figure out better ways to handle it.,Anxiety

There are many 'problems' I have that I don't really worry about anymore. yay.In exchange I am now worrying about the health of others like crazy. Some people in my life either have or died to cancer and right now I only have my mother left of my family. Not a day goes by where I am not building up a scenario in my head where she will die soon. It doesn't help that she is the type of person to never see a doctor so I spend every waking moment trying to find a way to make her get her appointments.The thing is I really want to stop somedays I tell myself how unlikely all of this is even looking up global statistics and that I should just stop and go on.But then it's my fault if she dies.

35797,Love Yourself Good morning Reddit users! I wanted to pass some words or love and support.We are all here because of our health anxiety whether we have it now or we had it in the past and were just trying to support others.I wanted to tell everyone...Breathe.Why is that so important? Because when we are all trapped inside our own thoughts and obsessed with our problems we feed into our pain our stress and our anxiety. Thats what our anxiety wants! Take a moment to step back and relax let your body unravel since its so tense you wont even notice it! Close your eyes take deep breaths just to let your mind go back to normal. Because if you continue to worry and stress your symptoms of whatever youre feeling get worse! Then you begin to analyze new symptoms and youll start to worry about those. So just breathe please.We as human beings sometimes forget to love ourselves and appreciate the small steps we take against our anxiety! Please give yourself a pat on the back congratulate yourself for taking this small step! Dont ever feel like youre alone were all here to help each other because we want the best for each other we might feel like were in a hole. But we can get out of here I promise you all we just need the support and the love because with that we can counter attack the mind. Its powerful but we cant let it take advantage of us! We gotta control it and use it to our advantage! I hope all you have a wonderful day and week and month and year. Let this be our year! Lets tackle this together!I love you all. Lets beat this together. ,Anxiety

35804,An Arrow To The Knee Hello everyone! Recently I have been going through a bout of health anxiety due to a nasty head cold. Lots of dizziness and headaches have been fueling my worries making me feel very disconnected and depressed. I have been constantly worrying that this will never end or that something more serious is going on.Earlier today I was starting to have a bit of a panicanxiety attack so I decided to go for a drive and clear my head while listening to some music. I ended up driving to a park watching the sun set and taking a walk which really helped me regain focus on reality and calm down. Luckily on my evening stroll I found a fence with some graffiti reading Let It Be which reminded me of a lesson my old therapist gave me. I think it could help a lot of people on this sub.She used to compare any condition or small symptom causing worry to being hit with an arrow. cue Skyrim guard life story Going ahead and excessively worrying about the first arrow to the extent that many of us do is like shooting yourself with another arrow. I am already suffering from a sinus infection why would I then exacerbate my anxiety by worrying about it more than I should? This could extend to anything we worry about a headache a sore stomach etc. Dont let a small insignificant symptom we are dealing with create more issues just let it be and it will pass. That headache you think is brain cancer will go away! That leg twitch you think is early signs of ALS will go away! Dont take an arrow to the knee from life and shoot yourself with another. I hope this helps some peoples worries!,Anxiety
35805,Looking for some advice I just know how ridiculous this is going to sound and I would like to apologize in advance for that.ampx200BEver since Rachel Star Withers' face was eaten away by flesheating bacteria I have been living under the constant fear that I might end up with the same fate as hers. I know how rare necrotizing fasciitis is 0.0004 but I just can't seem to get my mind off it. I have because of this become a germaphobe and was compelled to wash my hands with soap after picking up anything from a surface that I consider just a bit unclean. As a result my overly dry hands are now cracking and it's creating small tiny wounds on my skin which only made the situation worse cause necrotizing fasciitis usually occurs with certain types of bacteria entering wounds on one's skin. I understand that the best thing to do right now is to stay away from this irrational hand washing habit of mine but I simply can't do it. To make things worse I always feel like I have touched something dirty when in reality I haven't. For instance when I walk pass a trash can a bit too close I feel really uncomfortable and go straight to the bathroom to wash my hands. I only came close to touching it but my mind is telling me that I have indeed already touched it.ampx200BI have been going through hypochondria for quite some time but now I really feel like I'm going crazy. Has anybody ever experienced this? Can some of you please give me some advice on this. From how to deal with the flesheating bacteria craze to how to stop being a germaphobe. It can be anything. I just want all this to stop.ampx200BIs there anything that I can do,Anxiety

35807,My fingernails are giving me so much anxiety!!! I have not been this anxious for so long. I've dealt with health anxiety in the past about many different things that seem so much more serious and like more confronting for me like stroke and heart disease since those are two things that have been in my family. But within the past two weeks I have been incredibly anxious about my fingernails because my two thumb nails have ridges in them almost like lumps. Of course I googled I know I shouldn't. I did though and it was filled with kidney disease and all these terrible things and now I am unbelievably anxious. My therapist cut us back from weekly to fortnightly visits and now to monthly and my appointment got delayed for another two weeks even though it's been a whole month. I don't feel like I want to share this anxiety to him because I am embarrassed. I feel silly that I am so anxious and paranoid about my fingernails but the reality is that I can't stop thinking about it even when I'm not directly thinking about it. I'm constantly checking google to see if I can find something that maybe says it's ok and it's nothing to worry about but I can't and it's making it worse. Ahhh,Anxiety

Had a lot of drinks 20 yesterday over the course of the whole day and woke up feeling awful. I finally threw up less than an hour ago but there was some blood in it. Now I think Im going to die and just need a rational perspective to help calm me down.

Now Im scared I have multiple sclerosis cause my legs feel really heavy and my vision is wonky,Anxiety
35813,Woo! Heart Woes. Ive been dealing with bad heart palpitations since I was about 12 years old my parents always told me it was anxiety attacks as they run in the family.In early February I had a bad anxiety attack with palpitations which triggered about a 3 week period of time where my heart was just fluttering constantly while I was laying in bed trying to sleep doing nothing etc... I seriously felt like I was going to die which then triggered a super intense depression like Id never felt in my life. I finally gave in and went into Urgent Care once I had enough where the doctor did an EKG and measured my resting heart rate at about 136 bpm. They urged me to go to emergency so I did and 1000 later they told me I was totally fine my heart likes to jump around a lot but palpitations are normal and they recommended I start meditating. I dont doubt the constant fluttering was probably due to health anxiety since I felt so scared from it. I took their advice started meditating got a breathing app and decided to find a heart rate app to measure my bpm when it happens since Im never able to get into emergency when the palpitations are actually happening. Its been giving me a little peace of mind to see whats going on when I feel them and sometimes its not so bad as I feel like it is my heart rate is usually 90110 bpm seems okay enough. It also helps me just to have a visual of whats going on. Anyway after a couple more weeks of meditating drinking lots of water and pulling myself out of my funk I seemed alright again and convinced myself its all in my head.Today I was shopping bent over to pick something up and it triggered really intense palpitations. My heart was pounding so hard that my entire body was shaking. I kept trying to calm down but had no luck I remembered the heart rate app and pulled it out to see the severity of the situation. The app couldnt even measure it for a minute I watched the lines squiggling all over the place extremely tiny and just bouncing everywhere. Finally got a reading of 210 bpm and so I sat and tried to calm down some more and it finally slowed to about 160bpm then about 10 minutes later I was back in the low 100s range. Now its been a couple hours and Im comfortable in the 90s. Im super tired now but I feel like I handled it like a champ this time. Its weird to experience a feeling like your heart is going to blow up but to have doctors tell you youre fine. What a fun time Anyway my sister says she knows of a cardiologist Im going to see if theyre accepting patients. I doubt Ill get in anytime soon since all the doctors in my area are booked out for months but it is what it is I guess. Reading posts on this page and how other people deal with it has really helped me through all of this so thank you everyone whos shared their heart related stories! I dont feel like theres any advice I havent tried yet but I still wanted to share my experience and get it off my chest!,Anxiety

35817,How to give more power to positive thoughts automatic negative thoughts causing panic attacks I have been suffering from constant automatic irrational negative thoughts for 7 months now. I have had a checkup on every part of my body including 3 heart checkups I am literally completely fine. Im a healthy young adult that used to go gym a lot. Since my anxiety has heightened Ive stopped going gym in the fear of something happening and I get regular panic attacks. I feel like Ive been getting better each month but currently my senses are heightened a lot to whats happening in my stomach and back. Any new sensation it causes me to panicworrry and bring those thoughts in which makes no rational sense. However when I am anxious now I am really forcing myself to say positive things such as no I am fine I am safe Ive been through this e.t.c. But its the constant negative irrational thoughts mainly about negative heart connotations or that this person will have to save me or if I go to this place something will happen that constantly pop up and making me excessively panic. I have practiced meditation for a few days now and Im listening to positive affirmations everydaySo theres two stages left of my anxiety now that I need to get rid of.extra heightened sense of awareness for any feeling in my stomach or backI suffer from heartburn and GERD so there are constant sensations. I have been trying to focus on different parts of my bodyhow can I give more power to my positive thoughts which should lead me to be more excited rather than constantly in state of panic due to these automatic negative thoughtsSo can anyone help? Every day has pretty much been a struggle in this period Im a college student so Ive fallen behind in my work so much. Annoying thing is I have so many Entrepreneurial goals but in this period I have only lost money and not had any chance to gain so now Im broke and unable to try anything,Anxiety
35818,Having a severe panic attack might be triggering As of today I've suddenly begun experiencing a sweet taste in my mouth. I'm a long time sufferer of health anxiety and intrusive thoughts compelled me to start selfdiagnosing what the issue could be. While my family has no history of Diabetes and I eat well I saw that it could be an early symptom for type 2 diabetes. Since I've seen that I've convinced myself that that's exactly what it is and that my life is over. I'll just have to live with a future of crippling health issues from here on out. I can't get it out of my mind and the fear of that is overwhelming me. I'm hyperventilating and I don't know what I can do to put my mind at ease. I know it's probably nothing in reality but this idea claws at the back of my mind going What's wrong with looking out for your health? It's better to catch these things early and it compels me to look further into it which further perpetuates the cycle. I'm so tired and scared and I don't know what to do.EDIT Since I've now read that additional symptoms are excessive drinking and bathroom visits I'm obsessing over that and am afraid to do either.,Anxiety
35819,Please tell me if its something serious Two months ago I went through a bout of a bad common cold and it was gone late February. In March I was definitely fine. In April however I began to have runny nose coughing with phlegm on the first day but now its dry without a sore throat.

35823,Severe Hypochondria after Being on Accutane Hey everyone. Most of my life I have never thought twice about a physical symptom and was confident in my health. However that changed when I went on Accutane to help my cystic acne in August 2018. I started experiencing physical symptoms such as an increased resting heart rate all the time around 100 or more bpm when it used to be around 75 stomach issues like indigestion and weird bubblinggurgling coming up my throat and noises in my stomach when I sucked it in and out which I later researched and believe is succussion splash. I was feeling very anxious about how my body was feeling and felt like I was changing like I wasn't the same person. I know Accutane is associated with horror stories so that just fueled my anxiety. I stopped the medicine at only 2.5 months instead of completing the full course which was supposed to be 6 months. I was so concerned about my symptoms that I went to three doctors got an EKG echocardiogram different blood tests and capsule endoscopy. Doctors said everything was normal. Cardiologist agrees that my pulse was a little higher than normal but still in the normal range and that it's nothing to be worried about diagnosed it as inappropriate sinus tachycardia I haven't been able to do things normally since then. I have had better days where I forget my symptoms but it has been bad lately. I went on a trip recently with my mother and I was incredibly anxious the entire time because my symptoms were heightened. I never had trouble with trips so the fact that I am unable to handle things the way I used to is very concerning. I haven't been able to eat normally as I feel nauseous often and have lost weight without trying. I have also felt dizzy and numb? Half of me is saying there is something is terribly wrong with me and that I need to get more tests done and second and third opinions and the other half is saying that my anxiety is what is actually causing the symptoms. It's a vicious cycle. I never used to be this way. It started when I took that medication and my mind is telling me that I will never be the same because of 2.5 months on an acne drug. Meanwhile doctors told me that I am 100 healthy. Please give me advice on what I should do.,Anxiety

Wednesday I saw a new primary doctor and brought up my issue with my chest pains they did an EKG chest xray and blood work and everything came out normal besides my LDL cholesterol which is 11 points high yet I still cant get over this??? My rational part of my brain thinks its chest inflammation and purely muscular issues but my anxiety forces me to believe its a heart attack.I also have shortness of breath sometimes like right now and Ive been slightly dizzy lately.Is there any way to cope with this?

35828,Is this shingles? Please help me So for a few days Ive had aches on the right side of my upper chest and under my right shoulder blade. Last night I decided to use nutmeg balm to try and soothe the ache. This morning when I woke up and checked myself in the mirror I had this rashhttpsimgur.comaz5TaEWc on the right side of my back on the shoulder blade.The rash doesnt hurt when I touch it and doesnt seem irritated. The only places which hurt are where my muscle ache is the rash does not cover those areas at all. If its shingles normally does the rash itself hurt when you touch it? Im confused to whether it actually is shingles or maybe just a reaction to the nutmeg balm. Ive used it before and never had a rash afterwards but after I applied the balm on my back last night I was sitting on a bare mattress duvet and pillows maybe it could be a reaction to that also?Please let me know if you have had similar experiences or if I should go see a doctor. Right now the rash doesnt give me any pain or irritation the only pain I have is from the aches on my chest and back that were there before the rash,Anxiety

I know this is weird but I had a meeting with my school's CBT counselor and she talked about how a good way to get over health anxiety is to just accept the fact that any of us could just drop dead at any moment. Honestly I feel like this is probably my best hope for getting over my health anxiety and panic attacks but I have no idea how I can train my mind to think like this.

I had been fine with this in the past but this time... It was really the first time I had any health anxiety and it hit HARD. I felt like I couldn't breathe felt like I was having a heart attack worried about having cancer all the fun problems.Since then I've gotten on SSRIs and have improved a lot but my girlfriend has to leave for another week soon. I think I'll be okay but I'm still a little worried that my anxiety is going to come back in full force. When she's home I have the comfort of knowing that she could take me to the hospital if anything awful happens but I feel very vulnerable when it's just me especially at night.

35836,Scarlet Fever Hey guys Im a 20 year old male. I had a bit of a sore throat waking up on Sunday but nothing too serious thought not too much of it as I was settling down for bed I noticed a bit of a rash on my chest which sent me to immediate panic. Fast forward to Monday and I have a full body rash and getting a lot of chills in the nights and when I wasnt medicated in the day I was pretty worried something was seriously wrong with me so organised an appointment with the doctor today. I went in and the doctor did a few tests on me Checked my throat tongue Ears chest back and my blood pressure and then told me Im sorry to tell you this but Im afraid you have scarlet fever I had no idea what it was until looking online after but surprised a 20 year old like myself has got it as its usually only children who get it to my understanding. I asked the doctor again and she confidently said that it was scarlet fever. Im on a set of antibiotics for 10 days now and have been told it should hopefully get a lot better within the next two days.... has anyone else ever encountered it? And do you think I should trust my doctors opinion I always have a fear that it may be something worse.Thanks,Anxiety

35838,Anxiety at it again over mice this time. What do you do to ease your mind? Ive had health anxiety in the past about rabies and amoeba. Each episode is weeks apart sometime a good couple months. Since Monday its been about hantavirus. Which I might add being in Australia there hasnt been any cases as of yet and to my knowledge dont have deer mice which are apparently a more common mouse to carry the virus. Nonetheless on Monday when I went into work there was some little black things on my desk that I thought was dried glue from work however turned out to be mouse poo. I only picked the one bit up before being told it was mouse poo then slid the rest onto paper towel with an aid so I didnt touch anymore with my hand directly. I then tossed it in the bin and washed my hands I could have touched my forehead prior to washing but I cant be sure. Anywho ever since then when I googled mouse poo originally just to see what it looked like and it lead me down a health anxiety hole so to say. There is some mouse poo around my area as I work near the kitchen however I didnt notice until I accidently picked a bit up off my desk with my bare hand. I know its unlikely to get Hanta I have posted in other threads however it doesnt ease my mind. How do you ease your mind when having anxiety over some disease?,Anxiety
35839,Nausea So recently my fear of throwing up has come back im pretty sure it happened after a night of heavy drinking and that lead to me getting sick. So ever since that night ive basically been in fear of it happening again so for about id say 3 weeks now im basically just always nauseous i feel horrible but eventually forced myself too eat. In a huge twist that no one saw coming after eating I actually felt better so my brain was like aha! I did it! I know its just anxiety! I can fix it!...but we all know its not nowhere near that easy its still a challenge for me to eat and at least 3 nights a week im up laying in bed praying for it to go away and begging God to help me even tho im not religious in the slightest. Im actually up right now writing this feeling nauseous yet strangely hungry and yes i know if youre really hungry sometimes you feel nauseous but the nauseous i have most nights im fairly sure isnt that. I know this is probably written horribly but i havent been sleeping well as im sure you can imagine but basically what im looking for is has anyone else had anything like this and what did you do to help yourself? My family is pretty worried as ive also lost some weight and obviously they know im not eating.,Anxiety

35842,Losing my mind over my palpitations... I have had heart palpitations and severe anxiety for the last 6 years. Today is my 25th birthday and I am overwhelmed with stress about these palpitations. Im 510 and 210lbs so a tad overweight. I have been to several doctors and a cardiologist over the last 4 years the cardiologist visit was just about 6 months ago and no one can seem to find anything wrong with my heart. My blood tests come back great my echocardiogram results were immaculate. I even wore an event monitor for a few days and it recorded a few episodes that my cardiologist told me were no cause for concern. But I just cant shake the feeling that there is something seriously wrong with me. I can go weeks or months without noticing a single skipped beat or flutter and other times like today where I have 10 or more in a day! They scare me. Some are very light and feel like a small jolt. Others feel like a big flutter or thud and usually make me jerk or gasp. Sometimes I feel out of breath from them. I do go the gym every day and never get them while exercising which is a good thing. I have never fainted or passed out or anything either. They dont hurt. They just scare the crap out of me and I cannot get it through my head that there isnt anything wrong with me.,Anxiety
35843,Cant stop worrying about severe illness cancer surgery and anesthesia failure think Im going to jinx it happening by stopping worrying about it. This is pretty superstitious but basically its the fear of the fact that often things happen when you least expect them so Im afraid to stop expecting them to happen in order to control them into not happening. The other thing is that if I stop worrying about them I get comfortable and attached to my lifestyle and then if something happens its going to be more of a letdown. This already happened this year. I got a very small Pilonidal Cyst now on track to get a minor procedure to remove it and at first I was devastated mostly because for a while I had forgotten about the possibility of these things happening so there was more of a shock value. Im afraid of the shock factor of enjoying my life and being hit with cancer versus expecting it all along and hopefully mitigating a bit of it.,Anxiety

Ever since my own Doc informed me about the risks of ovarian cancer I can't get it out of my head.I made her see the doctor but she just went for a normal checkup instead of asking for an ultrasound. They did take a blood sample but that is hardly enough to rule this out right?I really want to let this go because right now it will be impossible to make her go again and I got enough else to worry about. On the other hand if I am right and stop pushing her it will be my fault it wasn't found early enough...The hell do I do now?,Anxiety

35848,Scared to exercise Ive had health anxiety for around 5 years now and it was based around a fear of cancer after a scare I had in 2014 but in during a run in February I had a pretty bad panic attack that I mistook for a heart attackcardiac arrest which really shit me up and Ive been terrified of any heart related problems since. I used to love runningworking out and would exercise 56 times a week but since the panic attack Ive been scared to go for a run or do any strenuous exercises in the gym such as deadlifts. If I do exercise I spend the entire time terrified something might happen to me and it has just ruined something I used to really enjoy. Does anyones health anxiety stop them from enjoying or even doing any exercise?,Anxiety
35849,i had some bloodwork this week amp last and now i got my period is it normal to feel like this or should i do something? hi so last week i had some blood taken for a test. and then this past tuesday i had some taken this one was rough i almost passed out amp threw up. afterwards i felt so gross and tingly and weak. well i got my period last night. and today im back to feeling this tingly weak way my friend said its because they took so much blood and that im on my period which i always have a very heavy flow and also ik anemic so that doesnt help lmao.but yeah no i feel very shaky and my feet are tingling and are going numb my hands are tingling and im just exhausted. i was at work earlier and jokingly asked my friend to check my pulse and she said it actually felt faster than a normal pulse. is this normal? does it make sense? i called my dr just to be safe and they took what i said out of context and went on a tangent and gave a spiel about periods and how i should visit with an OBGYN which im doing at the end of the month i just absolutely hate this feeling of tingly and weak and exhausted. is there anything i can do to make it better? or is it just a waiting game?,Anxiety

35851,Strong pulse just under left breast? Is it normal to feel a very strong pulse just under your left breast? It feels like my heart is beating very strongly there but it seems like it's too far below where the maximum point of impact would be if it were my actual heart. Usually I can just feel it if I put my hand there but sometimes I can feel it just in my chest itself. Also I can visually see my sternum moving in and out if I look in a mirror.,Anxiety
35852,Rash? Eczema? Scabies? ? Im and 18F student and ever since coming to college Ive had very bad health anxiety where as soon as any small thing is wrong Im online 810 hours a day trying to diagnose.My most recent issue is a rash Ive had on my forearms wrists and back of my hands for the past few days. Its very itchy mostly at night and when I scratch I get hivelike spots that sometimes stay and sometimes go away. I also have little white bumps that are very tiny and dont show up well in pictures. Ive been applying hydrocortisone 1 since Saturday night and its still happening so today I bought Benadryl cream and made an appt at my universities health services for tomorrow morning. After looking online Ive narrowed it down to hives eczema scabies or maybe ringworm. I think scabies scares me the most. I woke up this morning to myself scratching my wrists like crazy after doing so good not scratching and then I started hyperventilating because I was so scared because I have read scabies is worst at night. Also Ive been feeling itchy around my ears scalp and legs but nothing is as itchy or hive like as my wrists.Overall I dont really know what else to do as everytime I look at it I freak out and I cant talk to anyone about it because they laugh when I say it might be scabies or something serious. I feel so stupid. picture httpsimgur.comTBLL4Oc,Anxiety

35854,how to tell a pimple from early signs of MSRA or flesh eating disease? i'm really hoping this is just from over sweating i had part of my arm resting on my desk i was sweating after listen to music rather energetically i raise my arm and suddenly notice a reddish raised bump that looked like a pimple only thing was it came on suddenly i didn't have this before its not painful mainly slightly soreuncomfortable gets sorer when touched. at first i thought it was just a bite or a pimple i googled Sudden Pimple on arm and got a result for Woman mistakes flesh eating disease for pimple dies. and had a near fucking panic attack. Recently someone in the household had to drive some family to the E.R i'm worried they might have tracked some sort of MRSA back with them as they had to stay for a few hours. I'm really hoping this is just a sweat pimple because the desk could have been impairing the skins ability to breath. I used to get similar bumps on my legs when working out with some particularly uncomfortable briefs so i'm really hoping thats all it is but i can't shake the fear that it could be something more severe.,Anxiety
35855,Possible explanation for brain fog headaches fatigue dizziness with normal labimaging findings Hi allI really hope this doesn't stir up more anxiety for anyone but I have a possible explanation for some of the symptoms that often pop up here especially for the folks that think they have a brain tumor. When the bones of the neck are not in proper alignment a lordotic curve whether from past trauma e.g. whiplash repetitive micro trauma or poor posture it can cause a bunch of symptoms that a lot of people are attributing to brain tumors headaches dizziness vision issues brain fog fatigue etc.. A formal xrayCTMRI report will not usually comment on an absent lordotic curve if there is nothing pathologically wrong bone spurs herniations etc. with the vertebrae or disc space but a nonlordotic curve does cause real symptoms. I came across this information through physiochiro so if you're someone that slouches and has migraines and headaches try keeping your chin tucked in don't stay in awkward positions take breaks from computer work drink water get a comfortable pillow and keep your shoulders rolled back. I know not everyone's issues are related to this but it may be worth a try if your medical tests all came back negative but you're still experiencing symptoms.,Anxiety
35856,Neck lumppain Looking for some reassurance or advice if anyone else has experienced this. Two days ago I noticed a lump on the left side of my neck under my jaw. Its painful when I turn my head to the left and when I swallow. Im thinking its a swollen lymph node but I dont have any other symptoms of an infection cold flu etc besides very mild left ear pain like maybe the beginning of an ear infection?. Im sure its nothing but it is causing some serious anxiety its all I can think about. My thoughts are immediately jumping to lymphatic cancer or a malignant tumor. Im planning to make a doctors appointment if Im still feeling weird tomorrow. Has anyone else experienced something similar to this?,Anxiety
35857,Friend on Facebook posted about Nuvaring causing pulmonary embolisms My husband left for deployment yesterday and so I'm anxious in general. Then yesterday my car also broke down and will be down for the week. To top it off a friend on Facebook posted about Nuvaring giving people pulmonary embolism. So I googled it to soothe myself. Bad move. Now I'm even more anxious about it because there were so many people saying it causes heart attacks and their daughter has died from Nuvaring and blah blah. I have heart palpitations from anxiety and now I'm worried it's not anxiety and actually a sign of my Nuvaring slowly trying to kill me. Ugh.,Anxiety
35858,Overcoming personal anxiety by helping others Long time HA sufferer and poster. I am fortunate enough to say I have managed my HA enough to a point where its not consistently affecting my life. Just want to share a few pearls. Our health anxiety is very self centered. We obsess over health our bodies etc. the key to recovery is to stop focusing on ourselves. More on this later. Everybody on here is a bit different. I personally feel a sense of relief with medical testing doctor visits etc but some are fearful of those things. For that reason this post may not apply to you. A lot of us are in the medical field. I myself am a dentist and have had the irony of dealing with hypochondriacs in my office who are worried about oral cancer. Examining a fearful patient the other day and reassuring him that he does not have oral cancer gave me an epiphany of sorts which led me to the following. Today I joined the national bone marrow donation match website. Its a wonderful opportunity to help out people that are going through what we all in this sub fear the most terminal cancer. Think about it you can save a life!Minimal procedure. A needle in your hip. Some painkillers and you are on your way. Not only that but theres such a barrage of testing beforehand that you can all but be guaranteed that you dont have any sort of underlying illness. They only take 1844 year old healthy donors for the most part all of the testing is free and meals and rides are covered. I dont know if Ill ever get called but the whole thing puts my personal health anxieties in perspective. To save a childs life from leukemia for example would forever change your life. Im not saying you need to do this. But take the focus away from yourself. Whether its through charity or through work school gym I promise you will stop obsessing over your headache leg twitch or your heart flutter. I still have bad days but overall I can say Ive improved a great deal from this philosophy.,Anxiety
35859,Anxious about Rabies even though there's no reason to I think Hey all. I've been having a hell of a week and to be honest looking back it's really dumb but I can't help but be anxious anyway.So back on Thursday last week I was feeding this stray cat. Didn't know it was a stray at first since it's a pretty packed neighborhood with a lot of pet cats so I didn't expect a stray. After a few days of feeding it it ended up scratching me because I pet it way too much. Didn't really worry about it too much washed the cut off and went on with my day.Then I googled what would happen from a stray cat scratch. Obviously this was a mistake but I did it anyway. First result was Rabies. Cue my panic mode realizing I could have gotten it from the cat. I started to worry constantly for the next 2 days and on Saturday I went to the ER. Doctors didn't think anything would have happened but they decided to give me the rabies shots anyway just in case. This settled my anxiety for a bit but I started to worry again googling if the shots ever failed. They have but only in countries like India and China never in the US.Over the past week I've been trying to fight with myself that I don't have Rabies. Last time I saw the cat was on Monday but since it's a stray I wouldn't expect it to stay around my house since I stopped feeding it. Now over the past few days I've started to feel pain in my throat at random times not triggered by anything. I keep feeling headaches and getting itchiness on my arm not isolated to it though and I keep thinking food and drinks aren't going down my throat easily. Logically speaking it's nothing but I keep being convinced it's the rabies starting to cause symptomsNow I have multiple reasons not to believe I'm gonna have anything wrong but I can't convince myself that. The likelihood of the cat having rabies with no symptoms is low me getting rabies from a cat scratch is even lower and me getting it after getting shots is virtually none but my mind just won't accept that. I keep thinking of what ifs.What if the cat had rabies?What if the scratch gave me rabies?What if I got the vaccine too late? It was 2 days later that could have been too late.What if the vaccine doesn't work and I still get it?What if my symptoms are from rabies?What if the cat isn't around because it died from Rabies?I honestly need some sense knocked into me I can't stop worrying about it. Sorry for the long post.,Anxiety

35864,Cervical cancer scare I am scared that I'll have cancer. I used to have abnormal paps but the last 2 which was done 3 years ago was normal. I just did one 5 weeks ago and my doctor called me today to tell me I was high grade and needed to go for a colposcopy. I'm so upset and can't stop crying or worrying. I don't know what to do to feel better. What if in those 3 years it has developed to a stage of cervical cancer or something? Im so mad at myself for having unprotected sex when I was younger. I love my boyfriend so much and I want to spend the rest of my life with him and have kids. And I'm probably overreacting but what if I can't have kids or live a long happy life? I'm type 1 Diabetic as well and possibly have PCOS. I live a very healthy lifestyle and it all seems like such a waste right now. I just wish this was all a bad dream.

So recently Ive been getting UTIs Ive always gotten like 2 per year since I was about 18. I try everything to avoid them. But I went in the other day to get it checked out and the test came back negative. So they think something might be wrong structurally. Im so nervous that I have PID or ovarian cancer. I keep checking my symptoms. I called out of work because the pain was so bad. And my anxiety is through the roof.

After like 10min however my eyes started to feel weird like my perception has changed I'm still able to type and stuff and I'm not dizzy nor do I have a headache.

It might just be my anxiety playing tricks on me which has happened before but I'm not sure.,Anxiety

I have an appointment in May and I promise Ill tell my doctor then. Unrelated but I was in a car accident recently. I go to college out of state so my parents came up to help me as I am injured. It happened again today I highly doubt it is related to the accident as this has been happening for years. I want to finally tell them but Im afraid theyll think its related to the accident and freak out thinking Im dying and rush me to the er. I could email my doc as this is easier to admit over email rather than spoken word. But I am also afraid the doc will freak out and try to get me to go to the er.

51861,I live with two people in my family who have schizophrenia and there was a butcher knife placed on a picture of me im a 19 year old cc student and i live with my grandma mom uncle aunt and little sister.my mom has a meth addiction and shes developed schizophrenia from it and its been getting worse as the years go on. my uncle was hit on the head at a young age and im not exactly sure what he struggles since we never talk but i think its schizophrenia. my mom doesnt take her meds i think and my grandma is constantly trying to help her with moving in and out of motels and rehabs and all this stuff for the past 8 months or so realistically shes been trying to help her for many many years now but my mom had moved out recently my mom moved back in like a week ago. my uncle is very strange and i dont know really anything about him. he leaves his room a few times a day and doesnt talk to anyone sometimes i hear him talk to himself in his room but he doesnt yell and scream like my mom does hes just very quiet and intense. so earlier tonight i was using my grandmas phone for school since mine was dead and i got curious to look in her messages between my mom because ive seen messages between them before where my mom is talking about how she hears voices talking about someone wanting to kill me and how shes constantly was thinking about me and she doesnt think im safe. so i looked and my aunt shes mentally well sent my grandma a picture where she found a big butcher knife placed on top of a picture of me. the message said uncles name is acting strange again. i asked moms name if she did this and she said she didnt. does uncles name know what it means to stab someone? that they will die? in the photo my aunt sent my grandma the picture of me was in like a mouse pad that was custom made with a photo of me from 4th grade. the thing is im not sure if its a coincidence because the mouse pad is on a desk for like where a computer used to be but the desk in like directly connected to the kitchen like almost next to it so it could be possible that someone had happened to place that knife there so i didnt really freak out. but i talked to some friends and when i kinda said it out loud to them i did kinda realize like damn that does kinda sound bad and they told me that yea its probably not safe. i dont know if it was my uncle or mom either though if it even was intentional. my uncle used to come home and hit me in the head as a kid a lot and we would yell and scream at each other we lived together for like 6 years and this would happen then we moved then we moved again and he moved back in with us but ever since we moved back in again we literally do not talk to each other at all. hes very awkward around me and everyone tbh and quiet and i can tell he doesnt like to be in the same room as me even though i do not interact with him at all whatsoever. weve said hey to each other like less than 10 times over the years and thats about it. he does kinda seem like he hates me but i dont think he would want to kill me. on the other hand its possible that my mom was lying to my aunt but from what ive seen i dont think my mom wants to kill me either. whenever she has talked about me in that way its more of a this is my son i need to protect him from whoever gonna kill him type of way rather than a malicious tone. but again they are both schizophrenic which i really dont know much about besides they can be unpredictable and so thats why im asking. i know its weird to ask about this on reddit but i really dont have anyone to talk to about it. im not going to directly confront my uncle about it because again we are very distant and hes a big guy i just dont want to i feel like itd be worse and i dont want to ask my mom because i know she would say no even if she did. im going to ask my grandma tomorrow since i havent been able to since shes been asleep all night but shes just going to ignore me after i express my concerns which she always does. i can talk to my aunt about it even though were not really too close but yeah. another thing is my grandma sent the photo my aunt sent her to my uncle asking if he did it and he kind of just ignored it didnt deny it so. but yea i cant really move out or anything i dont have the money for that since i just graduated high school and honestly i dont have a job right now since im a full time student and i just dont know where i would go. i dont have any friends that would let me live with them either so thats out of the picture . the best thing im hoping for is the convince my grandma to have them move out but thatll probably never happen even though i want it to so bad. i just dont know if this is a coincidence with the knife and i shouldnt be worried or what i should do so yea pls help,Anxiety

51864,Anyone here also feels like they'll be Lonely Forever because of Social Anxiety? I think ever since I was bullied in school I always was afraid of people. I missed so many opportunities in my life because no matter how many self help books I was reading I was just not able to overcome my anxiety. And even if I managed to be normal around people I still felt lonely. Because I felt like an alien like I was different to everyone else. A normal relationship with a woman who accepts me for who I am? gt Not available since I finished school! Friends with whom I can share my hopes and dreams and who I feel deeply connected with? gt Not for me! Just interact with people without feeling completely nervous and socially awkward? gt Impossible!With 22 I knew that either I have to change something or it will stay like this forever!It was a wild journey ever since and despite a lot of set backs rejections insecurities and the feeling that I am too unlovable for anyone I can say that I overcame my social anxiety.I don't want to brag with this post the only thing I want is to give you hope in times where you maybe feel no hope.Maybe this here is the motivation for YOU to take the first step today. To look out of the comfort zone a tiny little bit. To get help when you need help as it is a sign of strength to ask for help not of weakness.

51866,What tf us happening to me Every single day I feel the life inside of me just fall down as if it were sand every day I feel like I can't breathe I just sit and look around because even though no one sees it I feel like my lings are vomiting inside me.Every single day I want to kill myself while at the same time having a panic attack because I don't want to die.And then I just sit there not bothering anyone because no one can look at me and tell me my intestines are silently spinning no one can look at me and see my heart beating way too fast and know I'm not breathing.And certainly no one knows that every fucking day while I try to live my life I see myself in a grave not feeling any physical sensation at all its almost as if I can see the future almost as if old me is sitting in bed slowly rotting away dead and no one has checked up on me for several hoursWhy tf am I like this I'm 14 I'm supposed to enjoy life but insead I hate this shit and I hate living with this terrible anxiety about nothing and everything at the same time not living because I don't wanna die which makes me want to kill myselfThe worst part is I'm not even diagnosed with an anxiety disorder because I'm too scared to talk to anyone about it and so no one will ever know because I don't know people well enough to tell them this. I guess I don't mind sharing with strangers online thoHope you have a nice day and I hope your anxiety gets better because I wish no ine had to suffer like this,Anxiety
51867,Can anxiety get triggered by nothing? I dont know how to explain it but the last week or two I have been in a constant panic mode. always on edge I feel sick 247 crying etc. But nothing has triggered me ? I just woke up one day and I knew something wasnt right in my brain I just felt really fuzzy and confused and now two weeks later Im in a constant fight or flight mode.,Anxiety
51868,Crazy how powerful thought diaries amp breathing techniques have been for my anxiety I've been undergoing therapy for anxiety and depression for the past two months. My therapist recommended that I start keeping a thought diary to write down any worries or concerns that I may have and to practice a breathing technique that involves breathing in for four seconds holding for two and then exhaling for four seconds.Initially I was skeptical that these simple practices could make a difference in something that has troubled me for years. However I began to notice that whenever I started to become consumed by anxious or depressive thoughts jotting them down in my diary helped me immensely. This process allowed me to break down those thoughts and identify that 99 of the time my worries and depression stem from hypothetical situations.For instance one of my thoughts was What if my friends are judging me behind my back? for context this was after we went out for drinks. The key phrase in that being 'What if' meaning it's just hypothetical with no real evidence to back up the worry. So in my thought diary alongside my worrisome thought I would write down a 'Helpful thought' where I deconstruct this worry. For the aforementioned thought my helpful thought wasThis is a hypothetical worry you have no evidence to suggest this will happen. Your friend's opinion of you shouldn't be taken seriously anyway. You don't need to seek approval from your friends.Of course this may not help everyone but I wanted to share how thought diaries have helped my mental health and they can be quite powerful. TLDR My therapist recommended keeping a thought diary and practicing breathing techniques to help my anxiety and depression. Writing down my thoughts and using the breathing technique has helped me identify that 99 of my worries are hypothetical. I recommend trying it out.,Anxiety

51870,Ive been trying to get help for months its so frustrating Our healthcare system is so over burdened. The psychiatrist in town has an almost 9 month wait list but I finally got in. The communityparent support worker I was connected to cancelled our sessions because their department ran out of funding the program was cut. Im waiting until they announce the new budget in April and get more funding. Then Ill get a worker backIm giving every ounce of effort I have to get the supports I need and use them so that I can learn to function on my own. I have a 4 year old and I hate how im raising him. I feel like an asshole trying to explain to my dr that even though my house is full of food I struggle to feed him properly because I have no appetite I dont cook for myself and I dont know what to feed him. I look at all the food in my cupboard and I cant make a decision on what to make. But then my son tells me hes hungry right now so I just microwave a pizza pocket or corn dog for him. Im just so tired. Im failing at everything. Ive reached out for support and the people in the roles want to help me bc they see me trying. My psychiatrist even has seen me on his days off.

Have been and am still going to therapy on antidepressants and have been on hydroxyzine. Recently my doctor prescribed me .5mg of xanax every day.

I have never misused it or done anything wrong but I feel guilty for using it every day and Im scared Ill become addicted and have withdrawals. Can someone give me some insight on this please?,Anxiety
51872,just some thoughts for you be patient with yourself.its okay to say no. YOU are experiencing your life. nobody knows how you feel. your feelings are valid and its okay to set boundaries. its okay if you cant do it today. it takes a lot of energy for you to always fight against your worries and anxiety. so its totally understandable if you need some space and peace. dont surround yourself with people that drain your energy. its okay to let them go. this gives you more energy to focus on the good people and things in your life.i hope you have a good day today. but also dont have too much expectations. its totally fine if not everything is going to work out today.,Anxiety

51874,Some advice to my people HelloI've been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks my whole life and while I take a ridiculous amount of meds for it including lorazapam pregablin etc I was informed about Magnesium and I wanted to share this with you.So a lot of us get anxiety attacks triggered by the stress hormone cortisol magnesium works by by stimulating the production of melatonin and serotonin which boost your mood and help you sleep. Magnesium also reduces the production of cytokines and cortisol which lead to increased inflammation and stress.It's important that you don't over do it as you can poison yourself with magnesium and you also have to make sure it's aspartate citrate lactate and chloride forms as oxide apparently doesn't absorb as well.Speak to your pharmacist or Dr if you're mixing medication but I have been able to reduce the amount of lorazapam I've needed since starting mag and its helped a lot with sleep. I'm truly impressed.,Anxiety

51876,Horrible Fear of Food Being Drugged Lately Ive been having this massively irrational fear of my food being laced with LSD or some other form of psychedelics. I wont eat something thats been already opened regardless of whether or not its mine which has led to me not only wasting food but actively avoiding eating unless I make it right there and even then it takes quite a bit of effort. This in turn has also led me to having a fear of an undiagnosed mental illness and I cant quite afford to go to a doctor currently to figure out if that is the case.Ive only ever been technically drugged once when the cannabis my friend bought was laced with PCP a few months ago but this fear extends back to when I was around fifteen twenty three now. Ive done acid only twice and while I did enjoy it its not something Im likely to do again and I rarely smoke cannabis or drink but I did do a lot of both for a few years. Obviously nobody is gonna waste good acid on me but the fear is constantly there to the point that I yelled at my brother the other day for jokingly pretending to drop something into my Gatorade on the way to work hes unaware of this fear and threw it away despite it being completely full and even avoided eating the cookies my mom brought down for Christmas which made me feel awful as there is absolutely no way my mom would ever do anything like that to me.Im iffy on telling anybody close to me about this fear for a few reasons the main one being the irrationality of it all but I also do not want to be sent to an inpatient center again cant afford it as I was for depression as a minor. Sorry for the rambling wall of text but I just need to know if this is signs of a more major illness or at the very least how I can possibly cope with it.,Anxiety
51877,Hurry sickness is driving me crazy. Does anyone else have this? I have hurry sickness and it's linked to my anxiety and BPD. It causes me so much anxiety because I always feel like I need to do many things at the same time or short period of time. I drink my coffee in about 5 minutes then I read a book for an hour then I listen to music and surf the web for a nonspecific reason. Everything has to be done very fast and wellplanned if not I get impatient irritable and anxious. It's pretty exhausting and I realized it's a problem going on for two years now. I did not pay too much attention to this before since I didn't even know there was a term for this condition. Does anyone else experience something similar? How are you dealing with it?,Anxiety

51879,Asked my parents who I don't live with for an extra 10 or so a week spending money and they've turned it into a big thing I am currently under an intense care plan as an outpatient at a mental health hospital. One of the nurses suggested asking for an extra amount of allowance. 'well off' but not rich parents completely fund me while I'm at university as my loan is less than my rent.I was debating asking for weeks me and my parents have had a strained relationship in the past to say the least some definitely their fault some a mix of both of our faults. Anyway it's left a gap between us that I haven't been brave enough to cross.But last night I asked them told them I wasn't struggling with the current allowance it would purely be for an extra nice thing a week to help me get by during these times. IMO they've blown it way out of proportion they wanted a phone call today to log all my spending and now they're wanting to come and visit me TODAY. It's sending my anxiety haywire this is why I don't open up or ask anything from my parents.What do I do? Say no to them visiting all together? I'm 100 fine with keeping the current allowance I just want a yes or a no to have some closure on this conversation with my parents.So I'll repeat my question with your limited knowledge of my life What do I do??,Anxiety

51883,Doctors notesrecords Hi just wondering if anybody knows about if doctors think you are drug seeking do they put that on your record? I went to doctors yesterday didnt see my usual GP it was about spinal pain that radiates up my back only seems to hurt after physical activity which is weird but concerning to me. The day before appointment I went gym amp done some light training on back muscles which really set it off was painful amp felt weird afterwards like weakness in my arms bit dizzy and just a general weak feeling like really weak and disorientated. She was not helpful at all basically done a quick ops check checked my back briefly amp said it seems ok. She said to rest on weekend and see how I go she said hot water bottle. The more im thinking about my appointment with a her yesterday I get the impression she feels I was drug seeking. I never asked for any drugs but I feel she was misunderstanding me being concerned with trying to get drugs. She said something when I sat down like youre looking to discuss pain management I didnt really take it in as was really anxious and tired so I said yeah about my spine then proceeded to talk about my concerns but not once did I say anything about wanting medicationsdrugs. Im annoyed now I should of been clear that I would of liked a referral to be checked out or something. Im on pregabalin for anxiety it also just happens to be a nerve pain drug and she said few times about youll have review soon with usual GP to see if its helping my anxiety and not just about pain management. She also said youve only upped dosage 10 days ago. I didnt really take it in properly at the time but I feel she thinks I was trying to up my dose or get pain meds? Im worried now that it will be on my notes and Im also frustrated that I didnt correct her properly. Any advice or help on this would be appreciated im very anxious about this I feel I was totally misunderstood and I dont like the thought of her putting on notes I was looking for pain management or medication to help that. I also noticed as I was leaving she done a frustrated sigh. This experience has made me feel invalidated misunderstood and made my anxiety and depression worse. Im struggling mentally very very bad to say the least.,Anxiety

I've been on Abilify and Alprazolam for years never had been feeling alert on them always either sleepy or have weird feeling in my stomach. Now I've tried everything with these meds be it smoking or alcohol I stopped all of it because it caused very nasty problems with me when I stopped I finally felt myself even through I've read on Wikipedia that coffee can also cause problems when you take these meds it's says even small amounts can cause side effects that's called caffeine induced anxiety.I'm not really sure how am I supposed to be awake I mean I'm unemployed still in hands of my parents and other family members who take care of me and understand my problems but how did you manage to stay awake without coffee or did coffee really help you without feeling weird all time while on meds? It would be stupid for me to sleep all day and miss some important events or have fun chatting with friends or playing video games or better yet studying different topics like electrical engineering or making homemade circuits. Not electrical engineer just doing something for hobby.,Anxiety

Its like I just want to skip to the good part. I feel like the work is only productiveuseful when its good.How do you even deal with the uncomfortable parts of learning and growing?

51893,Advice Ive been dealing with some anxiety issues my whole life. Ive had lots of trama and was diagnosed with ADHD as a young child. Never being able to focus and always the most loud and distributive in school. I used to stay up at night as a kid because after watching the slightest scary movie I would be afraid. Anyways the point of the backstory is to give you a sense of who I was. Lately within the past year my anxiety has been through the roof. I find it very hard to focus and have lots of thoughts at once. Even some that just pop into my head. I can hear other peoples tone of voice. Not like big conversation. My anxiety was so high I was getting lots of physical symptoms heart palpitations chest pain shortness of breath to which I thought I had a heart problem. So I went to the doctors and got all the tests and didnt believe my heart was fine until I got the results. I thought about this everyday. To which now I think this might had been a delusion. My point is Im very worried Im developing Schizophrenia. My family does have a history of mental health issues.I know this post is confusing and if Im worried about my mental health I should see a doctor. But Im just looking for advice.EditI would like to add that for a long time when I went home after a long day I could not relax to fall asleep. My mind would be racing. The only way I could describe it is like a radio. In order to drown it out I would have to put on music to fall asleep.,Anxiety

51895,Anxiety has ruined my life... I need some advicehelp Gonna be a little long gonna rant a bitLittle back story 20yearold male no past history of major anxiety other than flying on planes etc..Last year from January to April was feeling the best I have ever felt in my life! worked out 67 days a week confidence was high and not a care in the world. I would say around May I started getting increasingly fatigued every day. As the days went on it felt like I was detached from reality. By the end of the year I felt so detached fatigued and had major brain fog. I have a small bump on the back of my head it doesn't hurt I got it checked out and the doc said it could be a skull deformity. I dont believe her. I convinced myself that I had something wrong with me and I went down the rabbit hole of selfdiagnosing by reading google i know worst idea ever. I could only function to the fraction I could before my snapping point. I felt so depolarized and had no energy at this point. I convinced myself I had a chronic illness that I was going to die from I still belive this I got every scan and lab work done. Nothing came of it. I had no idea what was causing all of these symptoms. Fast forward to January I started a very stressful college class. It is an intensive academytype class. I thought I had my stress pretty well controlled but in February I had my first panic attack ever. Went to school that day feeling fine didn't eat breakfast but drank 180mg of caffeine I usually have 300mg a day. During the afternoon portion of the class I felt this sense of impending doom and shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest. For 2 hours my HR was in the 130s. I had no Idea what was going on and felt like I was gonna die. So my teacher wanted me transported to the ER My EKG came back normal sinus tachycardia fast heart rate. They pulled labs and everything was normal except for low magnesium and potassium. They gave me some fluids and discharged me. For the next few days my heart rate was a constant 120 even when resting and my anxiety was through the roof! It sucked! My doctor then prescribed me Lexapro and man oh man hats of to anyone that could get through that first phase of Lexapro. It trashed me constant panic attacks SOB tingling the whole 9 yards. I stopped after 5 days due to the fact that I didn't want to be tied to a pill at such a young age. Since my panic attack Ive had constant anxiety. Im having anxiety about things Ive never worried about before! it sucks! Its like I have to experience all these things over again like driving to tell myself there is nothing to be anxious about. Ill also be sitting in the most comfortable place in my house not stressed at all then my heart rate will kick off to the 120s for the whole day. Do you guys experience this? I also feel like I'm having heart palpitations. It feels like my heart is in my throat and I can't catch my breath. It sucks! Every time I stand up my heart rate jumps. It takes a long time for me to calm down and convince myself I'm not dying. I know my case is minor to some cases Ive read but damn Im having a hard time with this. Im in constant fear and anxious about having another anxiety attack and passing out. Im trying everything I can before I commit to an antidepressant. Im trying L theanine Ashwagandha and magnesium. I got prescribed adarax but it doesn't seem to help like ativan does. I just want my old life back. Is this normal? Does it get better? will it be like this forever? how did you guys get over your anxiety? tips? medications? Thank you all for taking time and reading my post I really appreciate it. I just really need some help...,Anxiety

51898,Terrified of going to the dentist I know I have some cavities because I went to the dentist sometime last year and they scheduled an appointment for fillings but when I showed up no one was there and they wouldn't answer my calls for months so I gave up. But tonight I was looking at my teeth and I'm pretty sure I see one. I don't see any actual black or decay just an indent that was hiding behind some tartar but everyone's always told me that once you can see a cavity it's already too far and the tooth usually needs to be pulled might not be true just what I've been told I'm hopefully going to make an appointment on Monday but I'm so nervous because my teeth are terrible. I don't have any missing or rotting teeth but I can never remember to brush them and I had hg a couple years ago that turned into a 3 year long problem of throwing up multiple times a day. So they're yellow have a ton of build up and I'm pretty sure they told me I have gum disease at my last appointment. I'm so worried they're going to judge me and think I'm disgusting. I'm also terrified of getting fillings because the numbing shots never work fully for me so it's always super painful. I checked their website and it says that they offer nitrous conscious sedation and iv sedation but I'm not even sure my insurance will pay for unnecessary sedation since nitrous makes me freak out. And then how would I ask for it without sounding like a drug seeker?? I'm sorry if this seems like rambling. I'm just freaking out.,Anxiety

Its getting to the point of when my dogs bark I start to cry because Im so scared.,Anxiety
51904,My mom doesn't believe anxiety is real I finally got the courage to talk to a professional today for my anxiety. I got prescibed medication and I told my mom expecting she would be glad for me. She was not. She got super angry and told me anxiety is not real and that the medical and drug industries are just a big mafia looking to exploit people for profit. She told me I'm just going to get worse and that the medication will turn me into a lethargic zombie. Also she didn't approve that the dr. gave me a 2 week sick leave from work and made me feel bad for skipping work. I feel so bad now. Maybe I shouldn't have seeked help after all?,Anxiety
51906,I am tired of having anxiety I am physically and mentally very exhausted right now and I tried to fall asleep but Im so nauseous from my anxiety that I really just couldnt and sometimes I just like want to feel normal so bad but I feel like I will never get there. My anxiety sucks so bad. I feel like most days it controls who i am and what i act like for that day. Today i went out with my friends and we had a good time but we ended up being outside a lot longer than we would and i got extremely cold and started panicking. We were far from everyones house and all i wanted was to go home. They came to my house afterwards and it was nice for a while but i was still feeling anxious. When they all left i felt immediately better like this huge weight on my chest being lifted off. its not that i dont like my friends but being around people is so exhausting. I hate that im like this i just wanna feel normal so bad. I get anxious so easily and it wont go away for hours. Then when im not feeling anxious i feel depressed. It constantly feels like a never ending storm or something. Like just when it starts to feel bright and the rain might stop it starts again and gets so dark. Im constantly fighting just to stay sane and its so hard. All i want is to feel normal and okay and maybe real because im constantly dissociating. I do have a therapist btw,Anxiety

51908,Had a really bad turn the last few days Hi everyone I've had anxiety for the last 6 months or so in varying levels. From January I was in a decent headspace with it but the last three weeks it's got worse and then the last four days or so it's gone off a cliff. It's all I think about all day long I had panic attacks on Monday and Wednesday and my heart is racing all day. Where before I'd wake up rested now I wake up with my heart racing and frequently my muscles are spasming which is scary. The thought of doing normal stuff feels impossible and I can't shake this feeling I can't get better than this ever again. I spoke to my doctor on Thursday and he prescribed propranolol which I took yesterday for the first time which helped with the body stuff but my mind was still racing.Has anyone experienced similar and have any tips? I feel like this is really really bad and worse than most people have anxiety.,Anxiety

51911,Overwhelmed tried struggling I was diagnosed with an otherspecified anxiety disorder for about a year now and that sent me into a tailspin during my diagnosis. I was doing therapy consistently since then and felt like I had a handle on things but was triggered into another episode a month ago.I just feel disconnected and kind of dead now. I've had on and off anxiety the whole month it's affected my relationship I'm exhausted all the time struggling also with stomach issues and feel like I'm barely keeping my head above water. My partner has tried to be supportive but I can tell it wears him down. I can't see how I can keep doing this and feeling like this forever. I don't even know what I'm looking for from this post but I just wanted to write something out because I feel tired and sad and alone.,Anxiety

51922,Have my body forgotten how to breath properly? I have a constant feeling of tightness in my chest.No matter how i breathe i can never take a breath that feels relaxing and satisfying.Sometimes when i don't pay attention to my breathing i subconsciously hold my breath for a few seconds only to gasp for air a few moments later.Most of the time my breathing is shallow and irregular.A lifetime of anxiety and the associated sensation of having a hard time breathing makes me believe my nervous system have forgotten how to breath properly. Can anyone relate?,Anxiety
51923,Anxiety stopping me from working Ive been dealing with anxiety for a while now I came to the realisation a few years ago that it has mainly stemmed from the relationship with my dad I had when I was younger. This is caused me to not be able to do tasks in front of people wether they be simple or not I just cant do it. I start lightly trembling and thinking about how stupid I must look to whoever is watching me this causes me to mess up even more. This is really stopped me from wanting to go out and get a job because I know that if the interview goes well I actually do good in interviews weirdly then I will eventually have to be shadowed and critiqued by someone while I learn the job. This dread has stopped me from going to 3 interviews now. Does anyone else get this? Sorry for the long post.,Anxiety
51924,Dry heaving Ive been dealing with a really complex personal issue involving heartbreak loss of a person I deeply care about certainly the worst pain Ive experienced in my life thus far. As it stands I already carry a level of anxiety with me but with this added on to it my body has been putting me through hell. I find myself dry heaving hard in the mornings especially and then at times throughout the day. This has led to some really painful vomiting on several occasions. Its also occurred at my workplace the gym and several other public places without warning. I know theres absolutely a psychosomatic part of all of this but after almost three weeks its becoming really problematic for me. Has anyone experienced something similar? Is this just something I have to power through? Are there any tricks to at least minimize it?,Anxiety

51926,Where do I begin to get help? I'm a 27 year old female. I've probably had anxiety all my life but have never spoken to a doctor or anyone about it. I feel like im just always in a constant state of worry. So much so that it drives me to have small OCD traits. Something as simple as fearing a house fire and having to do a series of steps checking lights before I leave the house. Over and over......and over again. It's weird. I'm always worrying about the future past things I can't change things I say or do after im with people how people view me if I have a too much gene. I'll sit and agonize over things that's so mild for someone to worry about but drives me up a wall. To the point of frustration where I just lose it and cry into a panic. I dont even know where to start to solve this. I feel like the past year it's been horrendous and getting increasingly worse. I'm good at playing it off. I'm good at putting on a show because I've always thought I could handle it lots of people I know feel the same. But it's really starting to take a toll on my life and the things I'm doing or too afraid to even try to do.I feel like I use alcohol and drugs as a way to cope sometimes. Not an outrageous amount but I'll have a big drinking night and then will go a week without drinking cause I've worried myself into thinking I have a problem and need self control. I'm so good at people pleasing and acting like everything is fine but I feel like my mind is just in a dark place. Telling myself I'll never make it that I'll always be alone etc.It's really stupid things to stress over. Or at least stupid things to let myself worry about for more than a minute. Money is always a bug stress factor for everyone of course but thats the main reason I think I've never gone to get help. I'm not sure how much it cost to afford the help I need or where to even go. Not to mention the fear I get trying to explain how I feel to someone and them thinking I'm crazy or I'm making it up how sad to think a professional in this field would judge me....I just feel like if I dont try to improve my overall mindset towards life then I wont have a fulfilling one. I'll be too afraid to try new things that scare me I'll stick to my same safe routine and I'll come home and cry over the big and small worries that run through my head daily. Where I do I start to fix this...?,Anxiety
51927,People often say Really? when I tell them I have anxiety and I have mixed emotions about it. On the one hand its comforting to know that all of my worries about coming across as nervous or awkward are so out of proportion that people dont even know I have anxiety. On the other hand it feels sort of invalidating to my struggle if that makes sense. This thing often consumes my life and its frustrating that no one knows how hard Im trying. They just think this is easy for me that I can effortlessly raise my hand and speak in class like other people do. Thats not to say that I feel negatively toward the people who say this more that its just generally frustrating that people have no idea. Have yall thought about this too? Do you look at it a different way?,Anxiety

51929,Im dating someone I really like and its absolutely killing me A bit of background I was diagnosed with ocd and gad about 15 years ago. Been very much under control for the most part. Im 32 years old and just started dating an incredible 31 year old woman about a month ago. Ive dated a lot over the past few years but this is the first time in ages where Ive REALLY been into the person. Normally it feels like the people I date like me more than I like them and anxiety doesnt play a role. I just go about my day with a calm mind and do what needs to be done. But now it feels like the roles are reversed and Im getting crushed. Constant thoughts of whether or not she likes me obsessing over every word in her texts to try interpreting meaning freaking out if shes doesnt respond to my messages within a couple hours. Its taking over my life. My work is slipping I cant sleep well a constant awful sick panicked feeling in the pit of my stomach. It doesnt help that shes very reticent with her emotions and does not offer much words of affection or validation. But I dont want to scare her off with my intense feelings so on the surface Ive been playing it cool the best I can. I almost wish she would just end things with me so I could move on because not knowing how she feels is the worst part.I dont know what to do.,Anxiety
51930,Try to massage the back of your head with your palm and then concentrate on feeling it and imagine that you are thinking your thoughts and feeling feelings there. This technique helped me to develop awareness of my thoughts and feelings as observer. Also it helped me to heal my anxiety and neurosis. I call this Back of head method. I hope you try it and it works.If your attempt was successful and you started feeling calmness and ease i recommend you to regularly practice this method for months to get good results. You wont even recognize your reaction to impulses after long practice.,Anxiety

51932,Im Afraid My Mom Might Hurt Me So the preface Im someone in my early twenties living with my parents. My parents have been fighting for years occasionally physically. This would usually include my mom knocking in my dads door to argue with him. These arguments would usually start with topics that included bills taxes or myself that would eventually escalate to more personal matters I will not get into too much here. I used to try to intervene when things got too heated since they cant stop themselves but recently I have decided not to so anymore as the last time I tried to intervene my mom did physically attack me I didnt get hurt I was just standing in front of my dad and she lurched at me.Last night she called me to ask if I could knock on my dads door since he wasnt responding to her calls because she needed to pay a bill. I knew that this wasnt just about a bill so I compromised and sent him a text instead I even sent her a screenshot as proof. And I wasnt going to call himwake him up in the middle of the night unless it was an emergency as I would consider it to be rude to do so. She then says dont worry your little head about go back to sleep or whatever okay? Then she called me again this time saying What are the consequences gonna be? Knock on the fucking door. I declined saying I dont want to be a part of whatever was going on between them and she should talk to him about this to which she said I know. Hes your loving dad and Im the evil mom. I said goodnight to her she laughs and responded with not goodnight. Good bye. I say that I will talk to her tomorrow and she replies Ill never talk to you again. Not tomorrow not the next day or the next.She then calls me twice then immediately hangs up. She calls me one more time that night here are the things she said when I declined to knock on my dads door againI ask you to do one simple thing and you didnt do it. Its just a simple thing! I tried calling your dad and he isnt answering me. Its not like youre picking sides or anything! Translation Look at what I do for you! And yet you cant this simple task for me? Well then I will rescind my love for you!Its not like youre picking sides or anything!Youre full of shit just like him my dad.Where has your dad been all of your life?You need to take responsibility.Is this what one of your councilors told you to say the one that I pay x amount of money I dont exactly remember.You dont even know what is going on.But fine. You can do whatever go to sleep wake up in the morning do whatever you do.Me ok. Goodnight mom.And finally I said goodnight to her and she said Dont call me mom. Just say good night.Thats not to say my dads innocent either or anything hes hella toxic and has treated my mom poorly as well so it is hard to tell where the abuse and victimization starts and ends between the two of them. Basically theyre both each others abusers and victims if that makes any sense at all. But I do believe he is the safer parent as although he can at his worst make me feel very uncomfortable to be around him as he is kind of an asshole at times I dont feel like my safety is threatened around him unlike with my mom. Hes a lesser of two evils if you will.So I just feel really anxious right now. I did not want to be used as a pawn against dad and my mom immediately associated me with him. So now Im afraid that when she comes home she will start to treat exactly like she treats dad or worse. Im afraid she might start pounding my door and attacking verbally and physically. Okay that is all I just needed to vent. Thank you for reading this.,Anxiety
51933,Something is wrong with me... Trigger warning I'm becoming numb and I don't feel like talking to anyone. I'm not diagnosed with anxiety but I know I have it. Even being aware I don't feel better. It sucks. I'm a good person. I don't say that a lot but I am. Why is this happening to me? Overthinking every stupid thing nailbiting the constant hatred for myself and others. It doesn't help. As a kid I've always known that something is wrong with me. But I'm too scared to tell my parents because if it's confirmed it means I'm sick. I am not okay and I want help. But I'm so used to being the person who helps not being helped. I always put on a fake smile and am never in a bad mood no one suspects it.I feel so alone. I should be used to it but ever since I've got friends I want to spend time with them. It doesn't help because we have a huge fight and I keep overthinking it. I wanted to feel better because I somehow convince myself my feelings are fake and that I'm doing it for attention. So I took a pathology test and the result was too much for me. The questions felt so attacking and my stomach hurt every time I clicked a yes or a no. The result was that it is 90 sure I have anxiety. My stomach dropped seeing that. While I was happy I was right at some point I felt retarded. That realization that is actually something wrong with me was horrifying. I don't mean to degrade anyone but I felt horrible.,Anxiety

51938,Scared to ask mom for things because of judgement Ok so kinda a weird post and Im not sure if it belongs here but I figured this sub was probably the best one for it. I also tried the social anxiety sub but my post was instantly removed. So basically I have this huge fear of asking my mom for things because I think she will judge me for them. I dont have this fear around anyone else I couldnt care less what anyone else thinks of me but for some reason I have it with her. Im not talking about little things like asking for something at the store or asking for basically any necessity. Im talking about bigger things like hair dye piercings or really anything to do with clothing. For example recently I worked up the confident to ask her over text if I could dye my hair which she is fine with however later that day when she asked me to show her pictures of what I want I chickened out and got to scared to show her. Its like I knew she would say yes but I was still to scared to show her because I was afraid shed say something judgmental to me. She has always been sorta judgmental towards me but I really want to get over this fear because it prevents me from getting a lot of the things I really want. Is there anything I can do?,Anxiety
51939,I had a mini win ! Hello everyone I hope youre okay. I was just playing FIFA and boom a big palpitation hit I started to panic felt lightheaded because I was holding my breath because I was so tense and then calmed down. I have had my heart checked 7 times 2 of which are private best testing ones and its perfect so I know its not going to harm me but still catches me off guard I think its more of the fact I was leaning forward that it felt harder and the fact I was breathing in lol. Anyway ! I was laying in bed thinking I need to just once and for all get over all of the symptoms that are making me scared of being Ill and dying. How can I do that ???? GET OVER MY FEAR OF DYING now Im not saying Im perfectly fine with death because I am not but I just thought to myself I cant stop death and I just need to accept it. If there isnt a god I wont know about dying after if there is a God I could go to heaven which is great and who knows I could reincarnate and live life again. We dont know so its the anxiety of not knowing which scares me and leaving my family behind. Like I say Im a healthy 22 year old male with NO health conditions death can happen at anytime and could happen the next minute but for my age and health it is unlikely but never zero. Now Im religious and I am sort of anxious in my mind that God is trying to get me to accept death so I can die soon lol but I dont wanna die soon thats why Im scared off. Thats just my anxious mind thinking right ? I guess the positive way of looking at it is that God is getting me to get over my fear of death so I can live the LONG HAPPY HEALTHY LIFE that he put out for me. Can anyone help me accept death even more ?,Anxiety

51941,27 yo with severe anxiety living with parents fails at life Hey ranxiety I am in a very tough spot rn i was working towards becoming a teacher for 7 years started my teaching certification programme in my country you need to do this but after 3 weeks I was so anxious of all the people i constantly had to deal with that i started suffering from constant belly pain diarrhea insomnia. So after spending 4 weeks on sick leave i decided i want to quit and try to focus on my mental health first and maybe find a small job like a 10 h job in order to be slowly introduced into regular work life while getting support from therapy and social services the 10 h job idea was from my therapist because i havent had a job except for a summer job when i was 18 which was very traumatic because the boss constantly berated me made fun of me and humiliated me.I still live with my parents who have financially supported me throughout my studies tho till i was 25 my health insurance was free and they got tax benefits and child benefits from me still living with them if i had moved out i would have been entitled to support by them my divorced father had to pay me 112 a month for instance and to them me quitting because i just can't work with children and a ton of colleagues and the constant stress of being judged and evaluated and dealing with maladjusted kids supposedly is understandable. However they demand of me to immediately get a fulltime or 30 hour job so i can move out ASAP in potentially a field i have little experience in and they say i shouldnt become unemployed and rely on social services because it would look bad on my CV.Because i was struggling to find a field that would interest me within a week of deciding to quit teaching and me offering to apply for a 10 h job at a library smth i wanted to do before but my applications failed sadly as a transitionary period my mother basically screamed daily at me the last couple days saying i should get a job and gtfo and stop acting like a child when i started crying shaking and feeling like i was about to throw up. She says she is entitled to her financial support paying off after all this time and that i should get a job like a normal person and support myself. As a result of this constant yelling and screaming and ranting i havent been able to sleep for days i have lost 3 kg of weight lack any appetite have to get up every night cus of diarrhea and havent slept more than 3 hours most nights. Yday i proposed the idea with the 10 hour job and my mother reacted as if i was telling her a bad joke and said i should be ashamed for even suggesting such a thing. In her rage she said i should gtfo she doesnt care if it's social housing or a homeless shelter and that she didnt financially support me to become a workshy leech. So in my panic i phoned a bunch of social services just in case so i would know my options. Today she came in tears to me and said she was just very concerned about my future. Yday I talked to my doctor and my therapist about the potentiality of getting kicked out and they asked if i could go somewhere to get away from this situation so i can recover a bit like i was supposed to during my sick leave so i decided today to leave for my boyfriend's place who is still a student and also lives with his parents but in a different country we are in EU so travelling is no problem. I have some money left from my teaching job that i could give them if they ask for it i was paying my fam 250 a month from the teacher pay so i wouldnt be freeloading while i stay there. I have been taking Sertraline Zoloft for a few weeks now but have had very little success. I have been in therapy since november and been on sick leave since late february. I think if i had stayed i would have become suicidal as i was noticing myself starting to go numb and dissociate whenever i was being yelled at. After explaining my situation to my doctor she said she couldnt let me leave without asking if i have sucidial thoughts because in that case she would have recommended sending me to a clinic.Some questions are plagueing me now however... am i a coward? Am i doing the right thing? Am i a lazy leech like my parents call me or just too mentally ill to work a proper job for now?What do you guys think about my situation am i doing the right thing? What should i have done in your opinion? Kind of asking as a reality check,Anxiety

It feels like hell because its hard enough to put myself out there in the first place.Its not even just deep stuff.

51943,Is this disassociation? For the past couple months now Ive been having this weird feeling in my body like my mind and and my body are on a different course like my movements are almost robotic and my mind is losing control of my body. Ik people typically associate this with dissociation but I still feel in control and recognize and Im mindful of the fact that I am the one controlling my movements but idk its hard to explain it just feels like a lack of connection between the two and at certain times its so bad I feel Im just going to lose control of my body completely. Ive also been experiencing some feelings of being off balance muscle tension headaches RLS and brain fog and Im starting to wonder if my fears really are anxiety or something worse. I saw a doctor and she told me it is probably stress related but Im just having a hard time with all of this Im seeing neurologist later this month but I just feel so restless and like Im living in agony and losing my mind I wanted to see if anyone has gone through something similar and can offer any advice Thanks.,Anxiety
51944,Am I being too hard on myself? I'm putting myself through a university undergraduate degree as a mature student 25 and I just had my grades improve over the last two semesters. But this semester... My father in law had emergency surgery in January. I got approved for breast reduction surgery in February and had it done March 21st this past Tuesday and now I have to drop 1 course out of 3 because I'm failing it and can't keep up it's an elective that's not in my field of study.I think the stress of that course will jeprodize my recovery but my stress isn't gone. Due to my Fs in that course I'm second guessing myself. I have an interview this coming Tuesday to be a research assistant and have to submit a writing sample and I feel inadequate. Even though I get really high marks on my papers in my field. I feel like I'm not allowed to be proud of myself. To be optimistic or excited. I feel like I have to be hard on myself instead of encouraging. I sound delusional asking if I'm being too hard on myself because I know the answer... But I can't let myself believe it.,Anxiety

At first I thought it was from weed and something called CHS but quitting weed didnt really make a difference. I also have delt with this vommiting in highschool before I would go to a party I would get so nervous I would puke. And that was before I ever touched weed.This led me to go to a gastro doctor who said he did not think it was weed related and instead some inflammation in intestines. Ive been on meds for that for 3 months but it was getting better and I really started to take my anxiety seriously so I went to my doctor and they prescribed me an SSRI. I also will start therapy in a few weeks here. For the past month after about 1.5 month on SSRI I have been doing better. I hadnt thrown up for a month but these past 2 nights I have had very panic attack like feelings and tonight even pushed me to the point where I had to get up from being comforted by my girlfriend to throw up. And I always feel awful about it and like its going to just keep happening and I think I get stuck in that cycle.Does anyone have any tipsadvice on dealing with this before my therapy appointment I thought I was doing so good but now Im afraid Im slipping back.,Anxiety
51948,Scared to start Lexapro I have a crippling anxiety disorder and Ive been prescribed Lexapro. I have GAD but Ive noticed my anxiety has always been around my health especially my heart. Its gotten so bad that I barely leave the house and Im afraid to exert myself which is depressing because I used to be a gym rat and exercising was what I used to do help cope with my anxiety but thats not something I can do anymore Atleast In my mind I cant. This has really intensified over this past year after dealing with multiple panic attacks that have landed me in the ER and Ive been getting a bunch of physical symptoms constantly that does not help with my worrying. Ive had many tests done and the doctors are very reassured that Im healthy. My Doc believes the Lexapro will help me but I cant seem to find the courage to take it. Im just so terrified of it Id really appreciate some encouragement to start my meds because I high key hate living like this .,Anxiety
51950,A reminder that progress isn't linear and that's okay! I felt like my anxiety had gotten worse lately and that I had gone backwards. This made me feel extremely discouraged and a sense of doom until I saw this quote. I wanted to share in hopes that it will help others too. Don't be so harsh on yourself anxiety is a curse that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy if I had any lol Take care x,Anxiety
51951,Tips on how to accept my symptoms are just anxiety and start living again?? The last month has been such a struggle for me. I started having panic attacks where my heart rate would spike to 150180. I went to my doctor in case it wasnt anxiety and just had my Holter Monitor results come back. I had one of these attacks while on it and thankfully no dangerous rhythms were found. Just some high rates but not sustained so my doctor is unconcerned. So once again this is all anxiety. My therapist thinks its because I started a new job last month and Im falling back into my old health anxiety habits because Stress compounds symptoms. This has gotten so bad that the past week I havent even been able to leave my bed out of fear of my heart getting too high. Due to probably the fear when I cooked or did dishes my heart rate could get up to 130 then if I noticed and began to worry it went up to 160.Now that I know Im fine I thought Id be okay but Im still constantly watching my smart watch to see how high my heart rate gets then panicking when I see it go above 120 from just walking around the house but when Im calm it doesnt go over like 110. This happened on the Holter and it was normal. I know this is just anxiety but I cant stop obsessing that I have a heart issue thatll kill me. I just need help to take the smart watch off and stop taking my blood pressure. Its just making everything worse. Yesterday alone according to my logs I took my blood pressure 50 times. I was worried because my bp was low when standing yet my heart rate was high so I thought it was dangerous. It happened again this morning and my heart rate got to 165. This constant checking is driving me crazy and ruining my life. How do I stop this??,Anxiety

51954,Health anxiety i've noticed that over the last year i've become super anxious when it comes mine and my loved ones health i think it's because my husband had bells palsy early last year. Since then anything will trigger me!! literally anything. I was picking at a mole didnt realize and it started bleeding and got itchy and now I have this anxious feeling in my stomach even tho i know IM the one who picked at it. I feel like even though my brain is like yes u picked at u probably dont have anything to worry about that anxious feeling in my stomach is still there.Other times if i have a headache it goes to the worst outcome. I make doc appts every so often but I also don't want to be that person who shows up so frequently for nothing and waste my docs time. Im really starting to feel hopeless and like Im going to live with this anxious feeling forever. I guess.. any advice?,Anxiety
51955,is it normal for an SSRI to make you feel like you're literally dying I was prescribed 50 mg Zoloft for anxiety and depression which I took for the first time last night. What followed was the most excruciatingly painful and unbearable 12 hours of my life. I threw up anything I ate heart was pounding nonstop my entire body was numb and I couldn't sleep without being constantly woken up by stomach pain or nausea. Pretty much all the anxiety symptoms I normally get except all at once and multiplied 100x. At certain points I honestly felt like I was about to die or pass out.I know people say that it gets worse before it gets better but nothing could have prepared me for this. I don't think I'm gonna take another dose until I can talk with my psychiatrist and be absolutely certain this won't happen again. Anyone else have a similar experience or am I just really fucking unlucky,Anxiety
51956,I am feeling anxious about a new coworker. TW Past experience with a stalker briefly mentioned I'm sorry but this is a long one. It's a bit of a weird story but I'm hoping that someone might be able to give me advice on what to do. Just over a month ago I female cashier got a new coworker male bagger at the grocery store I work at. It took a while before we had a conversation together he was helping me and asked me what kind of music I like. I was honest and said that I like most genres and that I sometimes enjoyed listening to 20s and 30s jazz music. Then he just kept talking about old music at me for the next few days and seemed to always be distracted when it came to work. I don't like to talk much while I'm working because I feel like I mess up more when I do. So I began to feel anxious about being around him since I didn't know how to tell him I didn't want the conversation to continue every time we saw each other.Then a few days ago he randomly asked me for my number in front of a bunch of customers while we were supposed to be working. I had a bad experience the last time I gave my number out to someone the guy turned out to be a stalker who harassed me for weeks and told everyone that we were in a relationship when we weren't wouldn't stop calling me tried to turn me against my family etc. and I immediately felt freaked out about why this guy would want my number when we don't know each other at all. It felt really inappropriate and unprofessional to me. I told him that we were busy and shouldn't be having that conversation right then mainly because I didn't know how to say no in the moment and that we could talk when we were done helping customers. But he continued to ask me repeatedly for throughout the next hour or so. He ended up writing his number down at some point and gave it to me telling me when he was off that day and to immediately text him my number when he was off this is while I was talking to a customer. Once we were done with all of the customers I told him the truth that I didn't want to give him my number and how I had had bad experiences in the past that started with giving my number to a guy I barely knew. He seemed to understand and then avoided me the rest of the day. So I thought everything was going to be fine.However the next day I started noticing that he seemed to be getting more clingy with me. He wouldn't be focused on doing his job and would stick around me as much as possible. He has a habit of sticking to my register instead of helping other cashiers like he's supposed to he also seems to get bothered if another bagger is helping me and he tries to take over bagging for me immediately. I often notice him watching me from across the room. Every conversation we have is awkward. I don't initiate them because I want him to leave me alone so I can work. When he's not talking to me it seems like he isn't really talking to our other coworkers that much.But then the other day I had a bit of a scary experience. I was going on break and went to our break room. He was in there and had headphones in so I didn't think he saw me. After a few minutes I went to the bathroom across the hall. When I came out a few minutes later the room was empty. I suddenly hear loud footsteps running down the hall and he barges into the room halfyelling my name just to show me a song from the 1800s for some reason. I'm worried that he might have been waiting outside the bathroom for me which makes me kind of scared to be at work right now. I don't like being alone with him. Today I spent the majority of my breaks hiding in the bathroom worried he might bother me if I went anywhere else.I know that the anxiety I feel isn't healthy and I can't tell if I'm just paranoid from past experience or if there really could be a real issue here. I don't know if I should talk to him a manager or HR about this. I thought that maybe I should just say nothing and act less nice to him and see if he leaves me alone but I'm worried that it could just make things worse. I could really use some advice if anyone has some. Because I really can't tell if he's just trying to be friendly and doesn't realize he's making me uncomfortable or if there is something potentially more creepy going on.,Anxiety
51957,I am having a extremely large amounts of anxiety for a person. I 17F am in my senior year of high school. Ive sort of always been anxious especially about people. Any time ANYTHING happens to someone I care about even a little bit I get such bad anxiety that I am often unable to focus on other things. So as I said in high school. When I first started high school life was a mess. Whats important to know is that I had just made a massive transition and had come out of the closet. Not a lot of support from family but thats okay.In my particular HS we have a home room class and you have that teacher for home room for all 4 years. When I met my home room teacher she was incredibly kind. For all 4 years she continued to be this way. She made cards for everyone birthday talked to me when I was rejected romantically for the first time and always listened. We talked to each other while getting ready for the day nearly every day for the last two years. This week shes been absent. Very strange. Then on Wednesday she says in a slide prepared for the sub that shes out on medical leave for the next few weeks. It wasnt planned you could tell from the way she talked in the slides of the previous days. I find out that shes in the hospital but fine. INSTANTLY Im full of anxiety feeling like my soul was removed from my body. Im just worried like a lot. I KNOW shes fine as far as everyone knows. I also led an effort for a Get Well Soon card being given to her by another teacher shes friends with. I dont really know how to just patiently wait for the 34 weeks until she gets back. Id also like to say that I KNOW shes fine. My brain does not seem to feel the same way especially when Im not actively doing something distracting.TLDR my teacher is sick and in the hospital and I have a strangely large amount of anxiety even though everyone says shes fine.,Anxiety

51959,I am sad that a teenager blocked me from viewing his story. I 23F have a pretty okay relationship with my boyfriend's 24M family. His mom is a devote Christian and her and I are pretty close and his brother let's call him Jake and I are okay as well.ampx200BI follow the little brother who is 16 on Instagram and we occasionally interact liking stories picsetc. Yesterday I remembered that my friends and I created a 'burner' account 3 years ago that we used to look and follow people we didn't know crazy I know. ampx200BAnyways I noticed that Jake was following this burner. I looked at his profile as saw a bunch of stuff posted that I have never seen before. It was typical teenage boy stuff like rap music middle fingers in pictures etc. but nothing that I haven't seen before. I realized that I was blocked from viewing these stories and unblocked whenever he posted other stuff. I instantly started to feel sick and uneasy at the thought him blocking and unblocking me each time. I even felt a little teary. I thought does he think I am uncool? Old? Did he think I was going to tell his mom? I also post things with cursing etc. so I really felt confused. I know in reality it is really not that deep because I too have older adults in my life 'blocked' from viewing my story but the feeling I felt was uncontrollable. I don't want to feel like this anymore. I have felt similar to this in other occasions and another user asked if I had rejection sensitive dysphoria. I am not sure if I do. ampx200BTLDR Boyfriend's little brother blocked me from viewing his story and I instantly started to feel uneasy.,Anxiety

51961,College Student w Anxiety Dating Life I first developed severe anxiety and panic disorder in my senior year of high school. I can proudly say that with perseverance proper medication and the help of my lovely therapist family and friends I was able to complete my senior year and begin college in the fall. Ive taken a liking to this guy in my class and we will hang out this weekend. I am very inexperienced in the dating world as Ive only really gone out with three guys ever none of which lasted more than a few months. Though I had not been diagnosed with anxiety in my sophomore year of high school I began dating this guy whom I was pretty infatuated with. However the first time he put his arm around me I shook uncontrollably. I misread that as a sign that he wasnt suitable for me when it was just anxiety. Fast forward to now I am anxious about seeing this guy this weekend and I am scared that these feelings of fear wont go away even if we continue to see each other. Has anyone else been through this? What should I do? I dont want to be limited from dating but l my body is giving me unclear signals of what to do.,Anxiety

51963,Oh anxiety you are weird sometimes. 6 to 7 years ago I was diagnosed with GADPTSD. 2 years ago I was diagnosed with adhd. I have managed it all this time with no medicine and I have been fine with for the most part. The only time my anxiety would rise a little bit is when it was triggered by stress. Which then I knew I just had to balance it out again.Well this month ended up with heighten anxiety due to an allergic reaction being around seafood one week later got a tooth pulled 2 days later I was fussed at by an ER doctor and then one week later after that I had anxiety reflux kick back so hard that it cause two days of back to back panic attacks. My anxiety was so bad that I couldnt eat anything but rice and chicken no meds and being around doctors frighten me. I couldnt manage to get myself out of that anxiety loop. Well I was finally about to get some hydroxyzine for as needed dosage 3 weeks later. My anxiety was down back to a manageable level but my fears were still there. I took one 25 mg pill in the evening. I got an euphoria feeling and drowsiness the whole next day along with diarrhea. Then all my anxiety was gone. I can eat food again without fear. Im not scared to take meds again. This is the weirdest Anxiety is the moment I have ever dealt with. However Im now pondering if with my anxiety reflux being kicked up it had my stomach and brain a relay lap so when I took the hydroxyzine it suppressed that nerve in my stomach and it help my stomach feel better and then which stop the relay cycle. I guess that is something I will have to remember to ask my doctor.,Anxiety
51964,Health anxiety Zoloft side effects? I went off anxiety medication 8 months ago. Cut it cold turkey by accident I was never told otherwise. Thankfully had no withdrawals or anything. I have severe severe severe health anxiety and I was doing really good up until a few months ago it started to get bad again but I was managing. However the past 2 weeks have been really really hard with my health anxiety and I knew I needed to finally get back on and Im so happy to be back on. I had some stomach issues and Im freaking out. I had blood in my stools and bad pains in my pelvis. I also for the past 2 months have had a dull ache in my upper left abdomen. Had some blood and stool tests and all was good. Today is day 2 is taking my medication Zoloft and I have a weird nauseating feeling in my throatchest. It feels exactly like when you get super giddy and your chestthroat squeals with excitement. But I dont feel excited I feel so anxious. Its almost like I have to gag or dry heave. Can the Zoloft be causing this? I had no side effects last time I was on it so its weird. My anxiety is going crazy because Im afraid it has to do with my other symptoms.,Anxiety

51968,Actually you're a total badass Most people are mentally and emotionally sane relatively at least. They might claim that the worry is all in your head not understanding that your corporeal experience strongly suggests otherwise. They might tell you to think positive because they don't have an inner voice that constantly gets drowned out by a huge stadium packed with negative objectors. They might take it rather personally when socializing is the very least thing you want to do they could never imagine that them yapping on about their normal life drains your already depleted lifeenergy. Some of them might start all kinds of shit with you because they see you as a weak and opportune victim to unload their own shit towards never realizing they're the real cowards.Some of them might truly want to help you out and tell you get therapy asap then you might see some random bureaucrat person completely devoid of empathy struggling to stay awake while you pour you heart of desperately looking for some kind of assistance. Assistance that usually comes in form of dubious drugs that only work at a hefty price by the way So they advice you to go see some private expensive experts unaware of the fact that your wallets suffers with you. They like to imply that you just chill the f out and relax. Because they don't have that intrusive horrible horrible horrible encompassing joydevouring soulobliterating sucking painful torturous uneasy pit of dread stuck right in their stomach with racing thoughts to boot. Perhaps they'll make sly remarks on how you need to just grow up after all they don't know how's it's like to think like an adult while emotionally reacting like a little fragile child scared to death.They might say go the gym or be physically active and get some endorphins running. To be fair is actually solid advice if you can muster the strength to go there. Off course they have their problems too the difference however is that your problem is you and how that you contaminate every aspect of your life. The point is according to some of 'them' you're just a loser useless lazy afraid a waste of space a failure with nothing to show for in life. They are so much better than you and intentionally or not they make you buy their version of you.However. It's just opinions from judgemental people at the end of the day. I don't want to you to waste any energy on harboring any resentment envy or anger towards anybody they just don't understand. How could they know the truth. Perhaps even you don't the truth about yourself so I'm going to say it just in case.You simply being here and keeping on makes you a tough as nails. A warrior that fights hordes of demons every day. Bravery is defined by the will to face fear you have fear stuffed in your face all the time. You may suffer endless anxiety but you as a matter of fact are courageous by the definition of the word. Doing your best to just keep going that's it. It's not some lofty motivational speech just a cold fact.It may not help you any bit to read this but I for one will not let it be unsaid. Anxiety is bad enough in itself so rather than feeling shame in addition you have earned the right to have pride in yourself. My intention is for you to keep that in mind on your darkest days because I know very well what it's like to suffer anxiety while having your character measured by factors out of your control.,Anxiety

51970,Is it anxiety and over thinking? Or is it intuition? How to know the difference? My partner has lied to me in the past and now anything that is remotely close to that topic makes me think hes lying. And then I spiral and think I have to check his phone then I think he deleted messages then I need to check his Apple Watch and then I think he may have used another form of contact and I start to feel like maybe Im being illogical and crossing the line. In the moment I feel like nothing can give me relief except for finding solid proof. Im not proud of this behavior. I recently started therapy for my overall anxiety. Unfortunately it is hard to afford to have sessions often enough. Context He lied 1.5 years ago about something relating to a female coworker it was not infidelity. After lying he was able to prove he was telling the truth. I feel 99 confident about it. Since then he lied about about small things like not playing video games while on the phone. Idk I dont want to damage my relationship with this but I also dont want to be lied to again and turn a blind eye. So how can I know if I am acting because of anxiety and overthinking opposed to following intuition and following my gut. My intuition is how I caught his initial lie.,Anxiety
51971,Blood pressureHeartrate First time posting here. For context I suffer with anxiety obviously and also have bipolar and OCD parents. I find myself constantly obsessing over high blood pressure and high BPM. I'm a heavy set guy. I'm trying to be healthier but I have a long way to go on that. Sometimes hours of my day are spent stressing over whether my heart rate is too high and when I do so I find it usually makes it go higher. I hate going to the doctor because of it because I know my BP will be high and I don't want to know how high. Today I had to go to the doctor and ofc it was high but I was also having a panic attack while they were checking it because of the nerves I have around the whole thing and already had to walk 3 miles just to get there. I wasn't even there over my blood pressure. Anyway after the visit I was sobbing and hyperventilating the whole way home. I just don't know what to do. Obviously I have to get it under control but in the meantime I need to find some way not to obsess over it because it keeps triggering panic attacks.,Anxiety

51976,Story About the time my teacher made me stand up to show my red face to show the class when I was emmbaressed So it was my biology class and it was one of those classes where I had none of freinds in and was extremely uncomfortable every lesson because alot of the time we were made to answer questions infront of the class or have to find partners and obviously me being awkward and with social anxiety I never j never had a partner.And because of this I always would get a red face from embarrasment and I guess she took notice because the time we we learning about why the face goes red she decided to ask me a question about it knowing my face would go red and once it did she said oh look it's happening now which obviously made it 10x worse and she littarly made me stand up and face the class it was one of the worst days of my school life.In her defence she was older and I doubt she evain knew how painful that was for me to do that but yeah just a random story I doubt anyone read this far lol.,Anxiety

51978,Why can't I believe what the doctors tell me? I 26 M am super frustrated with myself today I had a cardiologist appointment bc I have palpitations sometimes and my heart races randomly when I have acid reflux. The cardiologist did some blood pressurepulse checks to rule out POTS and said I was fine on that front. The EKG came back great and he said my heart was in excellent shape. I even asked him to order a take home monitor for me just for some peace of mind and he was ok with that. I had an echocardiogram done about 1 year ago with a different cardiologist and everything came back great. Now as I get home from the doctor my anxious brain gets to plotting and is now worrying that He didn't order you another echocardiogram what if he's missing something. My rational brain believes and trusts this doctor very much but the anxiety part of my brain just wants to create more worry for any reason it can find. Can anyone give me some advice or insight? Is there even any Medical reason I would need a second echocardiogram 1 year later? I assume it detects defects that have been there probably from birth so a second one is probably pointless but it's hard to tell my anxious brain that. I Just want to believe the doctors when they give me positive news and believe that I'm fine.Edit I should note I am very aware that I have health anxiety and I am currently in therapy for it already It still bugs me though.,Anxiety

51984,stress ate and now i feel really poorly. anyone have tips on soothing the aches and nausea? Just in case anyone needs a TW there is talk of medicationand in advance i'm sorry for any spelling errorsampx200Bwasnt feeling well at all and started stress eating. i tried my stratergies that i do with my psychologist but today was just one of those days if you get what i mean.i've eaten too much but a majority of what i've eaten is sugar which also gives me headaches when i eat a lot of it also in case this is needed information i dont get sugar high.idk if i can take nurofen or panadol Panadol is a paracetamol i think and i think nurofe contains ibprofen for the headache because i'm on ritalin methylphenidate and Movox Fluvoxamine i think its called something else in america though and most people on reddit seem to be from the US and idk if some pain killers are compatable with ritalin or movox.im also on a birth control to manage my periods its called Evalyn i think im spelling it right idk the science medication name off the top of my head though but i know i can take pain killers with my BC. however it does cause mild indigestion. i though it'd be good to include this because the intestines and stomach are connected lol. the queasy feeling is really bothering me and i feel sickly. does anyone have any tips on what i can do to ease it? ive drank lots of water both for the stomach ache queasiness and for the headache and have my big water bottle next to me in case i need more but it hasnt helped. just looking at anything food related is making me feel like im gonna throw up too. i've thought of sleeping it off but i struggle to nap during the day and i've already slept in a ton this morning so my body doesnt feel sleepy at all i've tried putting ASMR on too but that isnt making me sleepy.would really appreciate if anyone knows how to help this. i might try looking more into wether i can safely take some pain killers or not using reliable sources so that i can make sure i'll be safei'm also gonna ask on a medical related subreddit if i can take ritalin and movox with pain killers at the same time because it's really hard to find information online on my own.thank you to anyone who reads this and thank you to anyone who can help means a lot to me,Anxiety
51985,Anxiety and Weed Hi looking for a bit of advice and experiences from ranxiety here.Around Christmas I started to develop some kind of anxiety disorder and had a lot of panic attacks. For most of my life I've always been a little anxious and tended to overthink but these symptoms were just much worse. Up to this point I've also been smoking weed but not excessively mostly once a week. After developing said disorder weed now increases my symptoms despite it never doing something like this before and it mostly calming me down. Even when I had a greenout I mainly suffered physical symptoms. In response to my symptoms I started with autogenic training a lot of introspection about my fears and stopped smoking for about a month. With this I got the worst of it under control. Since then I've been smoking a few times with mixed results sometimes I get more anxious and panicky but on other occasions it also felt like a normal high. Right now I still have some lingering symptoms that can be better or worse depending on the day so I'll definitely quit weed until I can resolve this. My question now is if any of you here have suffered something similar and were you eventually able to smoke without getting anxious again? I'll be honest I quit enjoyed being high so that would be quite the bummer but certainly not the end of the world.Thanks in advance!,Anxiety

51989,Anticipatory anxiety ruined my chance at a vacation. I'm so tired of trying to fly and failing. 28M.I've had a lifelong fear of flying that feel wellprepared to take headon especially the fear I've had around taxiing and takeoff. I've flown before but it's gotten harder to get through the process without running out of the airport dizzy panicked and overwhelmed by guilt in the past few years.Specifically I took a program called SOAR designed to help fearful flyers manage their fightflight responses around takeoff and aviophobia or fears when the plane is in the air. I felt confident in the last few weeks that I could do this. But as I lay on my side writing this I realize I was completely unprepared for the anticipatory anxiety ahead of the flight.I woke up at 4 am this morning in a cold sweat. My extremities were numb. I couldn't get a 10minute patch of sleep in without my stomach seemingly twisting into knots. The last 17 hours has been a waking nightmare of existing in a moderate to strong panic attack state. My appetite is nonexistent. I'm barely able to drink water. Every nerve in my body is screaming at me to tell my friends that I can't go on the spring break trip we planned.It's crazy I'm a grad student and I have never felt as tired as I do now just spending this day holding myself back from tears and a full breakdown. I'm so tired that a beach doesn't sound nice right now. I just want to curl up in my bedroom with no direct sunlight to sleep to cry to indulge in selfhatred for having a response this extreme to something so commonplace in life for a lot of people. A vacation is the one thing I need right now but trying to take one via flying has destroyed me. I'm lucky that I had nothing to do today because it was not going to get done. I don't know if this thread is a message in a bottle but it helps to get it out. If anyone has been in a similar situation I'd love to hear it.I still want to fly deaparately. It's one of the big things keeping me from living my life on my terms. But having to spend almost 48 hours in utter hell is not worth it.,Anxiety
51990,My mom doesnt care anymore I 24M have been dealing with anxiety and treatment resistant depression for the past few years or so. Its gotten very bad and my mental health has deteriorated as the days go on. Ive started struggling with really bad brain fog and confusion and its really freaked me out lately. Ive been unable to work since mid last year and still live with my brother and mom. My dad moved about 30 mins away a year and a half ago after my parents got divorced but they stayed friends.The past few months have been hell dealing with the brain fog on top of the other issues and not being able to find a doctor to take me seriously. Im surely at a loss. My mom has began dating again and is legitimately obsessed with online dating. Buying every membership to every site imaginable talking to a different guy every night and most nights shes going out. Now this probably wouldnt bother me but when I have so much going on sometimes I just need someone to talk to. I was always extremely close to my mom she has always been there for me but lately she really doesnt even seem to care. Her only worry is that Im afraid youre going to hurt yourself but she doesnt want to do anything to help me. She told me this morning that she wants me to go stay with my dad and Im so hurt. Ive lived here for 24 years and I just want to feel clear headed again. Idk what to do and I feel like my parents hate me. I honestly feel like I have nobody.I do go out with friends a lot of nights or just hangout to get out of the house I workout so its not like Im just sitting at home waiting for her. But you cant even have a conversation with her without her staring at her phone. Ive honestly never seen anything like it and I cant imagine losing my parents emotionally. Im at a loss.,Anxiety

51992,Politics has made me anxious again I just want something to finally go right. Hello.So my country is going to have an election in the fall. Politics used to stress me out much more in the past I've since then cut a lot of the sites that were stressing me out and most days I feel pretty good and don't really worry about it that much. My country has been ruled by religious extremists who are incredibly bigoted for eight years now I'm so tired of their constant discriminatory comments blatant disregard for any sort of decency and integrity and they overall just make me so tired and anxious and sad. They've started to rule when I was a teen and I'm a young adult and they're still at the helm. It seems like they will win this year again and another even more extreme religious conservatist party has a chance at becoming the third biggest power.I fell into a mental hole and I can't get out of it. I know that the elections will be in the fall and it's early spring but I just feel so depressed and powerless. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to and that it will always just be horrible. I know that it's my brain making a bigger deal out of it than it should but I'm just so tired of it all can at least one thing go how I want politically?How do you deal with feelings like these?,Anxiety

51994,Are my antidepressants not working? Ive 22F have been on antidepressants since I was 14 but Ive never felt 100 better. I switched from Zoloft to Celexa about 2 years ago and Im currently taking the max dose of Celexa but I still get pretty bad bouts of depression and anxiety at least a couple of times per week. Im in therapy so I know of a variety of coping measures that I can take such as exercise journaling spending time with friendsfamily and breathing techniques but none of those things seem to work. I dont have any major problems or stressors in my life either Im just depressed for no reason 25 days per week.Does this mean that my antidepressants arent working or do I just kinda need to suck it up? Im scared to try new antidepressants bc of the withdrawals and potential worsening of my depression so Im not sure what the best thing for me is to do.,Anxiety

Especially after the exam is over I make scenarios in my head like Im going to fail or get accused of cheating by the monitor because they told me to stop talking twice. This time I forgot to write down the time I came back from the bathroom they have this paper we have to write when we left and came back from the room. Usually they write the time after we give ID but this time for some reason we had to do it all. I did write down the time I got out but I didnt write down the time I came back left twice and yup forgot twice. Usually we dont have to do this so thats why I forgot. Im worried this might get me in trouble because theres no way they can know the time I actually came back to the exam room ugh I know its dumb but dammit if they notice this it might actually get me in trouble ,Anxiety

52003,Is it AnxietyBurnout and why do my neckbackchest pains haven't stopped ever since august 2022 Disclaimer the post is slightly copy paste from this thread but I want to share this on many threads in order to get some help. I'm M 33years oldWhat's really interesting is every single described on this thread are almost identical to the ones I I have right now so if you can please check them out so you understand what I am going trough.httpswww.reddit.comrcostochondritiscommentsjrihv6chestpainformonthsnoanswers?xpromoedpenabled The only logical explanation I've found myself is that it might be severe Anxiety or Burnout I've experienced which makes my muscles being tense up all the time without me even realising it and get inflamed by the constant stress.As well some people from what I've googled claim that it might be side effect after a COVID infection around June 2022 but oddly enough my wife is totally fine despite both of us having similar symptoms while we were sick I got headaches and my throat hurt her throat hurt and she was tired both of us were 3x vaccinated. The only reason why I rule it out is because these pains did start 2 days after my bed broke down while I was lying on it August 2022 and we changed the bed mattress afterwards around october 2022 but we've slept on the couch that can be transformed into a bed which is literally a wooden plank with the old mattress on top of it that was way overdue had a hole in the middle so had to change it for almost 3 months.Before this all happend I was really really stressed for years because of tons of private issue that negatively impacted my mental health and I was inactive during the lock down 2020 and after losing my job june 2021 I've been almost every day on the PC with bad posture probably from 2019 June 2022. I got now a new job in september 2022 but got laid off from a previous one I was in for 3 months around January 2022Also I was on Amitriptyline 25mg for almost a year and stopped taking them as my neurologist told me back than June 2022 I used to have around 2021 iirc similar painstingles on the left side of my body but not like the ones I have right now.I do really hope if anyone finds out what we can do do finally feel better beside accepting our symptoms and live with them. I have the typical tingly electric feelings around my left side headaches migraines heart races burningcold feeling on one foot or both etc these symptoms typical come when I feel really anxious. Now all the symptoms seems to focus on ChestPainNeck Pain with Brain Fog with especially when the pains are strong.The only relief I've found was lying down tough sometimes I had moment where my back was blockedstiffed but just for a short time and after I moved a bit taking walks outside in the fresh air being distracted doing some stretching of the muscle where I have the pain. Yet what I hate is they all return. I've did the classic health anxiety attack routine going to many Doctors ER etc dozens of Bloodtest came fine have a slight Arthrosis and disc misplacement on my neck nothing seriously according to the doctors Neurologe didn't found any anomaly Cardio doctor in AugustSeptember 2022 told me my heart is totally fine we did a stress test on a bike So in the end I really hope it's just my anxietyburnout as my doctors all say who gave me all these physical symptoms. All I want is that these pains finally stop! And if I did write many confusing things please tell me so I can clear it up. P.S. I wanted to add as well that I grew up with stress my whole life ever since my childhood and that even to this day I am really nervous and my fingers are always tremble I am now asking myself if my body decided to crack when I got into my 30s,Anxiety
52004,Rapid Heart Rate 24M 6 215 pounds I have what I believe to be anxiety disorder. I almost always have some sort of anxiety. Sometimes I feel a little cloudy and maybe even a bit u stable on my feet. The worst is when Ill be working doing something minimally exhausting but my heart rate will raise to over 120 and then the panic ensues. The rapid rate can last hours. Maybe I am a hypochondriac and the more I think and check my pulse the worse it gets. Does anyone else have this happen? I have asked my doctor for a referral to a cardiologist just to be sure. Im currently on no medication.,Anxiety

52006,Zoloft Postpartum Anxiety I am 3 months postpartum and my doctor just prescribed me Zoloft 25mg. I have been having horrendous anxiety and insomnia. I finally decided I needed to do something about it. I took my first dose last night and was shakey and nervous and couldnt sleep. So I took a hydroxyzine but that didnt really help. So today I decided to take it earlier to see if that will help. I took it at noon. I am feeling so awful. Having diarrhea which I guess I dont really care about. But I have a headache and am soooo foggy. Like I feel weird and out of it and so tired but at the same time nervous and amped and I know I wouldnt be able to sleep. Someone please tell me this gets better and its worth it. I cant seem to see the light at the end of the tunnel right now. I have a baby that I have to care for so i hate feeling like this.

52007,Advice greatly needed 26 year old female sorry for the long post Ive been on anti depressants for about the last 12 years of my life. I was always on 100 mg zoloft amp then switched to 20 mg lexapro in 2018 but went off of them for about 6 months in 2021 to try to live without them. At the end of those 6 months I started to get dizzy more often amp have what I can only describe as uncontrollable thoughts. Not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone but I just did not feel in control of my emotions and I felt like I was gonna lose my mind lol amp very depressed. So I got back on lexapro 20 mg amp after a few months I started to feel average at best but better than before. August 2022 I started to get brain zapsdizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start. I worked my way up to 75mg amp started to feel a lottttt better but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since. Very dizzy lots of anxiety amp panic attacks and the weird uncontrollable emotionsthoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since. It gets A LOT worse at night and thats when most of my issues arise.Within the last 6 months Ive seen an ear doctor to make sure I didnt have inner ear issues causing dizziness an eye exam I got a small prescription mostly for being on my phonecomputer or reading and I got an MRI done and saw a neurologist. All has always come back normal so Im thinking its a medication issue or lack of something. Im mostly looking for advice or comfort to make me feel better since Im not doing well lol.

52008,Panic Attacks Hi I've been having very bad anxiety attacks lately. I've been taking valium and it's helped but doesn't eliminate it. I've never had it sooooo bad. I also take olanzapine.

52012,Going to the cinema This is probably a very particular issue and Ive never really wanted to post about my anxiety but Ive led myself here anyway. After a weed induced panic attack about 5 months ago things have been pretty hellish for me. Ive got a painful feeling in my chest I would say the majority of the day anxiety of course every day. Now I love love LOVE films. I plan to go to college next year and study film. Ive wanted to become a director for years now. As youd imagine that requires me to be able to watch pretty much any kind of film whenever. But going to the cinema something I hold so close to my heart as being a place I used to love a place I would go to escape has become really difficult for me. I really struggle in the days leading up to going takes serious mental preparation. Ive been a total of 6 times in 2023 which to people who know me is simply unheard of. Im a big fan of the John Wick films and have plans to go see the 4th one tomorrow. Ive been waiting a long time to see it but I just cant see myself actually going out and seeing it. If youre aware of the John Wick films you know that theyre probably the most foot on the gas and brutal action films around. Which I feel is going to really freak me out. In my experiences of going to the cinema with anxiety Ive never had to leave the cinema. Im pretty uncomfortable being there but Ive never had to leave. I think that the main thing is the fear that this thing I love so much is being taken from me despite me having no evidence to support it. While Ive been able to push myself to go all the other times I just cant see it happening this time. I know its a lot of mental gymnastics but if anyone has ANYTHING to tell me at all Id really appreciate it.Thanks ,Anxiety
52013,The Rollercoaster ride of anxiety. Starts off slow maybe you don't notice then eventually starts going up and no matter how hard I try to meditate mindfulness and it slowly goes up until it peaks and I crash down. Then I'm okay for a day a week and start climbing again.

Even my mouth feels spicy and weird...I don't know is this really something anxiety can do?I don't feel sick at all but everything hurts like i'm in full on flu mode.Pretty much everyone on my mothers side of the family has rheumatism maybe it's finaly breaking out for me?Has anyone else felt like you usually do when you are just completely flu struck only that you aren't actually sick?Today was the first time i took a magnesium supplement 187 mg so maybe it has something to do with that?,Anxiety
52015,Magnesium for anxietyrelated heart palpitations? I have heart palpitations that Ive been to a cardiologist about for years and have always been told theyre just a result of anxiety. I hear of people having heart palpitations during panic attacks or while feeling anxious but I have them all day everyday no matter how calm or regular the moment is. I suppose underlying anxiety is still there as Im a jittery person naturally. But theyre annoying and distracting. I tried a beta blocker but it did absolutely nothing my cardiologist says anxiety meds might help but Im nervous to take any pills I dont have to.I heard magnesium helps with heart palpitations but I know nothing about it how much is good versus bad what form to take it in etc any info is appreciated! Anyone alleviate heart palpitations with magnesium? Id love to hear about your experience.,Anxiety
52016,Is it bad if your antidepressants makes you feel happy I'm not talking about dangerous mood elevation? I'm not talking about mania or hypomania here. But in the past I increased my escitalopram dose a few times. I was really climbing the ladder dosewise I think that I had to increase the dose over and over in order to keep the happy effect going so I had to quit and come back down to the proper dose. I felt unbelievably great as I increased the dose. I took notes on my experience and I was just saying how great I felt and how I had nice memories of my family and my past...my mood was just great.Antidepressants have been in use for a while now so I'm sure there's some wisdom about 1 whether being happy like that is sustainable 2 whether it's healthy or not and 3 whether I could've actually ended that phenomenon of chasing the effect up the dose ladder and gotten the effect to stick.Most importantly when the happy effect was in place all my ADHD medications were working. This was absolutely lifechanging. I can read in my notes that it says over and over if I could only maintain this level of healthy brainfunctioning and ADHDmedication effectiveness then I would have a great life. I wonder if there's anything to be learned from this whole experience that I had with the escitalopram and the ADHD medications maybe the experience can provide a clue as to what to try in order to have a sustainable foundation for my ADHD medications.I do have some anxietydepressionOCD I don't think that it's at the clinical level. I mean I looked up the criteria for OCD and one of them said something about the issues taking up an hour of your time each day so I'm far from that. And when it comes to depression and anxiety it's a situation where I have mild issues where you could probably say that it's unhealthy for me to have the negative tilt to my emotions that I have...again it's nothing clinical though.,Anxiety

52026,Does anyone feel anxiety because of some people? Sorry for the bad english or any grammar mistake D I've been dealing with my anxiety since I was 17. Since then I've been looking for triggers that makes me feel more anxious. Like a pattern. So I could deal better with it I dont have any pro help. I've realized that my anxiety gets worse when I have to talk with people. So I've been trying to better my communication. And Im better actually. I'm feeling more calm around other people. But there is something that it's haunting me since I'm trying to better my anxiety. I realized that there are some people that makes me worse. Sometimes even colleagues. For some reason when I see them or talk with I have a bad feeling a heavy energy and my anxiety explodes. Because of that I cant trust on them. And I'm always in the alert mode when I'm around them. I don't know if this is a problem that my anxiety creates in my mind or if it's something that other people also feels.That's why i'm here. I'm trying to understand if the problem is me and my anxiety or them. Anyone feels like this around some people?

52034,How to tell the difference between mental disorders and shit life syndrome? I've been trying to answer this question for a while. How do I know what's the cause and what's the effect when it comes to mental state? Am I depressed and suicidal because of how my life turned out to be or am I perceiving life to be more shitty than it is because of underlying mental disorders? I have never been to a psychiatrist so I have never been diagnosed but I've been dealing with OCD since I was 6 I experience a lot of MDD anxiety social phobia and ADHD symptoms. I've also been suicidal for more than 6 years at this point. The thing is most of those things appear so small when put next to 7 figures in the bank account. Most of my issues would immediately disappear. Only then I would be able to do things because I can not because I have to. I experience what I'd call a money induced paralysis. I talk a bit more explicitly about it in thishttpswww.reddit.comrGetMotivatedcommentsv4qq6kdiscussionlackofmotivationinducedbylackof thread. It's very unlikely that I'll ever be financially independent and it's unlikely I'll ever find something interesting enough I'd deem worth pursuing for hours on endAKA passion. Those realizations alone are enough to make me apathetic procrastinate on all matters and basically give up on life and wait for the right opportunity to kill myself. I'd rather be dead than live a life I don't consider to be worth the effort. I've been thinking about seeing a psychiatrist for the past few months but I have my doubts. I procrastinate on making an appointment because it feels like my problems stem from money it's not like they'll make me rich over there. In fact I'll lose money. That is enough justification for me not to go. I also can't get myself to schedule other appointments blood tests physio dentist because if my life will remain the same despite improving in some areas then why bother? I'll kill myself anyway without winning a lottery or without some magical epiphany occurring in my mind. I suspect there could be something wrong with my brain because plenty of other people have lives objectively worse than me yet they see survival as something of value in and of itself. That could be the result of them being ignorant me being ungrateful or my brain being disabled. So how do I know whether my shitty mental state is caused by my views on life philosophy bad attitude being lazy ungrateful spoiled etc. or by some condition beyond my reach? Or perhaps that's how it's supposed to be because my conclusions are logical and I just can't ignore them?,Anxiety

52038,I'm getting very anxious about my dental procedure tomorrow It's not something I wanna do but I'm made to do it. I had a root canal procedure because of an infection and my dentist recommends I get a crown for further stability. I personally think it's optional at the moment since it's my front tooth and it isn't subject to a lot of pressure. But you know Asian parents they're forcing me through it tomorrow. I'm so against getting a crown because it involves drilling away healthy tooth structure so that it will fit. It's permanent because tooth enamel can't grow back and so such a procedure I've been constantly anxious about it since the appointment got booked 3 weeks ago. Every day since I've been dreaded for the day which is tomorrow. Has anyone had similar experiences or currently has a crown in their mouth?

52052,Nobody takes me seriously Ive 24M dealt with depressionanxiety for years now. I used to be great with people make good money have the nice cars great girlfriend supportive parents friends that I could say looked up to me etc. and then I was diagnosed with depression. Within about a year I quit my job lost my girlfriend even though she was great to me and have yet to keep a stable job for more than a month at a time. My depression eventually was ruled to be treatment resistant after being on a number of meds and trying many other things. Some would work for a couple months and then Id fall even further back from where I was. But now after not having worked since early July of 2022 I am dealing with extensive and scary brain fog. Ive incorporated working out eating healthier taking supplements and just trying to live a healthier lifestyle as I figured this was coming from a bad diet my whole life. I also got all blood work done including thyroid basics vitamin levels testosterone etc and everything came back normal other than pretty high cholesterol. Both doctors Ive seen general practitioner psychiatrist has kinda blown me off when I tell them about the brain fog. Almost like they dont really know what to say or what the next step should be to ruling out causes. Im so scared as Im feeling like Im going crazy or have dementia. My parents are usually very supportive when Im going through stuff but my mom doesnt even want to hear me talk about it and my dad isnt always around as he lives about 45 mins away. I ended up packing some things and driving to his house tonight without saying anything to my mom. I just hate feeling alone and dont know what to do anymore.

What affects me the most is girls I think... It's ridiculous but I would love to have a relationship with a very pretty girl. Sometimes I think I've suffered so much that I would at least deserve that. I saw the damage my brother's death caused in my family now I think if I didn't have a family to make suffer gt suicide.

I need advice I went for a haircut yesterday because my anxiety has been awful. I had a CT scan this week my OCD returned in full force my house is a disaster etc. I just wanted to feel pretty. I went for just a trim and to color my roots so I would have my normal chin length bob that I curl. Its the best cut Ive ever had however my stylist and I dont blame him at all misunderstood me because I communicated poorly and chopped off all of my hair and stacked it so I have nothing but layers. To make it worse Im prematurely gray I thought it would be nice to blend in my natural gray streak with some color to highlight it but make it look a little more intentional. I now look like Im a mix between Cruela De Vil and a 60 year old that screams at Target employees. Im devastated. Im mourning my hair and embarrassed to leave my home. I dont even want to go for therapy today. I couldnt sleep. I know it grows back but to get to the point I want it will take over 6 months. I didnt want a pixie and my jaw looks cartoonish. Im not usually concerned how I look but I spent so much time trying to style it to fix it. I tried curling it to no avail. I tried to wet it down and with my natural hair I ended up a poodle.

Get really anxious blood pressure and BPM go up. Next in line is testing... I don't take tests now but I get really anxious. I stare around sweat a little. And then when the test is over nothing. It is hit or miss but if I have a presentation or in front of people get real nervous. Remember bombing for one performance where I just stood there... one time. Get nervous around attractive people for some reason. Yea. ... It is interesting... but these don't normal trigger. I am fine in crowds or social situations.

52068,Perhaps the battle with my extreme self consciousness will only end when I end The moment I step outside I become too aware of the way I walk the way my arms are moving when I walk where my eyes are looking at how I'm blinking my jaw position my neck position my posture. Basically the way I'm looking to another person I try to picture myself how I might be looking and whether it's not wierd. Sometimes I record myself with a phone to see what's the oddity with my behaviour.The reason this has developed is because from class 56 I realised there was something wrong... People would keep a stare once they got a glance of me. I realise in retrospect that's because I looked like a girl even though I'm a boy. Perhaps some hormones got messed up and I got some feminine features like long eye lashes girly lips girl type face curved hip short height. Btw I'm 27M unmarried. 7 months on antidepressants and anxiety meds. I would say definitely helping me find the light. One day I'll make it.,Anxiety

I lost 25 pounds in just the span of 2 weeks. I started therapy a month ago. Everything has been going well. My only problem is that Im on lorazepam as needed and sertraline daily. And Ive let my therapist know that I truly do not want to be on medications. And shes advised spiritually healing. Ive been practicing reiki. And just curious if anyone else has resorted to spiritual healing?,Anxiety

52073,Colon cramps after diarrhea? Hello!Ive been dealing with bowel mouvements when facing a stressful event which is annoying but I deal with it. I rush to the toilets and Im good.I read that during a fight or flight episode your body wants to removes its wastes. Be it. Problem is a few hours later I have to deal with severe cramps in my lower abdomen. I do not understand why I get that and its pretty annoying since usually the stressful events happen midday and I get the cramps from 8pm to 56am. I can barely move even breathing hurts. But I manage to fall asleep either way.Yesterday I had to deal with that again and it was much stronger than usual. I felt like someone was stabbing my lower left area every 34 minutes. Anyways I was wondering if anyone had had that before what exactly happens inside that causes that and if theres anyway to either prevent or help with ot when I have it?Hot water bottles and massages dont work. Thanks!,Anxiety
52074,Something familiar started popping up in regards to work and its got me worried So back in 2017 I worked at a restaurant as a dishwasher as my first job. But after the busy season ended I was laid off. Not only that but was basically laid off with no one even telling me since my boss at the time basically acted like I didnt exist when I tried contacting them about potentially coming back. For roughly 5 years since I basically jumped from one seasonal job to another. Then last year I found myself being rehired in the same position but this time the place is under new management. And honestly Ive loved it. Not only is a job I enjoy with a salary that is better than I would have initially expected but it also allowed me to make awesome new friends and get reacquainted with old ones. But since the start of the holiday season Ive been off duty so to speak until the dining room opens back up in May. Ive recently found out in the company group chat that it will open up on Mothers Day weekend to which I responded roughly with awesome. So I guess that will be roughly when Im coming back? That was 2 days ago and since then the group chat had been dead silent. Id assume it was cause everyone was busy and didnt see but the chat says that pretty much everyone saw it. And now its starting to feel similar to when I got laid off when I first worked there. And I dont know why I would be since pretty much everyone has said how awesome I am for how hard I work and how good I am at my job. So considering that I may not have anything to worry about. But the fact that everyone saw that specific message yet didnt say anything in response feels suspicious at the very least. What should I do? Do I have reason to worry or am I just worrying too much about nothing?,Anxiety

Super grateful cuz i hate people in my safe space but i also am offended that no one sat beside me? Like what kinda hypocrisy is this. Is it the same for everyone? Ugh idk.,Anxiety
52076,Looking for perspective I F18 have been given the diagnosis of GAD generalized anxiety disorder and it has taken an extraordinary toll on my physical health. I am in a constant state of fight or flight and Ive never been in this much pain in my life. Its the kind of pain people kill themselves from. I am constantly shaking and throwing up. This constant stress has given me the diagnosis of IBS irritable bowel syndrome. I had to go to multiple doctors as IBS is hard to diagnose. The stomach pain triggers the anxiety and the anxiety triggers the stomach pain so basically Im constantly in both mental and physical pain. However I believe it goes deeper than GAD. It doesnt stop. Its not attacks either it doesnt come or go.. it stays. Ive taken benzos and they dont do shit for me and neither does any depression or anxiety medications. I wish I could be sedated so I dont have to be awake and in pain. There have been a few incidents where I had to go to the hospital and beg to be sedated or at least booty juiced or something that would put me to sleep. Luckily I found lamictal and it has saved my life. I honestly dont think I would be alive today if it hadnt been for modern medicine. But this still raises the question of what is actually wrong with me. Im thinking of this because my lamictal is beginning to lose its effect and I have to increase my dose every couple of weeks. I couldnt get a therapy appointment scheduled until late June so Im kinda fucked.,Anxiety
52077,Driving lessons I really dont like driving and honestly i really dont need to drive either at the moment. I have had lessons in an manual this recently switched to automatic. I not a great driver either I get too close to the pavement and dont like going fast. When its focusing on parking Im less stressed out as its an empty car park. I guess I dont like having to concentrate and although there is less to concentrate on with an automatic I still dont like it. When Im a passenger unless its like a short trip Im asleep or if its short I am looking around or checking my phone.Went on much faster roads and lots of roundabouts accidental knocked a curb and someone on a roundabout in the left lane decided to give way to a truck waiting on the left while I was also on the roundabout in the right lane.Been having like 1.5 hour lessons and although I make sure that I dont have much to drink before hand and go to the bathroom twice before my lesson. There is always anxiety and Im either running from the car or very unfortunately last week was at the lights and far from being able to leave the car and Im still mortified. And canceled by next lesson and wanting them to just keep the money for the one other lesson I prepaid for. I just really dont want to see the instructor ever again. If it were up to me I wouldnt continue driving lessons because I dont like it and I dont need to. I am very happy walking or getting the bus. But my parents dont understand that I really dont want to drive.,Anxiety
52078,Can someone relate to this or have I broken myself? I need to premise this with saying that I recognise that I drink as it is the only time I don't feel anxious anymore and it's a vicious cycle. And so please telling me that stopping drinking is an obvious step I am taking now and it certainly doesn't help to say this to me now.Recently I have been feeling increasingly anxious and paranoid after drinking about things I may have done or said during the night. This is obviously even worse if there are moments of the night I don't remember or if I blackout.After a recent night out I dont remember going back home from the club with some colleagues who I am semi close with im new to the job. There is basically a 200meter walk home that I dont remember. I asked and I was told by them that I was very drunk and was vomiting but other than that it was a great night and we should do it again.However I am absolutely convinced that I said or did something bad that night. Just like I'm always convinced I did something bad the previous time. That I maybe told them I want to rapehurtabuse someone or that I was racist towards someone or that I said a secret. And even if they said that it was absolutely fine I'm convinced that they are hiding something from me that they are waiting for the perfect moment to expose me. That they are all laughingtalking behind my back. I feel like I ruminate over scenarios I may not remember or know even happen so much that memories almost build themselves in my head and from moment to moment a memory is more and more vivid.This is not a new thing in my life I wake up terrified of checking my phone for embarrassing or illegal things I may have done if there's a murder in the news I check the location to ensure there was no chance it could be me. The same happens in my sober life. I convince myself that someone is angry at me so I will spend literal hours looking over a phone chat between us. Thoughts or worries plant themselves in my head and I cannot let them go. One day I raped someone the next I have cancer. One day I pissed someone off the next day the past is coming to get me. I'm terrified of getting out of bed as something will trigger panic.If someone can relate to this then I virtually plead for a comment or chat. I feel like I am losing control of my thoughts and emotions and this goes for sober life as much as when I drink.,Anxiety
52079,weed anxiety i recently woke up from a really bad high and i am absolutely riddled with anxiety. ive got high quite a few times before and have never had a reaction this bad. im fortunate i was in a safe environment with people i trusted. now this morning i dont even want to get out of bed and i am full of so much regret for how i spent my night. ive actually made amazing progress with my anxiety and havent been at this level for so long. i dont want this hiccup to undermine my progress but i truly feel horrible. anyone experienced anything similar?,Anxiety
52080,talking weed use with therapist how do your therapists react when you tell them you consume cannabis? Ive gotten everything from the nonjudgmental does that help? to a full on rant about how drugs can cause more anxietydepression and please let us know if youre on other drugs I wonder if theyre giving the same rant for people who drink multiple times a werk. I think my main regret with bringing it up is I feel like therapists dont see me as reliable anymore. which is really funny because I consume a very small amount of edibles about twothree times a mo. and i dont drink alcohol or use any other substances. but I can see it on their face that they dont believe me. it seems like a catch 22. does it even help to be honest?,Anxiety
52081,Tiktok makes me have panic attacks I dont know if this goes here im sorry in advance. Every time i open tiktok theres this tarot lady giving her readings. At first i was like ok...

The thing is all this tarot readings are since day one i downloaded the app saying that my bf doesnt love me or that he's gonna break up with me. I know its not true but they still manage to put me in a anxious state. Literally a couple of mins ago a video of those appeared and well it gave me a panic attack.I dont know what to do anymore blocking that kind of content is no use and deleting the app isnt a solution too. I've tried it before but those videos start appearing on my instagram and facebook.Does anyone have advice? Please.,Anxiety

52086,Meds Help?! Hi beautiful people. I have pretty bad PTSD with life long anxiety and panic attacks. It is really bad lately and Im considering medication. Im a very happy person naturally and have never been bored a day in my life but the flip side of that is feeling EVERYTHING. Hoping you guys can help me. I was on Lexapro a few years ago for one year. I lost my zest for life but it absolutely saved me during a very hard time. I gained a bunch of weight which was not good because I struggle hard with my weight to begin with. Is anyone on something that did not cause them to gain weight but did work? Im just sick of being in constant fear. I quit caffeine and that helped but lately everything is causing me to panic. Please help if you have any experience with meds. Thank you so much!,Anxiety

52091,It sounds dumb and I'll add more context in the post but if a girl doesn't follow me on social media is that a sign she dislikes me? I know that sounds like a really dumb and childish question. I have a crush on a girl. My brother is friend's with her brother. My brother and her are also friends and seem to talk often. She had a crush on and liked my brother at some point maybe she still does I have no idea. Sadly we never really talk or anything especially outside of social gatherings where the whole group is already hanging out. I spoke directly to her and vice versa a handful of times yesterday while we were all hanging out. It was kind of me just speaking for the sake of speaking I didn't go out of my way to do it too much though because I was very anxious nervous and insecure around her.Anyway we've never interacted on social media and she hasn't followed me or anything even though she probably knows that I have some social media accounts for example on Twitter she has most likely seen me reply to my brother's tweets.Am I just being childish and overanalyzing social media?I'm afraid she thinks I dislike her and or dislikes me.She probably thinks I'm weird anyway. I don't think she would like me or find me attractive in any way. I think she can tell I'm ambitionless and socially awkward and maybe mentally a little odd.,Anxiety

Ive always dealt with anxiety but its been terrible this semester. I think about freshman and sophmore me and I dont remember ever being this anxious. I think all the years of stress of engineering school have finally gotten to me. Between internships and summer classes I havent gotten much of a break. Winter breaks do help but Ive noticed that the recharged feeling I have after has lasted less and less after each one. I know Im almost to senior year and itll get easier but Im just really overwhelmed. I shouldnt be feeling this stressed all the time. Having so much anxiety has made me feel down. Anyone have any encouraging words or tips? Thanks!,Anxiety
52101,Being treated like a drug addict I have been on antidepressants since the age 15. I have severe anxiety that sometimes leads to anxiety attacks. In the past few months. 1 I hit a deer equaling 4000 worth of damage with a 2000 deductible 2 I used all my sick days at work 3 my psychiatrist quit and I wasnt able to get my Zoloft or adhd meds filled 4 an electrical panel in my car stopped working 5 I paid almost 200 for a rental car while mine was in the shop and I couldnt even use it the first day because it wouldnt make it up my icy driveway causing me to be late for work. It was that day I decided to go to my usual walk in clinic to see if they could call me in Zoloft because I was having a hard time getting out of bed. See your body cant stay in fight or flight mode indefinitely which is what anxiety is so eventually it has to shut down depression. I get there and they tell me I have to have an appointment. That was apparently the straw that broke the camels back. I began crying and hyperventilating. It was one of my worst panic attacks ever. Part of me was concerned they were going to have me committed. They were able to call in a 30 day supply and made me a follow up appointment. Which was today.And they remembered my scene. So obviously my erratic behavior is because Im a drug addict. I never once had to take a drug test to get my adhd meds with my old psych. This time they asked me to pee in a cup. I have anxiety so of course my first thought was that they thought I was bonkers the other day but I had nothing to hide so I obliged. When I got home I got a call saying they couldnt call in my meds because I tested positive for opiates. Excuse me? Thats IMPOSSIBLE. They said I would need to bring in a prescription to explain the reason I failed. I said I hadnt taken anything and that I could now care less about my medicine but this needed fixed to clear my name. They said they could send it off to the lab and I said YES YOU BETTER DO THAT! Yes I am still being emotional and irrational at this point. Not because of what they are accusing me but because my seratonin and dopamine receptors DO NOT WORK like they shouldwhich is the reason I was going there for help. Instead they decide to bring a devastating accusation against a person with emotional dysregulation ADHD and anxiety generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder. It is negligence. What if this behavior caused a person to harm themselves? Do no harm. The way in which they handled this was very harmful. Almost as if they have no training on how to handle delicate individual which medical personnel should. I did some research and guess what.poppy seeds! I just made a batch of lemon poppy muffins the day before yesterday. Surely the lab will be able to differentiate between poppy seeds and an actual drug right??? Its a small town and I KNOW they will break patient confidentiality because Im a teacherI just know itIve had soMe of their kids in class. Of course they will tell other parents. Im done with my ADHD medsI refuse to jump through these hoops anymore. And to be treated like a criminal. Im erratic yes but not because of drugs. Im falling apart right now.,Anxiety

52107,Very sudden onset of physical anxiety symptoms? Hi allI never struggled with anxiety like this before when suddenly I had a panic attack for the first time last month I felt suddenly extremely uncomfortable and trappedunsafe in the minutes leading up to it but the whole time I was still thinking rationally. But the physical symptoms were definitely there and since then I've been having these mini bouts of extremely rapid hyperventilation just randomly through the day and tightnesspain in the cheststomach. These originally happened whenever I thought any remotely negative thought at all but now they're just popping up at random times. Currently I'm sat here with my stomach in knots and feeling like I'm about to cry for absolutely no reason at all. I wouldn't say I'm very worried about anything in particular just the normal things I've been a little stressed about my whole life like school but it's getting really annoying to have these small or on occasion fullblown anxiety attacks nearly every day. Again this is all completely new to me. I'm prone to overstressing or worrying at times but these symptoms don't seem to be completely related to that since they come on so randomly and I feel like they would have popped up sooner during more stressful times in my life? If anyone has any insight it would be much appreciated because it's getting really freaking annoying and interfering with my schoolwork and personal relationships. At this point would something like therapy even help me if it's so primarily physical? What do I do??? Thank you!,Anxiety
52108,psychiatrist wont do anything i went to the psychiatrist yesterday which id been looking forward to bc my anxiety has been so bad lately that the second i get out of school im already anxious to go back the next day or all weekend im anxious. and when im at school im feeling the most gut wrenching anxiety ive felt in my entire life. also i throw up when im anxious. so every day i throw up usually at school. teachers are sick of me missing and needing to sit somewhere to relax. i told my psychiatrist who acts confused every time she sees me and ive only seen her treat 5 year olds that i will die if i do not start feeling better. because it has led me to feeling pretty hopeless and it often is so bad that it does feel like im dying. she just increased the amount of my medicine im already on thats obviously not working for the 279037th time even though i told her i wanted to try something else or get something fast acting. she just said she wouldnt give me anything fast acting because im young. im so tired of living like this. what can i do? im in therapy 10 hours a week for this and other reasons but i need something to hold me up until i can get through the day completely on what im learning in therapy.,Anxiety

52111,I have health anxiety and one of my worst fears came true. My bf found out he has a rare genetic disorder that has a 50 chance to be hereditary. Where to go from there without going too crazy? I have HA and one of my worst fears came true. My bf found out he has a rare genetic disorder that has a 50 chance to be inherited. We're commited and planning kids in the future. I freak out over a fuckin cough and this is driving me crazy. For me the worst part is that my boyfriend is an absolute flegmatic and works on don't think about what you can't solve approach. I almost broke down when he brought the results home and he was just like... We'll see what to do when it happens it's not like there's something we can do about it and then I saw in the report that they offered him an assisted reproduction option when we'll want kids and asked him if he'll want to go down that route and he said Dunno and it was obvious that he's not too excited about it. But like how can you even THINK about risking 50 chance of it being inherited by our child??? It drives me absolutely bonkers. Why would you even be willing to RISK it when there is way safe option that is not that natural but would ensure that we'll have a thriving healthy baby? And especially when the other alternative is pretty miserable both physically and mentally?We've been together for years and at this point I know him. I know he only seems to not care because he has a hard time explaining and showing his emotions. I also know I am being terribly terribly unfair towards him for feeling frustrated at him. He just found out something so crucial! He needs time and space to deal with it and he needs my support. Instead I am the one demanding emotional support from him I am demanding it only here don't worry I don't plan to freak out on him while he's going through this. I don't understand why I am being so selfish when usually I put others first automatically.But most stress inducing thing about it is he mentioned some of my health issues to the genetic center and now they want to see me too because they have a small suspicion that there might be something from my side too. Of course I googled the signs of what he has and well I am not surprised they want to see me I check all the boxes even skeletal malformation.What's keeping me sane is the knowledge that the disorder is incredibly rare and that neither of my siblings show any obvious signs of it. That in itself should logically be enough to reassure me that I am FINE but my brain refuses to accept it. I feel like someone took me stuffed me into a washing machine and turned on a turbo wash. And I want to scream. AAAAAAAAAAWhew thanks you for letting me get it all out. I really need to find therapist again and my man is coming with me this time.Anyone has any experience with micro deletions in their family? Or has anyone gone through anything similar? How did you manage to calm yourself down while waiting for the doctors to set up the appointmentrun the tests? I heard it can take half a year to get an appointment and then half a year till they tell you your test results. How did you survive for this long with this uncertainty?,Anxiety
52113,Obsessive thoughts about the past Hello.For about a year I've been having these obsessive thoughts about the past all the ways I've messed up and things I did wrong. It's kinda ridiculous I worry about things that happened 10 od so years ago and I was just a kid back then only about 12. I think about newer things too but especially back then I was cringy and mean to others for no reason I didn't like the band that they did. I never bullied them but I would kinda laugh at them and point out that they're being pandered to. Now I would just turn away and ignore them I don't know what was up with me back then. To my defense I was almost always the youngest of the group surrounded by people who were 1416 from both sides. I feel like I'm a terrible human being and that I will be punished for them any day now I don't know how exactly by some external force that will come from outside of my home. I'm afraid that people who know me now and are my friends or people I'll meet in the future will judge me so hard and turn away from me. I've deleted every old social media account I could remember I still make sure that my old emails are active so that I could delete any more if I'll remember. I'm on pretty heavy medications antidepressants three doses of synthetic pregabalin and an antipsychotic to quell my anxiety further and I can function well but these thoughts still come to me randomly and make me anxious. I don't know what to do anymore My biggest wish is to just move on from that period of my life and close this chapter. On one hand if someone came to me with thoughts like these I would tell them that it was so long ago and they have likely very little to do with the person they were at 13 Besides everyone was a bit of a little shit at that age. But for some reason when it comes to me I just can't free myself When I get scared I feel like an ensnared wikd animal only the snare is just in my head. Did any of you struggle with something like this? What should I do?,Anxiety

52115,I have anxiety about spending money. So I just spent a bunch of money on video games the online store for the Nintendo 3DS and WiiU is closing soon and I wanted to get a bunch of games before theyre gone forever. I could afford this purchase and I still have plenty of money in my bank account but I cant shake this feeling of guilt in the pit of my stomach. Its like theres this voice in the back of my head calling me an idiot for spending so much money on video games when I could be saving it for emergencies. Its not just with big purchases either I still get this feeling whenever I buy a 10 lunch too. I think this whole thing started when I was around 5. I was at the store with my parents and I wanted to buy a toy but my mom said something about how we didnt have the money for toys. I being the stupid kid that I was interpreted this as we dont have a lot of money and that the family was one bad financial decision away from poverty. Of course this was not the case but that didnt stop me from feeling guilty about making my parents spend money on me.and that guilt has followed me even now when Im making my own money.So am I crazy for feeling this way? What are some steps I can take to get rid of this guilt?,Anxiety
52116,Food induced anxiety is a special kind of hell Ive been a health freak for as long as I can remember but in the last year or so its dictated my eating habits so severely. If I eat anything that Ive decided is unhealthy I get such bad anxiety I feel as if I am poisoning myself and figuring out what I can buy at grocery stores is so draining every store trip is like running through an obstacle course. Its getting really bad again and I spiraled today after falling into a rabbit hole on how most of our food has heavy metals in it most notably spices herbs chocolate and root vegetables. After a massive crying fit I threw out my cocoa powder and am currently wondering what to do with all of the grains vegetables spices and herbs I have because I dont see any of it as edible anymore. I dont know what I can eat now. Im so sick of food being like poison to me. I envy the people that can just eat and barely think about what it might be doing to their bodies.,Anxiety

52119,Does anyone subconsciously hold your breath in while youre doing things like even just laying in bed using your phone? I cant even do simple tasks in peace. Even if Im adjusting to sleep and using my phone in bed my heart feels like its about to explode if I dont take a deep breath in every few seconds because I hold my breath in subconsciously or thats what my body just does to me at least. And then my heart rate gets up and I feel so uneasy and breathless from literally just lying down using my phone. I hate this shit. I cant even yawn properly or take a deep breath in it always gets cut off and Im left feeling like Im about to suffocate.,Anxiety

52121,I'm having palpitations right now.. Before anyone reads I'm in the middle of an anxiety attack so everything in this post is everywhere and some words may be misspelled.I think I know why too because the last time it happened I ate food that caused me to have a previous anxiety attack.After I finish this I'm going to get some sleep so I will read any comments and make the necessary corrections to this post in the morning.So anyway. I went across the street from work today to get some food from this chicken spot called Kennedy Chicken I live in NYC they're on every corner.ALL of their food is super duper unhealthy. It's all deep fried foods. Chicken and mozzarella sticks is what I ate. They even gave me spoiled marinara sauce which I didn't eat because I noticed as soon as I opened the sauce container the air pressure made the sauce fly everywhere on my hands and there were bubbles in it. I smelled it and it had an obvious spoiled smell to it like fermented tomatoes. I'm never eating from there again. EVER! And honestly I don't know how they're even still open.It has been a while since I ate their food until today.I've been trying to eat healthier foods. Even if I have to order out on days I don't pack my lunch at home I choose a healthier option.OR!!.. or..It could be that I haven't been getting enough sleep since Monday. And everytime I feel the palpitations coming on I always go to sleep and the next morning I feel better.I've been to the ER multiple times for palpitations and they tell me it's due to stress and not enough sleep.I work a full time job and I used up all my pto so it's difficult for me to take a day or two off for myself.figuratively rips hair outI hate working full time and I think I'm about to make a big sacrifice and go part time. Or maybe I just need to ride it out... I have so many financial issues right now that I can't do this anymore.I want to move back home with my family.. but I don't have a car... I don't have money.... I need to buy at least a month's worth of food for 1 person me so I don't have to order out.I don't have any idea how I've come this far and haven't ended up homeless.At this point I'm rambling and I need a hug... but these are things I'm dealing with at the moment.That food honestly tasted horrible though. I'm betting on my palpitations being caused by both lack of sleep and the fast food though.I wish there was a way to get my rent lowered so that I can afford to pay all my bills properly... I might talk to my roommate about it and see what she says.Okay.. if I have anything else left to talk about I'll make another post.Thank you to anyone who decides to read this craziness!,Anxiety
52122,I hate my anxiety. Anything that will alterchange my life in some way gives me anxiety.Examples 7years ago my bfnow husband and I bought a dog. I cried and cried the first night we got him because i was soo scared of having totake care of anything else besides me. A few weeks later the anxiety disappeared. I absolutely love my dog.7years ago i left my first job after being there for 5 years. I cried and cried. Had so much anxiety leading up to the new interview. Had ssoo much anxiety after being told i was hired. I was terrified of failing not being able to pay my bills. So much so that i asked for my job back. But was ghosted because they were upset i had quit in the first place. 7 years later still at this newjob its consistent i make money. I feel secure. And glad i left the place prior. 3 years ago i got engaged but wasnt anxious about anything. Because we halted planning a wedding to buy a house. 2 years ago my fianc and i bought a house. It was fun leading up to the week before closing. The day before i was crying anxious scared. I felt like iwas making a mistake. What if we lose the house? What if something happens and we cant afford it because we have a mortgage now. I was fine after a couple days. Im sssoo happy in my home. 8 months ago i got married. For the 34 months leading up to the wedding i had horrible anxiety. Every single night id have lingering anxiety some nights better than others but always there. The week before the wedding i was a mess scared of being married scared of the change. But i am ssoo in love with my fianc he is my everything. I couldnt understand the anxiety because i was happy! The day of the wedding i was emotion filled i couldnt talk to anyone while getting ready i was a nervous wreck. Once we left the church i felt ssooo different! I was actually FEELING how i felt. Happy excited in love. Not anxious. The reception was amazing! Im soo happy!Nowim 29 husband is 30. We are talking about kids. I want them but im sssooo afraid of the anxiety i know ill have. Im scared of the pregnancy what if i have a difficult time what if im anxious like i was for the wedding for all 9months? Im soo scared of giving birth of the potential postpartum depression me not connecting. Or what if i dont connect with baby? Idk im already anxious thinking about having an approximate date to get off birth control. Im scared. I brought up adoption but i hate the fact that id rather chose adoption JUST because of the anxiety. I know ill deal with it when the time comes closer to adopt. But it wont be 9months. Why does my body do this to me. I hate my anxiety. Who else deals with this? How do you overcome?,Anxiety
52123,Anxiety swallowing pills I have terrible anxiety whenever I have to swallow a pill even if it's small because when I was younger I would always get the pill stuck in my throat.

I wanted to share just in case anyone else has this issue!,Anxiety
52124,Will SSRIs help me? Anxious about sleep Hello! I had a really bad insomnia last February which made me sleep every other day for a week. My sleep has been okay since my family doctor presrcibed me Hydroxyzine 10mg for sleep. Although I've been sleeping well I now have this feat surrounding sleep. Everyday all I think about is sleep which makes me anxious and unproductive all day. It made me lose interest on the things i used to enjoy. Even before the insomnia I was really anxious about many things especially my health. Do you guys think SSRIs will help me? Or i should go with therapy? Thank you!,Anxiety
52125,Don't know if I'm in the right place for this... Recently it was seeming like my life was finally getting on track. I had taken control of my addictions I was being more productive I was seeing myself changing into a better person. Good things were happening.Then out of nowhere everything just came crashing down like many times before.I don't know if people think like me or that far ahead for that matter but I don't think I am the only one who fears such an overwhelming anxiety about not achieving whatever it is you want in life. I have been feeling like I won't ever be able to achieve even the most basic things that all other humans are able to achieve. I can't explain the reason why I feel this way but it's basically being anxious that I'm failing at life as a whole and that I'm not taking advantage of the precious time that I have on earth.Like I'm just here and wish to stay here but when do I start living?,Anxiety

52127,Trembling when talking about things Im around and dont scare me after having bad experience with weed edibles This might be a long post so sorry about that but I just want to have all the details. Back in December my now ex girlfriend gave me 2 weed edible gummies that were around a year old I think Im not entirely sure if this is true or not but I think they were each about 50 mg when brand new. This was the first time Ive done any drugs or anything like that not even weed but I wanted them from her and accepted them with a smile on my face being excited to do them. I then get home and eat them both at once and Im feeling pretty awesome and happy but cant really focus on anything and Im laughing a lot and smiling at everything while on a FaceTime call with some friends. Then I start noticing my heart was beating incredibly fast and strong at least I think it was I thought the left side of my chest would explode and started freaking out about that. I ended up freaking out and having a almost full on panic attack and thought I was going to die and forced myself to throw up then laid in the shower for about 2 hours on the coldest setting not realizing I was shivering and shaking like crazy the entire time I then force myself to sleep and wake up thinking Im dead and feeling like shit for the next week or so and had weird pains in my chest. I then cut off almost all contact with the girlfriend thinking back I shouldnt have done this and I do feel bad I was just so shaken up because of that experience fast forward to now I am around lots of talk about drugs I always have but about 3 weeks ago when I was going to smoke my fiends cart for the first time just talking about it gave me these tremors and I was shaking until I calmed down about 10 minutes later but I was talking to him with a smile on my face wanting to hit his cart I wasnt scared at all I just got these shakes these jitters in my legs I dont even understand why their happening when Im actually in front of or about to do drugs that dont even scare me just on Wednesday I was going to buy some weed regular flower from my other friend and I got the same trembles just texting him and had to play it off with the people next to me saying Im cold. Basically what Im asking is what is wrong with me? And how can I overcome these tremorsshakes when around these things this may seem really stupid or not a big deal but Im not sure whats causing it please help me thank you.,Anxiety

52132,I've missed about 3 weeks of class and I'm too embarrassed to go backwhat do I do? Hi I've recently started medication to help manage my anxiety. While adjusting to the medication I noticed it helped my society anxiety a lot because I stopped caring. However the downside is that I started to become very apathetic about everything and lost a lot of motivation to even get out bedgo to class. I've recently started a new medication and so far feelings of apathylack of productivity have improved and I can now finish tasks still not perfect but I feel like with such a low starting dose it feels back to like how I've felt premedication. The problem is my social anxiety has gone back up. I'm ashamed and embarrassed to have missed so much class. I tried really hard this week and forced myself to go to classes I've been avoiding but there is one class that I'm especially having a hard time getting myself to attend. The problem is the class is very discussion based and we have predetermined groups we work with the entire semester. I'm worried my groupmates will judge me because I haven't been to class in so long I just want to avoid the awkward confrontation Where have you been? even though I know it's inevitable. How do I force myself to go to class?,Anxiety

I always get to the verge of letting it all out but then it feels like my stomach implodes with anxiety and I have thoughts about memories I've repressed which just increases my anxiety even more until I'm stuck in the fetal position. Sometimes I let it pass naturally sometimes I scream or punch my stomach.I just I don't know I feel like I wanna cry forever to let everything outNot sure if anyone will see this but I really appreciate any response,Anxiety

52143,Finally told someone I was tired of her bullshit after a couple years and I feel bad This girl was cool when I first met her. But then she started being really annoying and I didnt feel like being her friend anymore. I would tell her something she didnt agree with and then at 1 am shed send these blocks of texts saying she hated herself and that I was selfish and didnt really care for her etc. Sometimes I just stop texting my friends for personal reasons and go a few days without replying. This was never a problem for my longterm friends but apparently it was for her. I had to step on eggshells to talk to her and I didnt like it.if anyone wants more context let me know but in short I just didnt want this person in my life anymore. I always knew she needed help so thats why instead of telling her to fuck off like some people suggested I did I would just let her know when I didnt like something she saiddid but not be mean about it. She would apologize for overreacting Id forgive her. But then she would act the same way. Today I told her I was tired of her bs and that she could block me if she wants to just stop texting me. I blocked her.It felt awesome at the moment but now I feel like an asshole. I dont regret it but I never said anything similar to anyone. My heart was beating fast the whole time. Should I feel bad for telling the truth?This girl has a history of selfharm and overdosing so Im afraid Ill be responsible if she ends up doing something to herself. But I couldnt take this anymore.,Anxiety
52144,Having huge anxiety about my second emergency dentist appointment tomotrow I scheduled an emergency tooth extraction appointment last Saturday with my dentist who I haven't been able to go to in over a year due to lack of insuranceunemployment. My partner went with me as support and also because I can't drive. The dentist receptionist lectured me for not coming in for over a year for scheduling an emergency extraction on a Saturday afternoon and then said they wouldn't be able to extract it that day because they needed to see if the tooth could be saved despite me saying I can't afford any other option like a root canal. They also despite me putting my preferred name in their site portal when I first started seeing them keep misgendering and deadnaming me even though I told them last time that I prefer my preferred name and go by hehim I am a grown ass medically but not surgically transitioned trans man. My partner who also goes to this dentist but has had only good experiences with them was apparently disgusted with how the receptionists treated me this time and now refuses to go back to them for their visits. But I paid 100 ahead of time for this tooth extraction tomorrow because the receptionists basically forced me into it by showing me all the other pricing options without insurance so I have to go back to them before I can move to a new dentist office. My partner is working tomorrow and can't go with me so I'm basically dreading having to hear my deadname and being misgendered and lectured and all that bullshit all over again but on my own this time. Like it's stressing me out to the point of almost crying. I don't usually get this worked up over being misgendered because like I'm kinda fat and my facial hair is scraggly so I get a lot of misgendering from customers whenever I'm working retail jobs but something about them knowing my preferred name and having been told about it before but choosing to ignore it is just... Fucking with me especially with all the other ways they treated me. FUCK.,Anxiety

We're seeing violent outbursts almost nightly this week the whole reason we started this was because of these but they weren't nightly at the time. He'll be fine during the day and then everything goes south when bedtime hits. All the anxieties of the day start invading his thoughts and suddenly he's hitting pulling hair kicking saying he wants to kill us he wants to die. Full blown anger. I have to hide every single thing in the house that could be used as a weapon. Is this part of the process? My husband and I are trying to be calm and patient and use tools to help calm him down using your senses breathing with a stuffed animal on your belly name it to tame it but I just can't live like this. All day I dread bedtime and what it's going to bring. The thought of going through all this yet again tomorrow makes me sick.

Just the feelings that arise from not having a support system experiencing chronic pain trauma and not getting what I want in life academically socially etc. is just all coming to a head. Life just feels so unfair sometimes. Like Im having to work twice as hard as other people in my life and Im just drowning. But when I complain or ask for help people brush me off or call me over dramatic. Meanwhile everyone is always expecting me to play superhero for them in their own lives. Its just making feel so wound up and tense. And I dont really know how else to describe it but I cant even focus on work right now.,Anxiety

Ive been having a horrible day so far as my abusive ex has tried reaching out to me this morning and i have just been super anxious and feeling bad about myself so i decided to do some chores and head to the gym.

I was so scared and on the verge of tears the whole interaction and he ended up giving me a ticket. Instead of going to the gym i just drove home crying thinking of how much of a piece of shit i am and now im currently sitting in my driveway crying and overwhelmed. I just wanted to go and try to make today a good day by going to the gym and cleaning the house and now i feel even more overwhelmed and depressed and anxious and stressed and i just want to crawl into a hole and die right now.I feel like i can never do anything right and i feel so worthless and horrible.

52154,I find it hard to ask for help TW discussion of anxiety symptoms Some context Ive struggled with anxiety for a few years but can remember symptoms cropping up at moments throughout my life I think its GAD as Im mostly anxious about being anxious at this point. Does anyone else find it hard to ask for help? when Im stressed by general life things job pressures etc it does cause me to be anxious but I hate telling people how I feel because I dont want to burden them or upset them. I also dont even think of asking for help until Im in a bad place and really need it. Does anyone have any tips on how to overcome this?,Anxiety
52155,Week long attack I was diagnosed with GAD three years ago but have declined treatment in the form of long term medicine probably due to my medical anxiety go figure. I would describe my attacks as completely random and not stemming from outside situations typically. For instance i will be laying in bed watching a funny show and suddenly feel like an elephant is on my chest. Two weeks ago i found a man hiding under my car in my driveway. I chased him off and called the police. Turns out he crashed his car up the road and was hiding from the police. I was worked up that day and the next but have been able to feel comfort knowing this wasnt some weird targeted attack on me. But a desperate man in desperate times or however the saying goes lol.However my physical symptoms have not left. My chest constantly feels heavy and i cannot get a good breath. I almost have to force myself to yawn to feel like im getting that deep breath. Its affecting my life mostly limiting my physical movements and causing headaches assuming from constantly forcing a deep breath. I dont have a pcp i can call for advice. But I feel like enough is enough and i would like to be able to breathe normally again. My mom has copd so I have a pulse ox around and my oxygen has been consistent at 9899 so i can mostly confidently say this is anxiety. My issue is do i call a doctors office and wait weeks to be seen? Or go to an urgent care pay 150 for them to tell me this is just anxiety? Ultimately what are my options here? I just want to feel normal again,Anxiety

52163,Anxiety is ruining my life I am now into my 30s and feel like my life is passing me by while I am unable to enjoy it due to being anxious all of the time. I have a great job and feel like I am going to ruin it because I am so socially anxious and awkward. The only time I feel like I can truly enjoy the company of other people and not feel like my flight or flight is x100 is when I take a low dose opiate or drink alcohol. I stopped doing all of it for two years thinking that I might get better if I dont use any substances but it just spiraled into extreme anxiety and depression since I didnt get any breaks from it. I have tried every SSRISNRITCA under the sun and they dont work. I dont know what the point of this post is other than to vent I guess.,Anxiety
52164,Ive been having panic attacks that resulted in extreme adrenaline rushes daily for the past few weeks. I am a 24yo male i have suffered with gad and panic attacks ever since i was 16. Over the years i went to therapy and even overcame mostly at least my health anxiety. To a point that both my psychiatrist psychotherapist? Imho not sure English isnt my first language and I felt as if could go back to going to a psychologist. Everything has been going okay i kept eating well i exercise regularly 45 times x week at the gym walks with my dog and i try to walk around as much as i can other than my commute to work not 10k steps on most days but i try to stay active I have been on medications. I used xanax regularly and then started using it only if needed. Once these panic attacks began i decided to switch to diazepam since the xanax was making me very sleepy without helping too much with the anxiety. That didnt help. I started having panic attacksadrenaline rushes for every minor incident or event. 5 mins late for a meetupreservation? High heart rate anxiety all the usual. Calling a client on the phone and telling them theyll have to pay xx amount? Same result. Everything minor sends me towards a panic attackadrenaline rush. Even weed which i smoked probably once per week on a friday evening started giving me horrible panic attacks even if wasnt still high yet. Im really at a loss here i dont want to go on like this and Im kind of worried for my health and the impact this anxiety has on it. I will bring this up during my next session but in the meantime i wanted to confront myself with someone that hasis experiencing the same issues.Thank you all,Anxiety

52167,I didn't have the courage to go to an event bc of anxiety I was supposed to go to a pub crawl event this evening but got cold feet right before the event started and now I'm sad disappointed and alone at my home. The first three hours before the event I was feeling okay and so sure I would be going but slowly the panic started to kick in. And I ended up shaking and crying while changing my clothes and getting ready for the evening. And then I just gave up. It sucks I really wanted to go the event sounded like a blast and I already bought the ticket. It all came crashing down when I realised that I don't know anyone from the event and that I had to make the effort of meeting new people there alone. I thought I could be brave and go to that place alone because none of my friends didn't want to come with me. I have gone to events before alone and it has been fine in the end even if I was super anxious about going there beforehand. I guess today was just not my day... ,Anxiety
52168,my anxiety has gotten out of control Tldr Been following this sub from a diffrent profile. Finally decided to post. For years ive struggled with what were thought too be temporal lobe seizures. Severe deja vu waves of nausea and it loose the ability to understand verbal communication or speak coherently these last for 1015 minutes and occur 3 or 4 times a day. We have tried and tried to catch them on the eeg but are unable to. My neurologist refered me to a psychiatrist who calls them pseudo seizures and insists they are anxiety based and that whether I want to admit it or not i have PTSD from childhood trauma and some militarylaw enforcment experiences in my 20's. I am a father of 4 I am in the process of changing jobs which will require us to move. We are in the process of selling a house buying a house changing jobs relocating to another state. In addition my wifes emoloyeer refused her request to relocate and she was laid off last week. We homeschool 2 kids and my current job requires travel 45 weeks out of the year. My job is very high stressed. Im in a high executive management position with thousands of direct reports financial obligations budget goals profit goals plus increasingly difficult daily operational goals. Over the last few months my anxiety has become debilitating! Even with my medication trileptal and seriquil im to the point were I can be walking down the street and get the image in my head of a car swerving and hitting my on the side walk. This thought gets glued in my head and i am scared to walk down the street. Yesterday I was dozing on the couch and my 5 year old laid their tablet on my chest. The power cord stretched across my neck and i woke screaming with the image stuck in my head of being strangled by a power cord. Its as if I live in red alert. Loud noises sudden movements crowded rooms new unfamiliar settings traffic...i try my best to avoid it all but the isolation is becoming severe. This is happening more and more frequently. Im honestly scared. Ive tried discussing with my wife but she dosnt get it. She is so task oriented that any free time we have is used to discuss analyze dissect reanalyze plan replan budget etc for all of the major upcoming moves we have. This serves as a constant reminder of how overwhelmed I am. Im drinking to much to sleep and try to temporarily check out. But its killing me and im ready to give up. Im seriously considering checking myself into a hospital. But i will loose my job and it will throw a wrench into all the plans we have been making for the last year. Im hoping that people with similar minds can give suggestions before its to late.,Anxiety

Now the shit part of this is I need to wake up at 5am most days. Im not having anxious thoughts just the physical anxiety. Is this just a lizard brain thing because Im a bit stuck in fight or flight? Like waking up in the dark makes my body prepare to protect me? Idk. Ive ordered a sunrise alarm clock to try and trick my brain a bit.

I know that I know how to do most of my job. But Im petrified of things that havent happened yet or that I think will happen. I will subconsciously do anything to divert my mind from actually lifting my hand and starting my work. A cycle of living in fear of everything I worked for falling apart..just because Im having crippling anxiety the last few months.Its so frustrating to even look at myself be this way knowing how hard i can work. Instead Im here panicking internally about everything happening all the time whats due whats coming up not really being 100 clear on anything.Its been a very difficult two years for me and i feel like its all coming down at once ..after just drowning it all on micro distractions to keep my mind at bay. I told my boss a relative im going to come by on friday and discuss something. Something being im losing grip of myself and I need to step down.Ive already been dealing with the internal battle of if thats the right thing to do or the cowardly thing to do. Still dont know if im just feeling sorry for myself or actually deserve a break. Either way Im still going to be jobless after up to my neck in bills and responsibilities im still trying to manage. I put everything into what i do with every job. blood sweat and tears. I just get so invested and always come out the other side completely stripped bare emotionally physically mentally.I am not sure if this is going to be the case for every job.

I am alone in the waiting room with only one man and thats all. For the 15 minutes i am here i am shaking and trying not to cry. What doesnt help is the fact that like this morning at a bus stop drunk mane came to me saind hi cutie and jokingly pocked me to my lower atomach.

52186,Anxiety Impacting Visual Ability and Causing HyperFixation on Partners Physical Appearance Hi allI hope I could get some opinions from the kind followers of this subreddit!For as long as I 27 M could remember I had pretty intense anxiety. As a result I overthink and selfsabotage a lot. About 2.5 months ago I got into a relationship with a phenomenal woman 21F. Shes so driven smart witty and funny and at first I was sure that she was absolutely gorgeous. However these past few days Ive been wondering if I truly am attracted to her. I know this is weird but when i look at pictures of her I find myself analyzing her facial features without even realizing it. I am constantly quizzing myself on whether I like her or not. This isnt the first time it has happened. I remember the first time I went on vacation with my one and only ex I suddenly started to hyper fixate on each of her features and started to see her differently if that makes any sense. Instead of seeing a coherent face i saw a collection of facial features. Her nose seemingly looked larger and the proportions were all off. Again I know this sounds so weird. I pushed those thoughts aside and eventually got over it she broke up with me for a completely unrelated reason.Im wondering if anyone has been through this as well? Part of me thinks Im shallow for worrying about this. But part of me wonders if its the anxiety thats causing this.Thank you!,Anxiety

52192,Why is It hard to accept its just anxiety after numerous tests and reassurance. Its been almost two years living trying to manage health anxiety and almost nothing that I try is working. Ive been on anxiety medication for three months and thinking I was only gonna need It for 3 months I have actually increased the dose and want to be in It longer. I learn a lot in therapy but always fail to incorporate any technique in real life. No matter what I do to cope I just cant shake the anxiety away. I know anxiety is a part of life and regardless its going to come up but I cant stop catastrophizing the anxiety I feel. The anxiety makes It hard to focus in school and at work to the point where Im close to leaving both. How do I get It through my head that I am okay. That anxiety is okay. That any tiny thing my body feels doesnt mean Im dying. How can I trust my body. How can I trust myself. How can I trust in the universe. How can I stop.,Anxiety

My friend is aware of my anxiety and noticed that this week it has been particularly high. Anyways today I went a bit mute I cant find the energy to talk and its hard to communicate how Im feeling. So today in lab my friend was getting frustrated because she was hungry from not eating all day. And when lab was over I kind of rushed out because I felt a panic attack going on. I went to the bathroom to put cold water on my face. She got angry at me texting me saying where the fuck are you? And when she found me she sat there with a look on her face. I told her she can go to the dining hall but instead she went back to the lab classroom and started to talk shit about me to our lab partner. So now Im currently sitting here too afraid to even talk to anyone I just wish I could get rid of this. I hate feeling this way and making everyone around me upset.,Anxiety

The wait times for psych are extremely long over a year in my country and a lot of guesswork falls on family doctors. I also work in medicine.

If we are telling our doctors that the medication makes us feel worse or causes unwanted side effects why would increasing the dosage make it better?,Anxiety

52209,Does anyone else get sad or nervous when they get prescribed a new medication? Ive been struggling with anxiety since childhood and have had multiple psychiatrists therapists and general practitioners help me try to find the right combo of meds to help me. Recently Ive been in a 6 month long extended period of anxiety for many reasons but we have also been trying to find the right meds. Talked to my psych. today and we decided to add a new medication in to try one I used in high school that was helpful at the time however I still felt a little sad after the appointment. Im happy to be working toward a helpful solution but mourning the fact that I cant be normal and will likely be on medications for a very long time. It makes me feel a little broken and I fear my friends and family may even see me that way. Im just wondering if anyone else has felt this way?

It hasn't really caused any issues besides me feeling super out of it amp pain until recently after a really sharp pain in the left side of my head which has lead to the ''buzzing'' in my head getting a lot worse and the same side throbbing randomly. I'm so anxious it could be something serious but my brain is also telling me i'm overreacting. it's causing my health anxiety to flare up a lot It's gotten so bad i'm wide awake googling symptoms of what it could possibly be amp struggling to even relax at home because the symptoms are constant which leads my anxiety going through the roof and the cycle continues. I wanna go to the doctor but I also don't wanna waste their time in case they can't help me or it isn't anything at all amp it's all in my head. I was struggling before this but now this is really debilitating for me. I don't wanna get out of bed because i'm just gonna have to deal with the random painthrobbing and the anxiety about it. I just wanna feel normal again.,Anxiety
52211,Unable to overcome extreme stress severely impacting my productivity I am seriously regretting my decision to go to grad school I thought I was prepared for it but I'm wasn't. I was an academically strong student in my undergraduate program and went straight to grad school after because I really enjoy academia. I found my education to be so fulfilling but now the spark is completely lost.Ever since starting grad school my anxiety has NEVER been worse. I have always struggled but not like this. I have panic attacks just from opening up my computer to do work. The thought of opening my email makes my chest hurt. Anxiety is showing up in other areas I've had panic attacks because I was just convinced I was going to die within the next few days because I just felt it. I have panic attacks when someone calls me thinking they are going to tell me there's been some horrible tragedy. I'm convinced I see people with guns pointed toward me and I am going to be a victim of a mass shooting. I know there's something really wrong going on right nowAnd I'm so depressed. I have no drive to do things. The fear of consequences is building up my anxiety but the thought of doing the thing just seems like the most impossible feat.I've barely submit any assignments I keep trying to get them done. I tell myself that today is going to be the day I tackle even just one small thing but this horrible feeling inside my chest and stomach just paralyzes me from being able to get anything done. I tell myself in 5 minutes I'll get up it turns into 30 minutes to 5 hours then the next thing I know I've exhausted myself from just thinking about what I have to do amp I decide that I will try again tomorrow. Each time I try again I fail.I wish there was a way others could see how much effort I am putting in even brushing my teeth and taking a shower are demanding tasks. Eating isn't even enjoyable amp food doesn't taste appealing to me I nearly gag with every bite trying to feed myself.I wish I didn't have to feel like this. I want to enjoy school and pursue my passions. I was so proud of how far I've come only to let is all crash and burn now.,Anxiety
52212,Got prescribed inderal propranolol So I went to my GP general practitioner aka your family doctor and told her I had been feeling anxious lately especially before big exams or oral presentations I start shaking and feeling physically sick unfocused can't think straight etc. She gave me a prescription for inderal and told me to take it on days when I have exams or big events.However I googled and it just looks like something to lower your blood pressure. So not that I'm complaining because honestly anything helps but isn't this just going to treat the physical symptoms instead of the overlying issue aka the anxiety? It just sounds like I'll still have the mental anxiety just with a lower heartbeat lmaoHas anyone tried this medication and has it worked for you? I'm not doubting my doctor but I'd like to know how it felt for other people,Anxiety

52214,Diarrhea nausea gag reflex stressful situations Hey is there anyone who had these symptoms as a result of stress? I get diarrhea before leaving home if I have to get somewhere by public transport. Before dentist visit I get nausea and gag reflex without vomiting it lasts all the time and it's destroying my life completely. I can't go to the dentist I can't go somewhere by public transport I only feel fine when I know there is a restroom nearby and I will be able to use it whenever I want. My life is a hell. I react bad to all SSRI like my sister she has tried many ssri's for her anxiety disorder and none of them worked correctly I don't know it's genetic or what but me and she react very similar to them.

52215,Anxiety about being a share house So I'm a pretty anxious person but when I'm out and about I can sort of just deal with it. But when I'm at home and living with strangers I find it really hard to come out of my room to just do normal things like cook if they are in the kitchen or going to the bathroom while someone is around. It's really frustrating because I feel like I just sit and fester with it in my room but I just get too anxious to leave. My home is somewhere I need to be most comfortable so I'm finding it a bit debilitating not feeling comfortable. So does anyone have some tips for me to build up the courage to just become a normal roommate. I've tried making conversation with the person I'm living with but they didn't really seem interested so I think that has made more anxious. But yeah if anyone has any help that would be greatly appreciated ,Anxiety

52217,Health anxiety is steering me towards a nervous breakdown My health anxiety is getting the best of me lately. Been having eye floaters the last few years and tinnitus so I was obsessing over a brain tumor. Then lately it turned into colon cancer and pancreatic cancer due to stomach issues. Now I woke up this morning and smelled burnt rubber or something similar to it and now I'm back to freaking out over a brain tumor because I couldn't figure out if it was real or not. I did have my bedroom window open which faces the parking lot of my apartment complex and I didn't smell the smell when I went into the other room but still it freaked me out and now I'm obsessing over that. No I'm not sick and don't have nor have had covid. I've seen two old neighbors of mine die from it within months and that's the root of my anxiety with it and now with this what I think was a phantom smell I'm terrified. And now I can't tell if what I'm smelling is real or not. I came in from walking my dog and thought I smelled the burnt rubber again but it was just my coffee brewing.I literally feel like I'm at my wits end. I can't find a therapist due to time scheduling conflicts with my job. I was prescribed a medication by my PCP but I don't like how anti depressants affect my sex drive the one thing that helps me cope with all of this. The health anxiety is just getting worse the older I get too 35 now. It sends me into deep depressions and I feel like it's ruining my life at this point. It's like I have a choice to either be medicated and impotent or keep spiraling mentally. I hate this. I hate my brain and that it thinks this way. And I hate that you can get a fatal disease no matter how healthy you try to live your life. I'm so full of anger right now over all of this.I'm at work now and have such bad brain fog over all of this to the point where it feels dreamlike.,Anxiety

52222,Anxiety about my appearance separates my life in two sides Hello! Today I 18M fully realized that I cannot function properly as a human being unless I'm directly seeking acceptance in others. This translates to me not showering not brushing my teeth not shaving not even washing my hands when no one is going to see that I am clean and normal. I recently started college I've been making friends and generally having a great time this if u look at it from the outside. Inside my head I just cannot get the sense out of my mind that someone is going to think less of me and criticize me physically because of my clothes my face my hair because I have a gray shadow even after just 30 minutes of shaving because somehow I smell bad etc. I have crippling anxiety just thinking about someone criticizing my looks in their heads And don't let me start with my personality basically all this converts into me having a sort of Double life.When I need to go outside I do all the work I can possibly do to try and look nice smell good and be a nice person. But the moment I'm in my home my mind unconsciously switches to a gross side I don't take care of myself in any way type or form suddenly I am mean lazy antisocial and want to die once again. The cycle repeats day after day I've been trying to make myself go to the gym and eat better for months now but my body just doesn't respond every fiber of my mind tells me that I can't do anything right I will always be kinda ugly kinda fat and kinda gross so why bother trying?Maybe nothing of this makes any sense sorry english is not my first language and i'm just trying to cope somehow,Anxiety

52227,Backsliding Anxiety Avalanche 35 F and I need help. Apologies for typos on mobile and length but so so grateful for those who read this. My shoulders chest back and jaw are always cleanched like I'm subconsciously trying to curl up into myself. I cant sleep small sounds cause my heart to race and I wake up with adrenaline. I'm always exhausted and because of this I'm feeling so hopeless. I cry out of fear or frustration at least once a day now making me feel pathetic and empty. I shake have numb limbs depersonalization and chronically check my pulse. I feel like I'm dying all the time and like someone vacuumed all the joy and confidence I once built up out of my soul.I stopped taking sertraline after 8ish years and it's going terribly. I slowly weaned myself off because of an imminent lack of insurance back in September and I'm not doing well. Before I went off medication I went part time from working a full time management position for over 12 years. At first I was elated to be home so much. I had dreamed of being part time accomplishing so many things at home we bought a foreclosed home 9 years ago with TONS of issues just being less stressed in general but because of the part time status I lost insurance. My partner who works 12 hour days and I were not married yet and knowing I would lose coverage and wanting to get pregnant soon I slowly weaned myself off Sertraline as responsibly as possible. This actually went okay surprisingly but I'm thinking it was because I still had medication in my system. Before I was off meds I was binge drinking about 23 times per week which has been an issue since I was 18 as well as insane amounts of weed smoking so additional self medication that was frankly really bad to do on meds. Drinking was ingrained in me as a coping mechanism that caused so so many problems over the years. Being medicated helped numb the terrible anxiety and withdrawing I would go through with drinking so it made it possible to continue this cycle for years. I am a very naturally anxious person from childhood until now. I am an only child who had an extremely verbally abusive father which I know caused a lot of problems. By December of this year I had noticed the familiar feelings of not just hintsofanxiousness but the crippling anxiety coming back. I drink a bit in Decemeber and for at least five days after would notice terrible horrible anxiety withdrawals and sleeplessness. This was so much more severe unmedicated I literally had to stop which had not happened consistently since my teens. Because of it being a coping mechanism and major ingrained habit I had some huge issues mourning a friend and psuedotool I had used for years to overcome social anxiety and insecurity. This was obviously never helping but in the throes of addiction and habit I couldn't recognize it. Then caffeine started affecting me in a negative way. Even small amounts would cause heart palpitations and severe unease. It became a gateway for a panic attack. I would usually consume a decent amount of caffeine before work which made me feel more efficient confident and social. Just like drinking. Now I had lost two major things I used to cope with life. I had some peace with knowing I should have quit drinking years ago and letting it go but now I couldn't even handle caffeine? But wait! There's more! Enter weed smoking which I had already largely cut back. I went from smoking as soon as I got home from work to just before bed to sleep. I have always had major sleeping issues and maijuana helped turn my obsessive thoughts off so I could sleep. Now it was causing the same panic caffeine did. I had a violent panic attack in January after smoking and almost thought I needed to call an ambulance. I'm sure by now you can see I have some substance reliance issues. I know this and I'm not proud. I should in theory be proud I stopped three bad habitsaddictions AND antidepressants. Instead I feel lost. I feel empty. I feel devastatingly hopeless. I feel truly alien like I cant be a normal functioning human. I'm chronically jittery exhausted and scared. I feel like although overcoming addiction I have backslid into my lowest low. I have had to leave work because of panic attacks. I dont go out to social events unless absolutely necessary and spend the whole time in partial terror. I have no joy in anything I used to care about. I feel like I'm driving my mother and husband insane with my repetitive obsessive anxieties insecurities and attacks. They are so supportive but I cant help but feel like they are a little over it. The last two months have been awful. By now I expected some relief from my brain getting used to being off meds but instead I'm now worried this is just who I am unmedicated. I obsess about the house not being fixed people judging it things imminently breaking about not being pregnant yet biological clock shit disapointing family and friends and its leaving me feeling utterly hopeless. I have been in therepy off and on for years read countless books every supplement out there meditation watched tons of videos and documentaries on anxiety improved my diet reached out to others breathing exercises... you name it. I know most of the tools to help with anxiety. I've tried almost all of them. I have held off on going back on medication in hopes of becoming pregnant but that hasn't happened yet and frankly I dont want to start and stop medication again right now. I'm afraid of everything. I feel like I'm disconnected and disassociated from myself. Its unrelenting. I dont have good days lately. Shit I'd take mediocre ones! I have tried to push through get tasks done around the house to feel like I'm accomplishing something positive affirmations...nothing is working. I'm so tired. I'm so sick of being afraid of basic life tasks like making appointments working social obligations etc. I'm tired of feeling adrenaline over every sound waking up anxious taking hours to fall asleep because I'm anxious and dont sleep. Im so sore because I'm always clenched and tense. I'm always checking my pulse. Im always worried about horrible things happening to myself and family health related or otherwise. This cyclical unrelenting chronic crippling anxiety is making me insane. I am considering therepy again but past experiences have not been the best. I guess I'm just trying to find someone who gets it. This isn't something I feel like the average person who I've talked to about anxiety understands. Who else has panic attacks in the freezer aisle of the grocery store work or at baby showers? My senses feel so heightened to any stimuli. I cant keep putting on a brave face and hearing people's surprise when I tell them how anxious I am all the time. But you're so calm! You seem so chill! Ugh. I must mask it well because I'm internally combusting. This doesnt feel like it will ever relent and I'm starting to just feel anxious and depressed chronically. I cant live like this anymore and I'm losing all hope of improving. Thank you so much for reading!,Anxiety

52238,I don't know whether it's anxiety or an underlying health condition at my wits end 31F....I don't really know where to start I've been struggling for such a long time and I just don't know what's an anxiety symptom or symptom of an underlying medical condition anymore. I've had anxiety and OCD for the longest time had CBT a couple of times in my life but I still suffer immensely with anxiety it has taken the form of different themes over the years but at the moment I'm struggling awful with health anxiety. I have lots of physical symptoms and I do have some medical issues too and I'm finding it really hard to differentiate between the two.My main physical symptoms aretight chest and breathlessness to the point it feels like my airways are closing upstrange sensation in throat and tonguescratchy throatdiarrhea sometimes severe amp constipationabdominal pain amp nauseabrain fog and intense headacheslight headednessdry throatnasal drip feeling of tight muscles and tension in my abdomen neck and shoulderssome tingling and numbness in various areas of bodyAside from this I have been diagnosed with polyps on the gallbladder a liver cyst and mild fatty liver recently. I have also found some small hard lumps in centre of chest left of abdomen just along the bottom rib. I am getting these checked but not until 17th April! I have really been struggling to eat recently every time I do eat I get a lot of the physical symptoms I've described above then I get frightened I'm having an allergic reaction and am going to develop anaphylaxis I've never been allergic to food before but I do have asthma so I just avoid eating. I've lost over 2 stone in weight in the past 6 weeks. When I got the diagnosis of gallbladder polyps and liver cyst fatty liver it really set me back and panicked me. I've had two family members die of liver cirrhosis they were alcoholics though and I don't drink anymore and have never to that extent and I think I just got it into my head that I was going to die or these growths were going to develop in to cancer. I can't stop googling and searching my symptoms and I've come across something called MCAS and with the physical symptoms of allergy and various growths I have in mind I've convinced myself that I have MCAS.I really don't know what to do to be honest I've got a young family that I need to care for but instead I'm bed ridden and feeling like rubbish all the time and it's really getting me down.,Anxiety

52240,AI and the devaluation of humanity Ive been thinking a lot about AI recently. The explosion of ChatGPT Midjourney DALLE2.someone with zero writing or art skills can spend 3 seconds coming up with a prompt and generate something incredible. Something a human would spend hours or even days coming up with. And its accelerating faster than we could have imagined. AI voice spoofing AI generated images of celebrities and politicians plagiarized college essaysthese things were unimaginable 6 months ago. All this gives me anxiety and not just because Im a writer as my profession. Its devaluing human talent and creativity everyone can now do it therefore it means nothing. Oversaturation renders everything meaningless. And the irony is that humans made this tech that is now outshining all of usand will ultimately do everything better than we can.This is a pivotal time in humanity and I am not ready for it and I dont think anyone is really ready for it. Everything from the way we work to the way we consume media will be completely upended by AI. I just want to rewind 20 years and live peacefully. I dont want all this change.

I'm so scared that these side effects will never stop and that I have poisoned myself. My chest arms and back have been aching and fatigue. I am so sad that I started these because I'm scared this is going to end up killing me. Sites or other reddit users keep using the words poison or ruined my life etc. I'm jus scared it won't stop.

52243,Anxiety med. that's not an antidepressant? Hello! I have always been anxious and as of 23 years ago I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I've been in therapy for years and tried all sorts of medications Lexapro Zoloft medical marijuana CBD Valium Klonopin Xanax Amitriptyline and the only thing that worked were the benzos. I'm extremely lucky to have an NP who fills my Xanax refills. The problem is... I don't want to be addicted to this medication. I take it very sparingly which is why it works so well but I only take these when I feel nauseousjitterypanicky which fortunately is not 247. However I do have GAD pretty bad. In the shower thoughts just race and I can't find the off switch. It's ruined my sleep. It's taken a dump on my memory. I just cannot live like this anymore. Meditations help in the moment I do them but I feel like I need to be medicated. I was on Zoloft for about 6 months and it helped tremendously but when I tried getting back on it I properly titrated my dose when I get off them for some reason the side effects were extremely unbearable. Granted I started back at 50mg when before I was on it for 25mg for a week and then 50mg the second week and continued for 46 weeks. It could also be that at the time I could tolerate medical marijuana but now that makes me either anxiousjittery or straightup nauseous. Lexapro? Forget it. I started at 10mg and that was a nightmare. I was so nauseous by day 2 if it wasn't for my antinausea med I would've projectile vomitted all over my kitchen floor. The other time I was at 5mg and I felt so cracked out. I also don't like that SSRIs are rough on my body for 46 weeks. Maybe that's just the gamble you take but I hate having increased anxiety inability to ejaculate and horrendous stomach pains for a month. Does that sound like fun to anyone? I took amitriptyline and that was more for chronic pain and it barely did anything and as for anxiety I didn't notice much of a difference either and I tried this medication at 10 and 25mg.I have an appointment with my NP tomorrow and she is well aware I struggle with anxiety. Is there a medication that's not an antidepressant that works for GAD and is not a benzo meaning I can take as often as needed? I've also tried supplements like LTheanine Melatonin and Ashwagandha and they don't do crap. Any experiences with nonantidepressants that worked for you?,Anxiety

Anything like public presentation job interview doctor appt or even going to a friends house party or going out haha i rarelyDays before ill start preparing night before i can barely sleep. I can feel adrenaline increasing 2448 hours. I get EXTREMELY alert.The day of i wake up i cant eat anything. Cant even drink more than a few sips of water.The hours leading up i begin HARD coughing and dry heaving. To the point ill damage my throat and it gets sore. I never actually throw up but this has been happening so long i just dont eat to be safe. Still i get uncontrollable gagging. Like i actually think i gave myself a hernia. Im talking violent gagging until i see stars floaters and lights in my eyes heart racing chest muscles stomach strained and hurting from the none stop gagging and heaving and coughing.Then right when i walk into the event its all gone. Im still nervous but my mind tends to blank out and i disassociate a lot. This really fucks up technical job interviews because i totally blank out. A pure calm bliss blank state.AFTER i go home a complete weight is lifted off me. Im STARVING now. Extremely low anxiety relaxed rest state.

52247,Health Anxiety This past few months Ive had a set of symptoms that have had me worried that I have a neurological disorder. I am wondering if these symptoms could be caused by stress and if anyone here has had similar symptoms they know to be caused by stress.A little context I recently got accepted into my dream job. The only hitch is that it has intense training for six months where if you fail a test at any point you are dismissed. The material we are required to study is immense in volume and the tests are close to twice a week.In the month leading up to the course I found myself experiencing a small head fog. It developed more and more over the weeks into the worst head fog of my life. I could barely think and always felt a sort of pressure in my head. Math I would normally fly through was difficult and even just simple thoughts were hard to get out sometimes. As the course started my vision started to feel off not quite sure if it wasis double or blurry as its not that bad but I can tell its off. My eyes also got super sore for a week or so. About a week ago I also started to feel my left jaw and arm go a bit numbtingly. Its mostly there but comes and goes in intensity. Since the head fog I have been chronically online in search of answers which has lead me down every rabbit hole. I am frightened i have something like MS and though I know my research into it along with my stress with my course is more likely to blame I cant help but doubt that stress alone could give me blurry vision numb armface and immense brain fogI would really appreciate anyones experience with stress ms or related symptoms.Thanks all,Anxiety

52250,Its hard to be anxious and also want people to think youre happy Like when Im anxious there isnt much I can do about it I can try to self soothe and whatnot but its still hard to put on a smiley face and be upbeat and cheerful. Especially when you can feel this way for days at a time or longer. But people look at you differently if youre not upbeat and bubbly and cheerful especially as a woman. If I dont enjoy everything or laugh at everything or keep conversation Im grumpy or in a bad mood or just weird. And what am I supposed to say? That Im anxious? So they can respond why and thats just a rabbit hole I cant go into.,Anxiety

52261,I need advice. Ive had Crohns since I was 6 years old currently 21 and it has affected me more than I realized. My mental health is very bad and has been since 2020. My mother passed away the moment I graduated high school in 2019 and I havent been the same since. I dont have any other family near me to help me out and Im alone in my head all the time even though I have a girlfriend. She helps me as best as she can but it doesnt change anything once nighttime comes around. Once shes asleep Im back to overthinking and start crying and want to just end it all. I miss my old life I miss what I used to have and Ill never be the same again. And just thinking about that kills me. Ive been told many of times to just think about the present instead of the future or past or dont think badly try to think of all the good times and BS like that but it doesnt work for me. Im mentally fucked up and physically with my stomach. I physically cant work due to my Crohns Im on the toilet at least 56 times a day sometimes even up to 10 times. And its never pretty. I dont know what to do anymore Im on a small budget and Im just tired of feeling like this. I used to smoke weed but Ive stopped thinking it would help out in the long run but it hasnt been any different since Ive quit. I will not take pills I do not want to get addicted to anything or be stuck on psych meds. Please God can someone help me find a way to make it out. Im so smart and I have such a good head on my shoulders but I just physically and mentally cant work or do anything 70 of the day. Please if anybody has any advice on what I can do to get the voices out of my head without admitting myself I would be forever grateful.,Anxiety

52265,unsettling feelings Im feeling something hard to describe and a bit numb. I assume it has to do with anxiety because of my breathing patterns and overthinking. It's triggered very easily by the confrontational tone my mom takes sometimes it's lately about a sensitive topic. She assumes my feelings and it feels like she's arguing with me about things where there's no need to argue because im literally just telling her how im feeling bad about the things i did wrong in my relationship and such and she's arguing about why i keep feeling this way about it and keep blaming myself for a lot of it. She says things about my ex that i don't know how to feel about. Things like her life is negative and all over the place anyway and she dragged you into it and all that. I feel like when she argues with me about my feelings it's a form of gaslighting. I had been doing progress recovering from hating myself and seeing things more objectively concerning the relationship. I always feel like im pretending whenever im not doing well or when i intentionally try to get better. I never perceived i had real struggles in life. In therapy i saw that i did have things to deal with invisibly with my family. I had set for the last few days on the road for feeling more authentic with myself and people around me. I felt the breakup was an obvious hurdle that i can make use of for growth without feeling pretentious about overcoming things because of how it forced me to rethink things about myself while validating why they're there to begin with.Mom's argument for the relationship is just that my ex was a very negative person who's carelessly trying to gatekeep me. I spiralled so hard after a tough breakup conversation where i saw it wasnt true. I hated how i couldve been convinced of that too. I hate the person it made me. I hate how in my head i was throughoit the whole relationship and mom contributed to that. Im too impressionable with mom.Somehow these things are linked now that i write without inhibitions. I guess i'll just keep writing until this feeling of emptiness passes. But i was starting to like myself more as of yesterday. She doesnt know how much this approach of hers affects me! I was starting to feel like a more genuine and stoic person. Now im back to thinking in ways about my ex that im not proud of. I,Anxiety

I think I grew up my entire life fighting so hard for validation and only doing things for other people that now my personality traits feel like bits and pieces of other people and not my own. Ive also noticed that even though Im 26 I am hardcore reverting into being a child. I LOVE cartoons. I LOVE squishmallows. I want pink and blue all over my living space I want to be a little kid but theres also a constant fight against that with my adult side. Maybe im trying to heal my inner child probably.

I still have the meds and theyre not expired but surprise surprise Im too anxious about what could go wrong to take them without medical input. I feel horrible and my mom basically blew up at me the other day saying how we went through so much effort to make sure I had enough medication to last me during my time abroad and now Im suffering for basically no reason.

My GP did comprehensive blood tests a few months ago and everything was normal. I'm also on Acetazolamide for idiopathic intracranial hypertension. I can't stop worrying about my health and lately my anxiety has been centred around fatigue. I can sleep up to 10 hours a day sometimes and take naps at least twice a week. I'm really worried that I have cancer or a heart problem. I'm young 24 so I know it's unlikely but I cannot stop worrying.,Anxiety

52271,I need advice. Im really tired and scared TW suicidal thoughts Ive had anxiety and panic attacks since I was a little kid. Always thought I was having a heart attack. I was always told it would get better. After a decade of therapy and 6 years of medications its gotten so bad. I cant do anything anymore. I can hardly leave the house. I dont have any friends to call. My symptoms have evolved to much worse and much scarier things. Im coming down from a panic attack right now and my face arms chest and feet felt like they were burning up. That hasnt happened before. And Ive been having some other scary new symptoms the past week but of course I dont know if its anxiety or a legitimate problem. And I cant afford to see a doctor even if I wanted to do so. A few months ago I had one where my face started going numb. I sobbed in the car with my hand hovering over 911 on my phone waiting for the stroke. I live with my parents still but they are going out of town for 2 weeks and I will be completely alone. My panic attacks get horrendous at night. Recently they have given me some really dark thoughts. Sometimes I wish I was dead so at least I wouldnt have to deal with this ever again ironic because Im terrified of dying. I think what if? Knowing my parents are here at least gives me some sense of safety not much but some. But now Im going to be completely alone. Im so scared and so embarrassed cause Im a grown adult who is sobbing because shes scared of mom and dad going away. I genuinely do not have a single person to help me.,Anxiety

52273,Fear of Hitting People To preface I am not clinically diagnosed with anxiety. However I'd like to think that there's something going on in my brain that's resemblant of anxiety. I'm not sure where else to post this so my apologies if this is an inappropriate subreddit to do so.I've come to realize that I have a deep fear of hitting people. I don't believe this was induced by anything during my childhood I led quite a happy normal one. However I've recently realized that I would never hit someone even if it came down to selfdefense and it's quite deterring. I simply can't bring myself to cause direct physical damage to someone it feels like my muscles just disintegrate on me and my brain is doing everything possible to convince myself not to hit them. I don't know if I'm overthinking this or if this is something of genuine concern?,Anxiety
52274,Severe anxiety Ill be honest I dont exactly know the point of this post other than Im really really tired of living and feeling the way I am. From ages 815 my life was terrible. My family was broken apart and pitted against each other there was verbal and mental abuse every day seeking help wasnt an option and it was all made to seem like normal life. 6 years later Im still dealing with it. I know my anxiety and depression originated from my childhood and I know I have realistically nothing to worry about but no matter what I tell myself what I prove to myself how hard I work or how happy I try to be its never enough for me. I have a good job that I am interested in but it has turned into a nightmare. Even though Im good at it literally as soon as I get off on my way home I will start having anxiety about potential fuck ups I can make and the work I have to do tomorrow. Ill stress about work at least 50 more times before I clock back in the next day. I mean even when I sit in my car for lunch I start getting anxious. I see my friends maybe once a month due to a lack of motivation or interest in seeing anybody. It takes a long youtube video and about 30 minutes just to tell my brain to STFU and sleep. I dwell on my fuck ups and Im scared shitless of letting people down. I say yes to basically anything anyone asks me to do I actually think Im scared of what people will say or do if I say no. The anxious feeling of what if stops me from meeting new people going to fun places with my friends and enjoying life. Nothing gives me pleasure anymore and I rarely get excited about things. I feel very emotionally numb to everything EXCEPT stress fear worry and anger. My anxiety and depression was a main factor in my first and last failed relationship due to me being so numb to myself and my SO. I feel like I care about nothing. I dont find pleasure or happiness in being around my friends doing the things I love or anything fun. My biggest problem and the main reason Im making this post is that I dont talk to ANYONE about it. I absolutely hate having to talk about how I feel and what Im thinking even if its not about anxiety. All of my fear and worry starts and lives in my head and my head only. I actually get embarrassed having to talk about that shit. Im just tired of feeling numb Im tired of not having fun Im tired of this emptiness and Im tired of feeling and thinking so many things I dont understand. But this has been my entire life. Its not an on and off thing. Its how I think and how I feel constantly and at this point it feels like normal life. Im scared that no amount of work or therapy will fix it because I feel like I basically have to rewire my entire brain and lifestyle.,Anxiety

52277,My Workplace Makes Me Anxious So Im not too sure if this is the correct place to post this or get advice but Id just like to hear what people have to say about it. Ive been working at my engineering job for 4 years now. Its a decent job with VERY good pay and decent hours that work for me. But for the same amount of time it has been the main source of my anxiety. Its quite a tricky job with a lot of learning involved and its taken me a long time to get to grips with. Ive made a lot of mistakes in the process and with some parts of the job I still feel anxious about what Ill have to do or about making mistakes while doing those things. The main thing however is the environment and one particular person in it. Well call him Bob say hello Bob. He used to be my team leader but stepped back from that role to become team engineer still a somewhat ranked role in itself but more technical and is one of the most experienced and gifted guys at the place having been there for decades at this point. Let me preface by saying a good chunk of the time this guy is ok. However Bob is VERY hotheaded and temperamental and can be passive aggressive will openly berate people for innocent mistakes and will make jokes about coworkers and their abilitiesperformance that often seem to have a hint too much opinion behind them often to the point where youre not sure when hes joking and when he isnt. He takes his job very very seriously often to the point of some sort of corporate Stockholm syndrome devotion that may be an exaggeration but you get what I mean. As an example hes gone off on one at me before for not working much overtime and he has commitment and thats why he does loads implying I dont pull my weight by not working weekends etc.His whole demeanour makes me extremely uncomfortable and feel intimidated because I dont know when hes gonna be in one of his bad moods or take issue with something. Its been joked about before whether were gonna get Jekyll or Hyde today. About 2 months ago he openly berated near shouting in front of the whole team and my manager for misplacing a tool during an audit which I understand is a bit negligent but I did find it quickly afterwards it was embarrassing and made me feel small especially since that couldve been handled in a far more professional manner. The other day he made a comment about my rate of work rhetorically asking jokingly why I can only do 1 of something while he can do a lot more in the same amount of time. Funnily enough hes done that multiple times in the past and it never fails to make me feel heightened and worthless. I get that Im a slow worker and not the most skilled but he makes it out as if Im lazy and not bothered about my job I am very much the opposite. I just have less experience and work at a slower pace than most because I worry so much about getting things wrong.I just dont find Bob very approachable and that makes it even more difficult because hes our team engineer which means sometimes I have to ask him questions. But its been very often that hes responded to questions as if theyre stupid or something I shouldve known already.What doesnt help is that for the longest time the team has enabled his behaviour saying to me dont take it personally its just the way he is. Even recently when another team member was talking to me like crap and I spoke to my manager about it after finally having enough I mentioned Bob and while he spoke to the other person and she hasnt bothered me since he said he wasnt gonna talk to Bob at this time because it requires a far more delicate approach. From what I understand Bob has his own issues one of them being bad anxiety but it seems like hes dealing with it in very unhealthy ways.At this point Im just not sure what to do. I dont feel like I can ask my manager to do something about it because of his Bob might react or what he might do. Its not like the company would do anything anyway because hes so good at his job and does a hell of a lot. I could move teams where the work would be more challenging so I could be Maliki life harder for myself. But if I stay I have to stay in an environment that makes me constantly anxious and seriously affects my mental health to the point where just leaving my job has crossed my mind in moments of madness.Any advice or ways to maybe cope with this would be really welcomed. TLDR my job and a person there make me incredibly anxious and I dont know what to anymore.,Anxiety

I hope the interviewer doesnt look at my hair obviously.,Anxiety
52279,Driving Anxiety Hi everyone I wanted to just put a note here to see if this is a common symptom people experience even with medication.Ever since 2020 I developed severe anxiety that seemed to arise behind the wheel. It started with little things I would hit a bump and would spend a little longer looking in the rear view mirror than I ordinarily would. Eventually it escalated to the point where I would compulsively circle blocks or pull over just to make sure that these bumps and potholes were not pedestrians. And if I did circle a block usually there would be OTHER potholes or bumps which would lead to a mental downward spiral that drove me quite literally to insanity. It was one of these spirals that led to my first trip for psychiatric evaluation.After beginning medication this generally subsided to a manageable level and with CBT I was doing pretty good. Then in December of 2022 my wife and I were stopped at a red light when us and two other vehicles were completely totalled by an F350 who rear ended us travelling at roughly 80 KMh. He ran from the incident. Everyone was miraculously not seriously injured but Ive been set back to pre medication levels of anxiety while driving. This hypervigilance I drive quite a bit has now lead to significant physical illness for me. From stress Ive ground my molars to completely flat and the tension within my body from being so braced? I guess? And overly vigilant while driving is really locking me up. Ive gained a lot of weight too. Its lead to serious depression as Ive built a life that requires me to have a limber body.Does anyone have any similar stories to share? Or even just some relevant encouragement Im really getting to the end of my rope lately because of this.Thank you beautiful humans please drive safe and treat yourself gently.,Anxiety

52281,For anyone struggling with fairly severe anxiety episodes I highly recommend DBT distress tolerance skills. I recently started DBT after anxiety and depression became nearly unbearable for me and the specific distress tolerance skills and suggestions like hundreds of ideas about specific activities to do when feeling any kind of way has been the most life changing thing I've learned. I know DBT is expensive and inaccessible to a lot of people but here is a linkhttpsstatic1.squarespace.comstatic577d2ce937c58194f7d39816t60c7e92fa3583448b8c6fa191623714139969dbtskillstraininghandoutsandworksheetslinehanmarshasrg.pdf to the PDF my group uses. The distress tolerance section has a plethora of information and strategies to combat anxiety and low moods and I highly suggest just taking a look in case anything jumps out at you. My personal favorite is the TIP acronym cold temperatures like a cold shower or ice pack on your face intense exercise for a brief period of time like jumping jacks for one minute paced breathing or breath work sometimes even fast paced breaths for thirty counts then holding as long as you can all of which help trigger a system response that physically changes your state. Or very sour candy that distracts your brain for a second to snap out of it. Basically a bunch of tangible ideas to try out during a moment of panic. Just thought I'd share if anyone is looking for ideas. Love you all lt3,Anxiety
52282,Crippling medical anxiety So I havent been to see a doctor in about two years because I was insanely nervous about what they might find. I was hit by a car Sunday so I finally went to see a doctor today. While talking to the doctor I mentioned I get sharp pain right under my ribs often. She said it might be my gallbladder and ordered an ultrasound. Initially I didnt think anything of it but now Im up at midnight googling everything I can about gallbladder cancer and convincing myself I have it. Im 24 and all of my blood tests came back in the normal range both my age and the blood tests are good when it comes to gallbladder cancer. The only symptoms I have are the pain and slight persisting nausea. I dont know why I cant let this go. I would love advice from anyone else that has medical anxiety!,Anxiety
52283,My anxiety has skyrocketed due to my parents Im a trans guy and my parents found out recently. Ever since they will randomly bring it up to me usually crying to me about how they feel like theyve raised me wrong and how horrible they must be treating me for me to decide to be a boy obviously theyre transphobic. As you might expect these conversations are very anxietyinducing for me and have also negatively effected my mental health otherwise. However one of the worst parts is that I no longer feel safe in the house or even in the car if my parents are driving because they literally bring it up whenever they want as long as were alone. Im just always so much more anxious than I already was with diagnosed anxiety and I have no idea what to do.,Anxiety

I feel immensely guilty and have since apologised to her at the time it happened and a few years after.I am in therapy and my therapist tells me not to worry about it anymore but I cant help but feel I deserve punishment for what I did. Like to lose a partner not have a family etc. I feel like its just for me to lose out on something because she got something taken away too. I definitely faced consequences the teachers didnt like me as much afterwards and I got excluded from a party as well.I keep punishing myself and wonder if theres a karmic force out there that will punish me. Do I deserve punishment? Should I just let myself be happy? I feel like I dont deserve to be happy. Im not sure if this is my anxiety talking though.If theres anyone with some advice or been through similar feelings I would appreciate any input ,Anxiety

52291,intrusive thoughts about past mistakes I'm 23 and my anxiety started with health anxiety and once I learnt how to deal with that it seems to have transformed into intrusive thoughts about past mistakes and how they could affect me now.As a child or teenager ages 1018 I was just a really attention seeking person. I said lots of provocative jokes because I wanted to be different from everyone and sometimes I lied about myself or my family or other things. I still have close contact with some of the people who I was friends with when I was a person like that. They don't ever bring up anything I said in the past and I don't feel judged by them because of those things. But it doesn't change the fact that I really hate myself for acting like that. My brain keeps reminding me of all of those things that I spent years not remembering. I know that regretting it means I have grown and am not that person anymore but I still feel so guilty and feel like I don't deserve to forgive myself or move on. I feel like I should punish myself by remembering those things and never be able to live like they didn't happen. I really hate to think that I'm going to have to live my life having those memories and knowing it was me and noone else who used to act like that. I want to just focus on the present but I feel like I don't deserve it. I can't even force myself to study because it feels like I don't deserve to be successful in the future.Does anyone have any advice regarding this? I spent the last 3 days beating myself up over something I said when I was 15... I just want to live without thinking about the past like I did before those intrusive thoughts were so intense,Anxiety
52292,Does anyone else unconsciously tense upclench your jaw mouth when stressed? Or have other symptoms along with your anxiety? For instance I'll always catch myself doing it if I'm stressed over like talking to or being around people or waiting for a doctor's appointment or things like that. Does anyone else get that with their anxietystress? I've also noticed that when I'm stressed I'm noticeably more anxious and my body shaking and thoughts and feelings overall get worse. Anyone else experience these things? Haha this sounds stupid but I'm posting it anyways because I'm just curious hahaha Edit I also get some brain fog not remembering things somwtimes doesn't happen all the time maybe a few times a a week if im particularly stressed and or anxious about something important as well but I'm not sure if it's apart of my anxiety or if it could be something entirely different.,Anxiety
52294,I've had three completely separate illnesses in quick succession. Could this be stress? First I had a particularly bad flairup of IBS maybe a couple of weeks ago I haven't had pain from it quite that bad in a good while. Then I had a cold which I thought was on its way out. The small of my back gets a pinched nerve every so often and that flaired up pretty badly. And now I might be developing a chest infection from the cold that doesn't seem to want to shift. What's going on? Could it be stress that's causing all of this?,Anxiety
52295,I need help to stop my health anxiety I struggle from extreme health anxiety and it has exponentially gotten worse. A few days ago I discovered two big red dots on my neck and fully convinced myself that I was bitten by a rabid bat either during the daylight or while I was asleep. I had a full mental breakdown searched my room for bats and had an anxiety attack. I went to see a NP and a PA and both told me that it is not a bat bite. I have not seen any bats near me and while the doctors told me to calm down I simply cannot. Today my throat started hurting but I genuinely cannot tell if I am only imagining that. It is impacting my life so much and I don't know how to stop being so anxious. It has been so hard on me and my friends who I am driving crazy. Please be kind and maybe you can help talk me out of my frantic rabid state haha.,Anxiety

52297,Dentist Anxiety Hi I managed to get through my appointment today but they told me I have to come back for 4 fillings and a root canal and now I'm petrified. Does anyone have any idea what I can do to relax before and during my appointment and also if anyone can explain what happens during these procedures I'd be really grateful.Also I'm 17 so anyone have any guidance on how to tell my parents I have bad teeth?? As they expect to be perfect but due to other mental health issues I haven't been taking care of them hence my cavities Also how do you know to trust a dentist? Is it normal for them to look in your mouth for like a minute and tell you what needs to happen? They didn't take xrays btw. TIA,Anxiety
52298,Angerirritability I have chronic anxiety. I don't want to take my pills everyday as my family has addiction issues at every twist and turn. But I'm a mom I have an almost 5 year old and my husband is military so he's gone sometimes. When he's gone my son likes to act up doesn't want to listen at all. I'm working on it with him I'm trying to be productive. My anxiety poses a pretty big difficulty as it turns into pretty bad irritability and aggression when I'm dealing with frustrating situations. The only way I've found to help which it actually doesnt is to take on a bland monotonous tone. I'm struggling to find other ways to communicate with him so that we're both calm and hopefully things can get resolved peacefully. I just feel so bad when it ends up being too much and I snap at him.,Anxiety
52299,Anyones anxietydepression get worse when you are sick??? I got this weird virus its not the flu or covid but right before I got sick I got so panicky for a few days and then once I got sick my panic got 10x worse. Ive been sick for a week now and since Ive been so sick Ive been sad because I wanna get better so Im having some negativesad thoughts it sucks because this didnt happen till I got sick I also read that having a virus lowers dopamine and seratonin so that could be what Im experiencing,Anxiety

52301,Walking in a crowded room Anyone feel super awkward simply walking into a crowded room? Or even just lightly populated?Awkward like where do I look? Am I walking normal? Are people looking at me not in a narcissistic way but a low self confidence way? Ive had this issue my entire life. This could be as simple as being at a somewhat crowded gym completing a set in a designated area and walking across the room to grab paper and sanitizer spray to wipe down my station. Or walking past a parked car with people in it.Is this a different level if anxiety or are there others out there who experience this?,Anxiety
52302,Anyone get constant goosebumps from anxiety? Hey so this is a pretty weird situation I'm in but I've only just realized that my recently turned severe anxiety could possibly have a connection to me getting goosebumps all the time. First I get a bad full body chill from high stress and boom my skin is goosebumpified for the entire day. It's just a weird symptom that I wonder anyone else had.,Anxiety
52303,I believe Someone really has put a curse on me this year. I wish these past few months were all a joke. Life really said Oh lets make all these bad things happen to her and see her suffer yay! Bonus points because Life made my hereditary anxiety pop out at full force to. It first started when my dog started to act not normal. Her head would keep tilting every which way like she was drunk and eventually kept looking at the ceiling. It got so bad to the point where she couldnt walk or wouldnt eat anymore. It got worse during the weekend and we dont have an emergency vet near us so we had to call an on call vet from our clinic to come and look at her. He didnt really say much about her just figured that it was neurological. My mom planned to bring her back to her regular vet on Monday so they could further help her. She kept having seizures throughout the day as well and had labored breathing. My mom laid with her on the couch at night and watched the clock waiting for 7 am to arrive. My dog didnt make it through the night. She died at 3 in the morning. I woke up that morning to my mom and dad telling me that she passed away. I got up out of my bed and quickly walked to the living room because I wanted to be with her. She died laying in her little bed that she loved. My family came and sat around her crying and telling her that we love her. I didnt want it to be real. I wanted to say Mom dad shes just sleeping shell wake up and start barking any minute. But reality came back and thats when I knew this is really happening. I went to school the next day. I didnt want to. I just wanted to stay in my bed all day and sleep. I was so tired. I couldnt even pay attention to what the professor was saying because I felt numb and detached from reality. After I got out of class I started feeling like I couldnt breathe. It hit me like a ton of bricks. My chest hurt bad too. I started to take my anxiety pills again after that. I never had anxiety this bad before. I realized its not like a cold that you can shake off. It sticks with you everywhere you go for a long time. I started off getting shortness of breath and chest pain. Then it turned into feeling like my skin and heart were on fire and panic attacks that would jolt me awake at night and keep me up until 6 am. It did get better with time once I learned how to manage it. A few weeks later I was sending out reminders to my bridesmaids that dress shopping was coming up. I had reminded them months before because I wanted to make sure everyone could be there. I hadnt heard from one of my bridesmaids in about a month so I reached out to her to see if she was doing ok. She hadnt given me a response. The next day I asked if she was still coming no response. On Saturday we arrived to the boutique to pick out bridesmaid dresses. She didnt text or call and didnt show either. She finally texted me the day after telling me she was backing out of being a bridesmaid. I was fine with that but wish she had communicated with me better. A few days after that I found a couple of black scuff marks on my car. Theres a little crack by the marks to. Turns out somebody side swiped my car and I didnt even see it until now. I figured I probably got hit in the college parking lot while I was in class so I called college security and had to meet up with an officer to give them specific time frames to look at in their security camera footage. Im so sick of people hitting my car. I think my car has gotten hit about 5 times now. I got so anxious about telling my dad.I hope Life gives me a break after this. I desperately need one.,Anxiety
52304,The sad truth is . If i dont text people first ill never hear from them again It happens every single time. People tell me that they care about me and theyre my friend and yet my phone is so dry and this is not an exageration. I can feel myself dying from the loneliness,Anxiety
52305,Fear of changing job and bettering myself So I've worked crappy dead end jobs for the past 10 years and I'm just sick of this life. I'm sick of getting bitched at by customers while making very low money. I don't want to do this anymore. I want to finally find a job that pays well and that doesn't make me want to die by the end of the week. I've been apply to pretty much anything at this point and I was finally able to get an interview for a supply chain job. Its entry lvl and the pay is low but its way higher than what I make atm so I want it. The only problem is that since I've never had a real or difficult job I'm scared that I won't be able to land it and if I do somehow land it I'm worried that I'll end up messing up and getting fired. How do I get rid of this fear? My interview is on Friday and I'm panicking hard right now.,Anxiety

52307,Can my anxiety present as a constant feeling of butterflies or adrenaline in my stomach? I am really struggling right now and to make matters worse I am out of town for work. For about the last 5 or 6 hours I have had this sensation of butterflies in my stomach and an uneasy feeling that I cannot kick. Ive had anxiety issues for 20 years and my recent physical and blood tests say I am healthy but I am worried this is something worse than anxiety. I cannot figure out anything to do to get rid of this feeling and it is awful. Tempted to go to the ER but that usually results in several hours of more motoring and being told anxiety. Unfortunately I do not have any medication like Xanax so I am feeling really lost and scared. Does anyone else have anxiety present like this and for such a long period of time?,Anxiety
52308,Who else has a nervous stomach and closed throat right now? Meeeeee,Anxiety
52309,Almost first public panic attack Was standing in a room full of people for a work presentation. I was at the front and wasn't the focus but could be seen by many. I was bored so my mind was just humming along. Then intrusive thoughts came then a worse one. Then i was thinking i need to leave then I knew i can't i can't leave i can't have space i am stuck i need to run then the room started kinda spinning and i got light headed. I grabbed a chair and sat down nobody really cared but if i had not found a chair i don't think i could have lasted without making a scene or passing out.I guess this is about intrusive thoughts spiraling out of control.I didn't get a good nights sleep last night maybe that could have happened.,Anxiety
52310,Im so confused about my anxiety Im 18 and i used to always have rlly bad episodes where I felt like I was physically sick I couldnt sleep breath or my heart didnt work properly. I started medication about a year ago and for the most part like everything basicallt stopped since I never was like a thinking anxiety much type of person. But now idk I feel like I lost so much of myself due to not having anxiety in a way idk how to describe it. Besides from my emotions not being so severe which is good but also not what Im used to. As well as my grades are doing so bad and I have a constant thought of the world not being real. I literally have no modivation about school and Im doing so bad to my standards of what Im used to. Im not sad but Im not happy either and things do not excite me as much I guess. I also feel like I never had anxiety despite being diagnosed by 3 different people. I feel like I have so much to say and I think so much about life and different things but I dont at the same time. Its really confusing for me and I just wanted go share somewhere,Anxiety
52311,Is my 30s F anxiety screwing with me or am I correctly interpreting that this woman 30s F is not interested in being friends with me? I'm 30s F feeling hurt by this interaction with a friend of a friend also 30s F who I thought might want to be friends with me but evidently doesn't and need help processing itsome feedback on it. On top of my social anxiety I have other anxiety disorders depression and am possibly on the spectrum so socializing is extra extra hard for me and I really am lacking in friends.Here's the situationJuly 2019 Was at a friend's wedding out of state and met one of her other friends who lives in my state about 3040 min away from me. We hit it off and she said she's always looking for new friends and it would be cool to grab dinner sometime.Dec 2019 I never hear from her and reach out to find out about dinner and we schedule something but end up canceling because she has a family emergency.Feb 2020 I check in about how she's doing if she still wants to do dinner and we schedule a dinner. Our mutual friend happens to be in town so it ends up the three of us at dinner together.July 2020 Pandemic is happening. She includes me on an email invite to her bday party at her house. I don't feel comfortable going so decline.June 2021 I am feeling lonely and reach out to find out how she's doing and if she'd like to go to this outdoor concert with me. She ends up not being able to make it that day but says we should one day meet up for dinner and I agree. I remind her we had talked about some greek place that time we went out and she says yeah let's do dinner soon.September 2021 Never heard from her about dinner and reach out again. She says her next two months of weekends are booked with fall activities with friends. She mentions a few she's doing that I could join. I tell her I'd be interested in this farm visit she's doing. She tells me it'll probably be some weekend in Oct but she'll let me know the details once it gets closer and she and her friends decide the exact day. I never hear anything.March 2023 Now Get a random text from her asking how I'm doing. I get excited thinking she's interested in reconnecting. I'm feeling extra depressed and lonely and friendless as more friends have moved awaylost touch. She asks if I still live where I used to and if I still work remote. Yes and yes. I ask how she's doing but she's vague only telling me she saw another friend of our mutual friend recently and that she still lives in the same town. Then she says the reason she is reaching out to me is because she has a friend who is single and she thought of me. She sends me all his details and asks if I was interested.Man did I get so depressed! I thought she had been interested in reconnecting because she was interested in a friendship with me and regrets we never ended up hanging out again. I kept expecting her to suggest we meet up or something but it turns out she is only interested in me for a potential date for her friend. I feel hurt that here's someone I wanted to be friends with who I for the hundredth time thought might want to be friends with me and I again feel rejected.I know I could ONCE AGAIN ask if this woman wants to grab dinner for the 1000th time but I feel ridiculous at this point and like a loser. She clearly is not interested in hanging out with me or I wouldn't have had to be the one to reach out to her every time AND she would have followed up on those details about the farm visit back in 2021 that she did go on.What do you all make of all of this?tldr Heard from someone who I had been previously trying to befriend for the first time in nearly 2 years. Thought she was interested in the friendship but really reached for another reason. Made multiple attempts in the past to hang out with no result and feel like a loser trying again. Can't tell if she really is disinterested in friendship or if my anxiety etc is skewing things.,Anxiety
52313,I'm hesitant to get a diagnosis So I've reached the point when I amassed enough courage to ask for an appointment with a psychiatrist. I've done therapy for about 5 years and never was brave enough to ask my therapist if I had either anxiety or depression. But 5 months ago I started with chronic tensional headaches finished college and found two jobs ended up very stressed which I controlled after a neurologist prescribed me pregabalin. However I've been struggling with other somatic symptoms that lead me to say okay you waited too much it's time to do it. Even though I hate the idea of being that selfdiagnose person I've been doing a lot of reflection and truly believe I have several symptoms of anxiety perhaps social or general anxiety.I will be seeing this doc who was very recommended to me and I fear judgment but much much more fear is if I get prescribed meds that mess me up worse. I know she's an outstanding professional she has appropiately medicated my bf's niece for anxiety and honestly doubt I'd need something strong but I'm so scared of start taking meds I fear there's no turning back from it. I fear it changes me so badly that I have bad moments at my job in front of everyone like crying or a panic attack or that I make an embarrassment. I don't want to lose my job since it there are two but the full time one has helped me to get out of my lifeless and procrastination days. Haven't seen my therapist lately since she had a temporary license and now I'm also unsure if I should come back because she never made me a diagnosis. My general doctor told me to come back to therapy asap. Sorry for the long post I'd like to know if someone relates to this or your experiences but mostly if you know about meds and if I'm just panicking too much or maybe I just need to know this before meeting the psychiatrist.,Anxiety
52314,anxiety around smelling bad it's been 3 days but i have been super paranoid about this.my friend and i were hanging out and i don't remember how it was necessarily brought up but she said i know a girl who is very pretty but she doesn't shower and then asked do you think she knows after i told her idk it depends cause for some people they do and others they don't then she asked btw how often do you shower?i've beeb freaking out ever since then that she was throwing a hint that i don't stink but i have asked two people i trust that same day if i stink and they said no but what she said was too odd and random for it to not be a hint although she did ask me for a hug before leaving after the whole thing happened so maybe it wasn't about me?i have always had anxiety surrounding this issue because growing up i couldn't afford to shower everyday like i do now so i feel like she accidentally ? triggered me i genuinely can't tell if she was throwing a hint or what,Anxiety
52315,Anxiety and heart problems Hi everyone I was posting to see if anyone else suffered from anxiety and has heart issues going on as well. I have severe anxiety and Im definitely a hypochondriac so I started taking Zoloft 3 months ago to help. However for 2 years I have dealt with heart problems. My heart rate gets super high to the 170s at rest I get dizzy chest pain and I have a lowish blood pressure on top of that. I also noticed a couple months ago this feeling I get where I feel like my heart skips a beat and my breath gets taken away which I discovered was me having PVCs. I have done numerous EKGs which have been abnormal but my one cardiologist told me Im a 26 year old otherwise healthy person so its fine. I did an echo and stress test 2 days ago so Im awaiting those results. One of my previous cardiologists told me he believes this all stems from stress and anxiety and once I manage that it will go away which I agree with to an extent. I had another cardiologist tell me that even if Im stressed out having a heart rate sustain in the 170s is abnormal. I am also a nurse so I cant tell if me having an understanding of medical stuff makes it more difficult for me to handle because Im constantly thinking worst case scenario. I have this overwhelming fear that Im going to be one of those people in their 20s that has a heart attack or other complication. Ive seen people post on here previously saying their heart rate goes super high when theyre anxious but I wasnt sure if anyone had similar experiences as me or knows anything about this. Im sure I am overthinking this but I also dont like the fact that I constantly have chest pain and a high heart rate.,Anxiety
52316,this feeling of doomdread comes over me at random times does anybody else experience this??? like i feel my life is going ok rn and then I get hit with dread then I look for answers as to why and I end up thinking zombies climate world ending stuff and not sure how to cope with it. these dread feelings happen a lot at night too but when the dread feeling hits my mind wonders to all the bad and I was wondering if anybody else gets this as I have been struggling and I want to know im not alone.,Anxiety
52317,My Job Is Depressing Me I need helpinsight I started my first this job September of my last semester of college and I was excited to have such a great opportunity. From day one I have felt very little direction at the job. I had one day of training on one of the four projects I was to oversee. The previous person in the position had left already and I was trained by someone filling in for the moment. The training I got doesnt even scratch the surface of all that I have to do. Theres so many things dont know how to do or didnt know I was supposed to do. Ive read through my manual for help and theres not enough information. It seems me asking for help from my colleagues is unwanted and something is not clear between me and my bosses. Its like the expect me to know things I was never shown. Ive only been trying to learn the system for 7 months which I do understand better now. I feel trapped and punished. I dont reach out then will always be lost. I reach out and its a surprise. This my first legitimate job and I cant tell whether or not Im not good enough or if I was put in a bad situation. I want to like my job but I honestly really dislike it due to never knowing completely what Im doing. I have no helpand Im on edge everyday thinking about my job.,Anxiety
52318,How to stay calm when my whole body goes numb? Hey guysso one of my anxiety symptoms that sometimes happens is that large parts of my body just go completely numb mostly my arms legs chest neck and face.Right now it's happening again and even though i know that it's most likely just my anxiety my brain knows that numb nerve problem and that's what i can't get out of my head I am so worried that one day i actually do have something with my nerves but i ignore it thinking it's just anxiety and then i stay permanently numb because i didn't go see a doctor....And what if one day i have a stroke and just try to ignore it because oooh anxietyHow am i supposed to know the difference between my brain tricking me and an actual emergency??I'm trying to calm down but i keep touching my numb parts to feel if they are still numb ,Anxiety

While that releived me the pains have gotten worse. My muscles are aching heavily in my shouldersupper arm my upper back chest and stabbing pains in my heart.

52321,Anxiety with OCD My first time posting here and I just needed some place to vent. I've been on sertraline since I was 11 28 now. My anxiety ties into my OCD I tend to wash my hands a lot double or triple check if something is where it needs to be. I also have health concerns for exampleI bought a posture strap helper. I was adjusting it and peeling the velcro back. Something splinter like jammed into my finger. I'm assuming it's part of the velcro as it's really strong. My anxiety and OCD has been going wild since then. Heck I even put antibacterial ointment and a bandaid on it after washing it! I'm returning the product and emailed costumer service. This condition can be so tiring. I joke with people that I feel like a hostage negotiator while also being the hostage taker and hostage. OR the Spiderman meme. I just needed to vent and put things into words on how my mind is doing.,Anxiety
52322,Surgery on nose Anyone with anxiety around surgery have nose surgery. My main way of calming myself is 478 breathing or 4box breathing and am a little nervous that my nose will be all blocked up. Guess I better start my mouth breathing.Also get anxious when on pain killers like I am out of control. I cant relax and get anxious that the fatigue will cause me to pass out I have the freeze response. My wife tried to remind me the pain killers are there to help and to let my body just handle it.Plus I hate the anesthesia part when they cover your mouth in the waiting room. Not that Ill die just feels unnatural like a forced nap. My wife just reminds me that she would rather be asleep during the surgery just wish I could really take that mindset.,Anxiety
52323,Finally taking control of my Mental Health rather than letting it control me. The string snapped the tiredness anxiety and depression became too much so I decided to press pause and take some time out to recharge. I have taken sick leave from my job that exacerbated my anxiety I'm going to start on anxiety medication again I'm in counselling and I'm going to look at starting CBT. Enough is enough. It's time to get my life to how I want it to beI'm not being held hostage by my anxiety any longer.,Anxiety
52324,I find it so frustrating as a highly anxious and depressed person to do career tests because they rely on your passion for specific activities and I find myself answering I dislike it very much to the various questions e.g. working in construction healthcare finance whatever. I've been trying to get back to work again because it seems my severe depression and anxiety won't go away and there is only so much medication and therapy can help me. Of course I haven't tried every kind of therapy but what had been offered to me at low cost. But I've tried many medications.Anyhow I feel very frustrated because after trying couple of online part time jobs like writing marketing stuff on websites and finding myself not motivated enough to work sufficient hours to make ends meet I'm trying to start from zero again and do some career tests to find what motivates me. But those tests don't offer some magical information but just rely on what you're passionate about. Like they give you 50 questions and ask you how much you like doing different activities like installing cabinets diagnosing disease in people giving financial advice to someone wanting to get a loan helping a disabled person get dressed playing a musical instrument in front of an audience taking care of sick animals etc etc etc.I hate them ALL! None of these activities excite me. Because having a job is always about what others expect of you. But mental illness sucks so much of your energy that there is so little left for the job.Like if I'm a cashier my high anxiety and depression and the various thoughts and emotions and physical symptoms I experience will take so much of my energy to control and nothing left to put on a smile and make a customer feel welcome and at the same time do my job of scanning items very quickly and correctly.That's why I've been trying to find jobs that are just online and things I can do on my own time so that whenever the damned mental health issues give me a break then I can do the job. The problem is there are too many people doing these jobs and they pay so little that I've had to start looking at other options.Damn it I don't know what I want to hear from you to be honest I mean I already am so filled with selfhatred and hatred for the world I am working myself into anger just writing about it.,Anxiety
52325,Driving suggestionstips that helped me I hate driving to new places and this has helped me tonsPreresearch the address if the time is flexible what times are the least busy google maps is a good one to check. Is the destination open check the website ahead of time. Use Street View to check out the entire route. Get your nav app all ready. Ive found that Apple Maps if you have this is amazing because it will say things like dont make right after this stoplight. Make a right at the next one. The destination is in the right pull into the next driveway on your left etc. Leave with plenty of time to spare. Assume you will make a few wrong turns. Give yourself extra time to lose your way. Research parking ahead of time. Use apps like Parking Hero. Use the citys websites to find out the capacity of municipal parking ramps if available. Scope out street parking with Google Street View too. Find alternatives to parallel parking. You can also park near driveways so you cant get parked in easy pull inout. Dress comfortably so that if you get stressed you wont get super sweaty. Make sure you have enough gas. Adjust your mirrors clean windows headlights for visibility ahead of time. Listen to calming musicdriving playlist. Get toll moneyEZ pass ready ahead of time,Anxiety
52326,Would all this be caused by anxiety? Hello everyone I'm a 20 year old Caucasian male. 59 155lbs. I don't smoke i don't drink alcohol nor use any drugs. So it's been almost 1.5 years that I've developed some strange symptoms that have really deteriorated my life.They basically started after i caught covid i was vaccined prior with the jampj vaccine. Since then i get heart pains all the time. They happen multiple times a day and usually last a few minutes before they go away. I've been to 2 different cardiologists who ran an EKG and echo and said that everything was fine. I also had a 48 hour Holter monitor that showed some pvc's 200a daybut docs weren't concerned at all. Also after covid my WBC are basically running around the 1113k range before that CBC's would come back fine. They were fine before i got infected but it's been almost 1.5 year that they won't go down. My lymphocytes are also high 4550 and neutrophils low 3540. Everything else comes back completely fine. I went to a hematologist and he run some tests for malignanciesleukemia but they came back negative. One of the worst symptoms also is the spasms I've been getting all over my body. They can happen literally anywhere and they always last a few seconds before they go away. I've searched a lot about them and i guess it's most likely BFS benign fasciculation syndrome. But it never stops. I think my nerve system has been permanently damaged. Lastly i get random aches in my stomach and usually at the upper left abdominal region. I've had an abdominal echo and it was fine. But i get random shooting pains along with painful gasses. These are the symptoms I've been dealing with the past 1.5 year. They're all so random and I can't connect them somehow. High WBC usually mean infection so I'm guessing that an autoimmune disease might have been triggered?I've also found a lump in my arm. It's been there for 1.5 year as well i showed it to my gp and he said that it's a lipoma but it's still there. It hasn't grown but it hurts sometimes. Things like sarcoma drive my mind crazy. It feels like my body is constantly trying to kill me. The whole thing is causing me so much anxiety and stress. I thought that things would get better with time but no nothing has changed and it's been so long. I'm only 20 years old and I'm afraid that I'm gonna drop dead by a heart attack or cancer. I used to be an athlete but i stopped after all these because i became afraid. I honestly can't live like this anymore. I've visited more than 5 doctors and nobody has a clue. Any ideas?,Anxiety
52327,I hate that doctors don't like prescribing Benzos I have Tinnitus and the only thing that puts me to sleep is Ativan .5 mg. I know people who've been on a low dose Klonopin for years and nothing happened to them. I hate SRRIs because they give you insomnia. It's frustrating that all they wanna give you is a bunch of off label medications that have more side effects than benefits. Everyone keeps saying 'yoga melatonin ba bla bla..'. They wanted me to take Gabapentin which is used for people with seizures.,Anxiety

52333,Too Anxious to get a formal diagnosis and medication I've struggled with intense feelings of anxiety for years and years now. I hesitate to say that I have an Anxiety Disorder because I've never been diagnosed but it affects my life so much that I can't be normal. I can't drive because I get too scared I'm always terrified when I'm being driven around because I feel like we'll get into an accident or the police will pull us over and I can't even call my family because phone calls scare me so much. I feel like I'm constantly living in fear and I know that I want a diagnosis to help me know for a fact that this is what it is and I really think that medication will help me. But I'm too scared to do it. I overthink about making appointments and if I have to call a doctor to make it it's an absolute nogo. I don't know how I'm supposed to get help if I can't even take the first steps. I'm currently in therapy which is amazing that I could even do it and it's the first therapist that I've ever seen that I feel actually vibes with me but I'm too scared to ask to try and get diagnosed.

52334,How do I stop overthinking and seeing for people for what I want them to be instead of what they are. I am afraid to make new friends because as soon as I meet someone new I start imagining how our friendshiprelationship will be like. I start planning where we will hangout the conversations we will have and how they would be like. I start getting excited over the fantasy of them that I created in my head and my brain makes me feel like I know them and that were already friends even though we just met. I then get disappointed when they dont live up to the image that I had for them and start panicking because Im like wait so now where never gonna be able to go to the beach like I planned or they take too long to text back they probably dont like me and Im annoying and I scared them away. I throw away all my self worth just for the opportunity to live the fantasy I created. Like this guy I like did not answer me for a whole day and I assumed he dislikes me and got upset he texted me eventually after a day and I knew I should not answer quick because for me he was a priority he shouldnt be we just met but my brains makes me thing Im closer to people than it seems. I ended up answering in like 5 minutes knowing I should not have because he did not answer me for a day but I did it anyways because I really wanted to hangout with him and live out the fantasy in my head of us hanging out and getting to know each other. How do I stop please I need help because this is exhausting and overwhelming and I am annoying and scared that Ill scared people away.,Anxiety

52336,My social anxiety has been getting worse For a while I thought I was okay. For a while I didn't feel socially anxious. I don't know what went wrong but the thought of social interaction or going out into public spaces scares the hell out of me. For a while I never went grocery shopping because I just didn't want to deal with people. I don't want to talk to my classmates at all. I would feel more better about hiding and not having to deal with anyone. One of the most recent issues that's sending me into a spiral is that I need to do a task that involves leadership and giving directions. But it's difficult for me to communicate. It's as if the words are all sprawled out in my head and whenever I make an attempt at talking it just comes across as disorganized and incoherent. I'm not a leader. I can't direct. I'd rather follow than lead. Today was especially horrible because I'm generally a well organized person who has it together but my classmate ended up seeing how much of a mess I am. After something fell out of my plan I got flustered shut down entirely. It's so embarrassing and now I want to hide from everyone. I don't know how to recover from something like that or show that I'm better than my anxiety.,Anxiety

When I was talking to her about my difficultmanipulative relationship with my dad and how he suddenly started ignoring me over the smallest thing she asked me how I felt about it when I said that I was feeling angry then she asked me what else? I said maybe also disgust of him then she again said what else? i got stuck for words because well thats it? im not sure that i feel anything else but she was waiting for the answer and I answered something like confusion then she again asked me the same question and I told her thats all. and this is the part Im not sure about she then said i think you also feel sadness tell me do you want to cut contacts with him? I told her that probably yes im ready for this and determined to do it. but she implied that this is not what I want and told me to think about it and tell her on the next session. since then i feel really uncomfortable with her and im thinking about leaving therapy. i dont know maybe i just overthink and its not what its actually like?,Anxiety

52341,separation anxiety in the recent few years i've very well acknowledged that i am a pretty anxious person and i kinda got used to it. but something that still bothers me is my separation anxiety and the constant fear of being abandoned by my friends. i don't know how to go about it especially now that i have a best friend to whom i can't talk all the time whenever i want or need to. they seem to be more of the avoidant style. i find it very difficult to go through my day if whenever i think of them and talking to them i have to stop myself and 'give them space.' i don't mean this in a selfish way naturally i am a pretty understanding person. i try to control my 'urges' for contact which i crave a lot but it's been getting harder as the days go by. most of the time i don't even have something important to say it's just my thoughts and things i mention throughout the day but i feel blue when i remember that they do not 'prefer' texting everyday because that is something that i really like want and need. i try my best to respect their boundaries and i am the one to 'adapt' to their needs for space. just recently i started wondering whether it is okay that i bring this up as a boundary and a need of mine. i feel like i've often been the one to change for them and it's been getting to me lately. i don't mean any harm to my bestie and we don't have any other 'unsolvable' problem except for this one. is it okay to text them? is it selfish? i get a lot of thoughts and i address them as anxiety but it doesn't get any easier even when i am fully aware of that. i just wish to put an end to this. it has been affecting my mood lately i check the messages app hundreds of times only to see no texts from them. i get anxious waiting for a reply and even more anxious when i first think of something to say. it just pops into my mind and i happily open the app but as soon as i start typing i remember the situation and feel guilty about texting them. but then again i feel very empty if i don't. how do i go about this?,Anxiety
52342,Relentless Nightmare since December! Hello allI am 22M and been struggling since December when I had a marijuana induced panic attack. First time smoking and I only did it to make my sister feel more comfortable with smoking since its something she enjoys. Like an idiot I took an absolutely heroic bong rip and had a full mental breakdown for the next 2 hours before I finally woke up and felt mostly normal. I felt okay the next day and then after a week I was very stressed at work and out of nowhere got extremely dizzy to the point I was scared for my life. I drove to the ER and they said it was just anxiety so I drove back home and tried to sleep it off. Didnt sleep at all for 3 days and was terrified the whole time. Since then Ive had constant derealization panic attacks intrusive thoughts depression anxiety and horrible physical symptoms like dizziness random headaches that come and go all over my head body pains stomach pain etc..Since then Ive had 2 rounds of blood work CT scan MRI seen an ENT and a neurologist. Ive also been given all of the following medications and more prednisone meclizine clonidine zyrtec flonase antibiotic ear drops. None have worked. All my tests have shown nothing physically wrong so Id say its fair to diagnose as anxietyrelated though my therapist Im new to therapy since this all began says hes never had a client with such severe dizziness and brain fog. Ive been on Zoloft for 6 weeks now and Id say it is finally helping somewhat. I have changed doses twice from 25 to 50 and 50 to 75 in that time so Im still adjusting. I was also taking quetiapine 25mg as a sleep aid for a few weeks but I can sleep without it now so I stopped because I wasnt thrilled about taking an antipsychotic for offlabel use to begin with.Overall I would say I am at about 2530. When I started the Zoloft I felt around 05 honestly. I was convinced I was going insane and would need to be in an institution during those first 2 weeks.I have been housebound and on medical leave this whole time so what Im trying to do to get back to my feet is exercise daily get outside drive to my apartment 1hr and work remote a few hours a day. I am soldiering through these tasks and honestly I do feel better when Im busy. For example when I play the PlayStation I can push the symptoms to the back of my mind. But the rest of the time it feels like my conscious mind only has 25 awareness while the rest of my mind is lost somewhere else and doing its own thing. It also feels like my short term memory and vision are impaired but theyre not. Its like being stuck in a dreaming state and its so scary and frustrating. Its very hard to describe but I dont have any delusions or hallucinations so I dont believe I am suffering from a psychotic illness. I have suffered through so much in my life without it physically impeding me or making me question my sanity but these last 3 months have really tested me. Over the last 4 years Ive struggled with anxiety and depression but I was able to power through 2 degrees a long distance relationship a breakup and building a career I would hardly have dreamed of years ago. I know I am strong and have what it takes to get through this but the battle is certainly long and difficult. It is unlike anything Id have ever fathomed a human could experience. It is so overwhelming that its easy to think it may never end. I think it will be okay over time because I believe in the power of the human mind and body to adjust to challenges but I wanted to share my experience and see what others may think. I will be so grateful when I am healed and healthy because this experience has given me so many insights on what it takes to have a happy and meaningful life. Ive learned lessons in gratitude kindness and compassion that I want to share with others.P.S.I really look forward to getting back to the things I enjoy once Im better bodybuilding soccer vinyls and working!,Anxiety

I did get diagnosed with panic disorder but I also know panic attacks arent the only thing I get and I can develop anxiety over many things. I started dating a guy early in 2022 and towards the end I had started getting anxious over texts and even looking at iMessage itself sometimes then I developed some anxiety and shakiness when I wouldnt hear back from him for a long time. It was a dark time for me and I noticed I started getting anxious and was having bad thoughts about myself. Now I met this new guy probably a week after I broke it off with my ex and hes great were not dating but definitely exclusive but from 5pm 9pm he doesnt message me for a long time and I understand hes eating dinner wants alone time for his own things but I hate having this shakiness in my hands and it feels like a rock weighing me down and Im shaking everywhere all over my body like I cant move. Sometimes I think the solution is to tell him hey can you text me back in x amount of time or I dont like how you dont message me for awhile sure short term solution but I know things will come up and hell eventually resent me for making him do that and this goes way beyond him as well. Even if we break things off in the future I dont want to have major anxiety over the next guy and go through these feelings again and again and I want a permanent solution. Help?,Anxiety

52361,It's like an unending barrage. If I thought I managed my anxiety poorly before oh boy. This last month has been easily the worst in terms of anxiety I've ever experienced. My first born is due in two months. Farming season is about to start. Constantly awake until 34 AM reeling about the real possibility of financial ruin due to the costs of having a child and the current state of the agricultural industry. The thought of changing careers only amplifies my anxiety x1000. That's the worst part being unable to sleep. Sometimes I'll start to go asleep and the slightest noise will wake me up or I'll just wake up in a full blown panic. I've been spending all day either being a nervous wreck and if I'm not outwardly nervous my body is still showing physical symptoms of it. Almost like it's subconscious. Sometimes I feel like the anxiety itself is scarier than the situation I worry myself sick over. My other new trigger is every little ache pain or cough I get I spend the entire day spiraling down a hole thinking I'm obviously dying and I won't be there to see my daughter's first steps and the farm that's been in my family for 5 generations will be sold because nobody will be there to take care of it. I hate the physical symptoms the most. The fast heartbeat constantly being on edge body and headaches. It's like even if I think I'm getting a rope around my anxiety it's still there in my subconscious wreaking havok on me. I'm sorry if this was convoluted or hard to follow. I just don't have many people I can talk to and if I can they have a hard time understanding just how hard this affliction makes things. These things I'm worried about are valid certainly anybody who isn't nervous about having a kid isn't in their right mind I suppose but having a generalized anxiety disorder coupled with panic attacks in the first place just makes it hell on earth and makes you not only question your own abilities but also question your own sanity at times.,Anxiety
52362,Anxiety seriously holding me back. Any insight is greatly appreciated. Hi everyone This is my first time posting on here and this may turn out to be an essay but please bear with me and read to the end. I promise to make this as concise as possible.I'm in my late 20's male and have had anxiety since the beginning of high school. It felt super overwhelming back then and high school could have been an amazing experience had anxiety not gotten in the way. I went to university fairly late and after graduating kept landing contract work and eventually got stuck working at the same grocery store I applied to as an undergrad. The anxiety carried over into the workplace and resulted in my inability to work at a fast pace. I always felt mentally and physically exhausted.This is where I have to mention alcohol and caffeine both of which produce superhuman like effects but with a caveatI tried alcohol for the first time in Montreal at the age of 18 and after downing 2 beers it felt like I had ingested an elixir. My worries went away instantly and felt my brain firing on all cylinders. There were 0 negative emotions and a profound combination of confidence energy euphoria and heightened creativity. I never got addicted to drinking for obvious reasons and only drink on occasion but every time I do it produces the same effects. I also never get drunk. Coffee seems to produce eerily similar effects and I realized this a few years ago after I had a coffee at work and felt like I had snorted crack. I thought I could take on the world and was super excited that I had finally found a solution to my problem. Unfortunately however if I have coffee everyday for 4 days straight by the 4th day it produces the exact opposite effects and I'm left feeling sleepy and lethargic. For me to feel the full effects of coffee I need to refrain from it for at least 7 days. Fast forward to today where I recently started working construction as a sprinkler fitterpipefitter and absolutely hate it. Apart from being a fastpaced environment I'm asthmatic with an allergy to dust and constantly drilling holes into a concrete ceiling has made my asthma worse plus the cement we use to glue the plastic leaves me with a pounding headache during and after work so I know my days are numbered. The company that I'm employed with is currently waiting on a new project so I've had the last 7 days off During this time I've begun doing research on career alternatives and have become very interested in the online world and have decided to upgrade my skills in ecommerce digital marketing and video editing among other things. My morning routine involves getting up at 8 o'clock feeling tired having breakfast followed by tea with milk which produces similar effects to coffee with much less intensity. After having tea my anxiety goes away and I become very focused however when the caffeine wears off my anxiety returns and I go back to feeling mentally exhausted constant worrying overthinking fear of failure lack of motivation etc.As far as I know I'm not depressed nor do I have low selfesteem. I feel good about the way I look and the shape I'm in. Going to the gym helps. I don't have any bad habits. I don't smoke nor do I indulge in social media looking for a dopamine fix. Most of my free time is spent reading online and on YouTube searching educational videos. I also get 7 to 8 hours of sleep every night but usually wake up tired. The only complaint I have with life is my anxiety. Without it I have a powerful personality and I feel like I'm capable of achieving so much but it's causing me to operate at only 50 of my full potential.I was wondering if anyone is able to offer any insight as to why alcohol and caffeine produce such similar effects practically eliminating my anxiety before the effects wear off and if anyone has had similar experiences? Could alcohol and caffeine contain something which I might be deficient in? Could I get this in a pill form?I was thinking of making an appointment with my family doctor but just thought I'd reach out here to see what the members here have to add. I'm open to the idea of trying antidepressants but at the same time worried about the side effects. Do antidepressants really only cause side effects in the first couple of weeks? Based on some of my research that seems to be the case. Apologies for the long post and I would greatly appreciate any input. Thanks.,Anxiety
52363,Blonde highlights Hello first time posting here but I feel like I'm going to explode.So a few weeks ago I got the amazing idea to get blonde highlights like a balayage. I don't know if it's because how the hairstylist did them because my hair is wavy or I'm just this insecure. But now every time that I see myself on the Kinrara I hate my hair so much like what the he'll I did to my precious color.I'm thinking to get dyed at home because I can't deal anymore with hairstylists and giving explanations but it makes me SO ANXIOUS to not get a color that matches my hair. I just want my highlights to dissappear.I'm feeling like a mess and I don't know how to proceed and I don't want to hear the others saying how I'm wasting my money after getting the highlights . I just want to feel peace at something.,Anxiety

52366,Developed anxiety disorder out of the blue Dont understand why this is happening but I have been having panic attacks when Im stressed out. Its really weird. I do struggle with depression diagnosed but not medicated but never really had an issue with anxiety until now.I can only pinpoint one specific traumatic moment this year but I really am not seeing why especially when the trigger isnt anything related to that. I just shut down now under any stress which sucks because sometimes my work is stressful and the panic attacks have happened twice in my work placeI'm just wondering if anyone else had this sudden onset of panic attacks for no reason?EDIT I forgot to mention but Im in therapy and have mentioned this to my therapist but I am finding these episodes continuing to occur and it scares me,Anxiety
52367,How can I better handle my catastrophising Recently Ive become a lot more aware that when I overthink something I often dont look for evidence that that thing is true I instead simply catastrophise without receiving the information which actually may disprove what Im thinking. A common reaccuring thought in this is that my boyfriend is mad at me that my friends are mad at me and overall the overarching fear that Ive done something wrong. From personal experiences can anyone give me some personal self help techniques to reduce catastrophising and overall thoughts that are extremely blown out of proportion,Anxiety

Im at work constantly trying to clear my throat and googling how to cough up phlegm even though Im not sure that it is phlegm. I cant concentrate on anything else and Im worrying that I have a disease. I havent done any work in the last 40 minutes because I keep googling and getting up when Im restless. Considering leaving work early to go home but I know itll sound stupid. I also know that my reaction to overpowering anxious thoughts is to leave wherever I am and go home so I know the reason for wanting to go home isnt because I feel physically sick enough.I wish I could just sit with this mild physical discomfort and cough every now and then like a normal person but instead every time I feel the thing in my chest a wave of anxiety paralyses me.

52377,Inner Sanctuary of Peace Hello this is a short story that at least for me it was a great anxiety relief. If you like it I will post more. Once upon a time in a serene village nestled within a lush green valley there lived a gentle wise elephant named Elara. This village was known for its tranquility as it was graced with a unique energy that seemed to ease the worries and stresses of all who lived there.One day a young girl named Mia came to the village seeking relief from her overwhelming anxiety. Upon hearing about Elara's wisdom she ventured to the peaceful grove where the elephant resided. The moment Mia approached she felt her heart rate slowing and her breath deepening.Elara I've heard of your wisdom and calming presence. Please can you help me with my anxiety? Mia asked timidly.Elara looked at her with gentle eyes and replied Of course dear child. Sit down beside me and let me share with you the secret to finding peace within yourself.As Mia settled down Elara began to tell her a story.Long ago our village was visited by a wise old monk. He too had experienced the tranquility of our valley and wished to uncover the source of this peaceful energy. He spent many days meditating under the ancient oak tree at the center of the village. Finally he discovered the secret within each of us exists a tiny peaceful oasis an inner sanctuary that remains untouched by the chaos of the world.The wise elephant continued To access this sanctuary you must learn to quiet your mind and listen to the rhythm of your own breath. Begin by taking slow deep breaths inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. With each breath imagine your worries dissolving into the wind leaving only peace and tranquility behind.Mia closed her eyes and followed Elara's guidance. As she inhaled and exhaled she felt her anxiety ebbing away replaced with a sense of calm and safety she had never known before.After some time Mia opened her eyes and looked at the wise elephant. Thank you Elara. Your words have brought me peace and I will carry this lesson with me wherever I go.As Mia prepared to leave Elara touched her trunk gently to the girl's shoulder. Remember dear child your inner sanctuary is always within you. Whenever you feel overwhelmed or anxious simply close your eyes breathe deeply and allow yourself to find refuge in the peaceful oasis of your heart.With newfound strength and a heart filled with gratitude Mia returned to her life carrying the wisdom of Elara and the tranquility of the village with her. She had discovered the power of her inner sanctuary and now she was ready to face the world with courage and serenity.,Anxiety
52378,Advice? tw selfharm bad thoughts? I'm not really sure what else sorrySo uh I've been feeling down and really anxious for thr past few weeks. It's probably silly but I cut myself a while ago snd I hadn't done that for a while so I think it's really getting a low point. And it's probably just because of my poor emotional regulation stuff but I kinda need to get this out because I don't have anyone else to talk to about this.To start with my academic workload's increased these past few weeks. I'm doing a research paper with a group but it's just stressing me out. I'm um overthinking about how it would fail? Or if I'm not a good leader and I'm affecting my classmates' grades because of it. It's just well the thought of it is always there and I can't really get rid of it because it's not yet done. Then there's this family tree project that we have and I'm using my mom's family with it I'm not really close with my dad's side of the family so I can't exactly switch to his family. Uh the problem is my mom has problems with her family and I don't want to bring it up so I keep putting it off. I don't want to make her upset and the thought of doing so is just making me anxious.There's also the little things. Exams quizzes presentations etc. I failed a quiz for the first time in a few years and my teacher got upset about it so I'm kinda panicking and trying to review more hahaThen well my birthday's coming up. We had this whole catering thing going on but there's been problems with the payment and stuff. Mom made a mistake because she was outside when the manager asked for the payment and she got really stressed because she couldn't get her money back. The manager hasn't exactly been cooperative and they've been insistent on the payment so yeah. Mom got angry and kinda blamed me cause I was the one who liked the idea of the catering thing. I promised her that I would take care of it since it was mostly my fault since she didn't like it but I pushed so I've been in contact with the manager and everything but the situation's still messy. It's just more stress? More anxiety. Hooray I guess.We're still not done with the preparations and stuff and I really want to help but I've been busy with school and when I get home there's no time to go outside and get what's needed. It's stressing Mom out and I think that's part of the reason why she got angry so I wanted to get this done. But I can't and I have to wait for the weekends to actually be able to do stuff.There's also the scholarship tests although I've already taken them. It's just making me nervous because if I didn't pass then it would be difficult to go to college becaude my family isn't really financially stable. It's just pressuring me? I think? I'm having trouble identifying how I feel without wanting to break down lolIt's also hard to fall asleep. I feel like the only rest I get is the minutes before I fall asleep so I try to prolong it as long as possible. I think I'm afraid of waking up tomorrow because it just means that nothing's resolved yet and I just. Yeah.Uh that's it I guess. Sorry if this is all negative. If you have some advice especially about the sleeping thing it's all welcome! Thanks.,Anxiety

52391,Sleep tips for Anxiety and Stress Recently Ive been going through a really stressful period of my life and it has also greatly increased my anxiety. This makes it especially difficult to sleep. I often take 2 hours laying in bed to fall asleep and then wake up about 34 times a night and I cant even tell you the last time I got a full 78 hours. I often wake up due to vivid dreams or maybe just due to all the things on my mind which I think may be contributing to poor sleep I often have to take a melatonin in the middle of the night to fall back asleep. I also take magnesium supplements sometimes but Ive had my ups and downs with them as they tend to increase the vivid dreams I also quit weed sorta recently which may factor into why Ive been having so many vivid dreams and having sleep troubles Im wondering if anyone has any advice on how I could get better sleep and any other supplements that may help with it if needed.

Later on I get a commenter basically undermining my symptoms like every doctor is telling me my symptoms arent sinus related which they are and ended it by basically saying its my anxiety and all in my head. I check his other comments to people and they were equally as rude and trying to humiliate people. I reported them to the mods and I was met with one of those most immature people to walk the planet. They told me that my complaint was ridiculous amongst other things banned me from the group muted me from messaging them and then now reported me to reddit for harassment.

52409,Coming to terms with anxiety as an adult looking back it was pretty obvious and nobody talked about it. Hi friends new poster here. Turns out my entire family suffers from anxiety and nobody shared this with me. My mom was medicated for it briefly my dad is medicated for it and also has PTSD and it runs in both sides of the family. I figured it out in my early 20's and I have been seeing all these things about myself in a new light ever since. Currently suspicious that I might have ocd.Something I am frustrated with is that I had a lot of signs and symptoms but was quieter than my siblings so it got brushed off all the time. In highschool I had one friend and she was always telling me I was a worrywart and openly mocked me about things I did. For example I could never just cross a street. Had to be with the walk signal and then I would RUN across it and one day she made a big deal about it to my faceNobody ever asked WHY. Why I had almost no friends why I didn't learn to drive until I was almost 30 why I am always going around giving people warnings about their safety. One time I had a complete breakdown after my parents got divorced which was very rare for me. And my mom said she's just being dramatic and wants attention and that was the end of that. I was also the responsible one. They just don't have time for my feelings.I try to talk to my dad who seems like the person who would understand the most and I'll say I have been figuring out some stuff about driving and being anxious and he will go SPEAKING OF ANXIETY AND DRIVING YOUR SISTER HAS COME ALONG SO FAR IN HER DRIVING! Or I will try to tell him I think I might have ocd and he will use this tone of disbelief and try to poke holes in what I'm saying to him.Sorry for the long post. I'm just grateful that sometimes I can find places on the internet to talk about it. I don't have the worst anxiety in the world but it's always there all the time. I appreciate that you folks are able to take it seriously. Thank you for that.,Anxiety

52423,Help for when your anxiety turns physical? I've had panic attacks and such but one thing that's a bit more off and on is how anxiety affects my stomach. When I had daily stomach pains in elementary school that were unexplained it now makes sense that it was definitely anxiety brewing.I'm going through a period right now where my stomach is just revolting against me. I have the urge to go just about all day every day and will sometimes go 24 times a day when my usual is once a day plus it's now usually loose which wasn't an issue before.The only thing I've found to kind of help is Tazo Zen tea. It does ease the stomach upset a bit but I also can't drink THAT much of it before making myself nauseouseven more sick. How does everyone deal with this in terms of their anxiety? I only have this issue on weekdays when I have work I'm usually normal on weekends so it's obviously the anxiety. I just feel tortured by my stomach right now. I also meditate which only helps for me while I'm actually doing it so the anxiety comes right back as soon as I open my work computer basically. Anything soothing for the stomach would be great... although I will say I am currently dieting wedding in June and trying to stick to lowpoint foodsdrinks on WW.,Anxiety
52425,Does your anxiety affects your self confidence? I found out that in times where my social anxiety was really bad this would also heavily influence my own self confidence and self worth.

52432,I need help with quitting job This week I started a construction job I wasn't 100 sure about.My coworkers and supervisors are nice people but the job isn't what I expected.Some tasks were understated when I applied for the job and in the interview but the tasks actually require a significant amount of my daily effort. Also I'm underpaid relative to what I was paid in my previous job as well as no paid break. However the job is 30 minutes from my house so cheaper public transportation. So because they're nice to me patient and welcoming I feel very uncomfortable telling them I'll quit even though the job contract says neither party has to give notice. Also I've always been an agency worker and the idea of having to give 23 weeks notice provides endless anxiety. In an agency job I could just phone or text and say I won't return the next day. I have no experience telling my supervisor I'm leaving a job,Anxiety

I like her a lot she is really pretty I have no idea how she feels about me but the past two girls Ive been talking to I never was really upfront about how I felt in the slightest and they both have found their own relationships and it really made me angry with myself for not being honest. Granted Im not actually saying I like her in the text or anything but I feel it would be implied lol. But any advice would help. We send each other homework and help each other in class but thats it. She is really awesome.I really dont mean for this to be awkward lol but it probably is anyway. I was trying to tell you in class yesterday without everyone hearing and turning around but I thought you looked really beautiful and I just chickened out and didnt say it for some stupid reason.

Now I live in fear and things that I liked to do before I have stopped doing or I don't do them for fear that it will make me anxious.Among them I always planned to travel as much as possible with family and friends the day I had a stable job and recurring income. Well now I am in that situation but I do it for fear of getting anxiety outside the house not being able to control it and the situation exploding.I still remember the panic attacks I used to get for no reason I had no reason to and I shudder....

52456,Scared I have MS Hey I have been having really bad health anxiety for the past week in a half. Pain started in my right index finger. I thought it was because I write and type a lot so I started to rest it. Over the past week my finger has gotten better but other parts of my body have really been hurting. One day my shoulders were killing. One night I woke up and my back was killing. The next day my legs were in so much pain. Now I am just feeling a bit of pain in my back. I am not really active and nothing traumatic happened to me either. I think I just have anxiety in general but these pains are really freaking me out.I also got blood work done today so I'm waiting for the results. I shouldn't have but I have been searching up my symptoms online and it kind of sounds like MS with pain moving around my body.

52457,Diagnosed with Anxiety? Is it a real thing or comment about struggles? I got my discharge letter from child mental health services and it had the usual things in. But it then had a paragraph saying it's important to note the patients diagnosis of ... And anxiety a different psych told me the anxiety is from a different disorder I disagree but still it seems weird I wasn't told or discussed with about it. And only anxiety a close family member has GAD and another has social anxiety but never heard of it like how they wrote it. I don't really care what label is put on me for myself but my new mental health team is going to get this letter and prescribe medicationtherapy accordingly. As I do really struggle with anxiety I'd like to get help for it but this seems like it's not a legitimate things and just a passing comment.If it helps they removed eupd from the original psychiatrist and added anxiety is it just people don't like diagnosing bpd so used this as a substitute? I live in care so although I don't like having the label bpd it does give my support workers different expectations emotional disregulatuion abandonment issues destructive behaviour.

52458,How to get over embarrassment over having an anxiety attack at work? So the other day I had a full blown anxiety attack at work. All of the sudden my heart started racing my whole body was shaking so bad I felt like I couldn't breathe and I was terrified. The fact that this was happening at work made it 1000 worse. I was with a coworker and had to run to the bathroom for like 10 minutes to try to calm down. I barely calmed down but went back out to help customers. I was probably obviously shaking like a lunatic but I did my best to work through it. I was honest with my coworker and told them what was going on.This is a job that I've been doing on and off for several years. Nothing bad happened but my life has been chaotic lately and it just snowballed right then and there. How do I get over the embarrassment of this happening not only in front of my coworker but customers too? I still don't know if my coworker told my boss but if they had I'm sure my boss would have reached out by now. The last time I had an anxiety attack this bad was about 2.5 years ago. So it's not a common occurrence but when I go back to work I'm afraid of it happening again or about repeat customers commenting on it. I just feel so ashamed and like a total loser. I'm in my mid twenties this shouldn't be happening. I want to hide in bed forever.,Anxiety
52459,Evening Scaries? Hi Friends I'm struggling with the evening scaries.I am an Aphant inner monologue only zero visual abilities factbased recall exclusively. I'm struggling in the evenings. Typically it would be called something like the Sunday Scaries I'm experiencing. However it is every evening now. To my knowledge I do not dream at all in any traditional sense. I'm feeling a physical visceral reaction to going to bed. There is an overwhelming anxiety to it that is almost paralyzing. It has been happening for a while but now I'm ready to mention it to yall. Once I get to bed I fall asleep no problem. It is getting there. It's terrifying. For some reason my body refuses to go. I have anxiety but this doesn't feel like worse. It feels like something else a sense of dread or fear. What I've tried cut caffeine out eat a proper supper and have recent blood work done. Breathing exercises tea etc. I'm doing the things I can think of to help. But I can't shake it. Everyone's kneejerk is to visualize me somewhere else and well..... I can't. Any feedback would be incredibly appreciated!Right now Im sticking to a Xanax unisom and melatonin to get me to bed.,Anxiety

Deep breathing exercises? Doesn't work. Try exercising. Kinda works but it comes back shortly after my workout. LTheanine? Heard great things about it. Makes my anxiety worse. Oh what about Magnesium Glycinate? Makes my anxiety worse. The only thing that helps me personally other than prescription drugs which I am trying to stay away from is hiking in nature on a sunny day. But even then as soon as I leave it comes back. I know everyone's symptoms are different but shortness of breath is the main symptom I experience. Even saying a sentence these days I feel out of breathe.

52462,Anxious about wisdom teeth removal For context I'm 17 I have nasty anxiety and next Wednesday I'm getting all 4 of my wisdom teeth out. I'm going under general anesthesia and this will be my first time. I've been pretty anxious about the whole thing but as the days creep closer it's been getting worse. I talked to my mom who is a long time nurse about my anxieties and she gave me plenty of reassurance but it's still just freaking me out.I'm more worried about the anesthesia than the surgery itselfrecovery. Not worried so much about not waking up but the whole idea of anesthesia as a whole just scares me. Something about falling asleep immediately and not being in control has always made me anxious. I also know all those dumb videos are mostly staged but I'm worried about not being able to control my mouth once I wake up not sure how loopy it'll make me.So yeah that's it. if you guys have any advice or anything I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.,Anxiety

52468,asking someone to repeat themselves is anxiety inducing so today i went to get my nose pierced. the guy piercing my nose spoke at a low volume at times so it was hard to hear what he was saying to me. there were two instances where i felt very anxious after asking him to repeat himself.first he said something to me while i was signing something. i said hmm? and stared at me for a few seconds before saying nevermind. from that moment on i was anxious thinking about him talking more and me not being able to hear him.he did end up talking again. he asked me which side i wanted the piercing on. i said hmm three times because i just couldnt hear him. he stared at me for a few seconds before saying it one more time slowly and in a seemingly annoyed tone. i was so ready to leave the shop. he said to come back if i had any issues with my piercing.. i really hope i dont have any. im already thinking about me not being able to hear him again and him staring me down while looking annoyed.i really feel like i annoyed the guy but i didnt mean to. i just couldnt hear him well at times. this happened at 3pm. its 1am rn and its still bothering me..,Anxiety

52473,Time for my checkup. Very anxious after I had a cancer scare last check up. Tips? Trigger warning talk of cancer Im 30f and I like to think Ive somewhat defeated my anxiety. I used to have awful panic attacks daily and Ive been panic attack free for months I cant remember my last one. But as my checkup approaches my anxiety is starting to return and im noticing my techniques are working less and less. My last check up in October seemed totally fine then I got a call 2 weeks later saying something wasnt right and it might be cancer. After 6 weeks of waiting and biopsies it wasnt cancer but was the most advanced stage of precancer. I had surgery and got the all clear for now. I will have to be checked every 6 months for 3 years. I got a call to remind me that I need to come in soon and Im just sort of freaking out. Knowing Ill be waiting around for 2 weeks just expecting to see that number pop up and tell me its back or its cancer this time. Any advice for when your anxiety is around something very real but also probably not likely my doctor thinks it wont come back and that Ill be ok.,Anxiety

52478,Sometimes I wonder if I will ever have a hold on my anxiety. I obsess a lot over having a passion. It's really dumb I know. But I think it's just my brain trying to find a sense of direction after a really bad depressive episode.It makes me go in constant circles trying to figure out what activity is going to magically put me on the fast track to happiness. Even though I know things are not this simple my brain still thinks of things in this way. It's really stressful to worry about what activities to do and what will make you happy in the long run instead of just living life. That's all any of us can do no matter how much we overthink. I am upping my lexapro dosage so hopefully that helps. I know it takes a month or so for SSRIs to kick in and I have only been on my new dosage for a week and a half but I don't feel much better. I have a therapist too and she hasn't been much help even though she tries. I have just been struggling with this weird obsession for so long and I have been through so many cycles I just don't think I will ever break out of this mindset.,Anxiety

52480,How do I keep myself from constantly coming into conclusion base on my intuition? Hi I'm Peter 20. Recently I've been thinking of bad things happening base on my intuition. Most of these bad things are related to my relationship with the people around me. I'm constantly thinking that they have something against me or they're betraying me. This started last year 2022 after the restriction because of the pandemic loosened. I had a group of friends that I was with and had a few drinks together had fun and typical stuff you do with your friends. After a fee months I felt something was wrong. Even though they are not showing it I feel it that they don't like me. I confronted them about it and they said no. But few days after that someone told me what they've been saying about me. I felt betrayed and sad. After that unfortunate incident I've been having trust issues and I trust my intuition more than ever. Now I'm talking to someone. He's sweet and gentle. He works hard and is independent. He talks to me even though he's tired I really feel that he's someone to keep. But today I just felt that something's wrong. He called me but he didn't speak. I called him back but didn't answer. I texted him what's wrong if he's okay. He answered me yupp. That was it not even an explanation. I don't know if I should tell this guy that what he did triggered my anxiety and I suddenly felt that he's unto something. I don't want to think much about it because I actually like him. Should I tell him after his shift or I should keep it to myself and see what the future holds for me?,Anxiety

52491,I really need some help with managing my anxiety when it comes to lack of cleanliness Hey everyone. I'm new here. I'm writing this to be very transparent and to ask for help. I don't want to ruin my relationship or participate in toxic communication habits. I am finding that my anxiety really acts up when my apartment isn't clean. My husband and I both aren't the best when it comes to doing the dishes as soon as we use them or cleaning up clothes right away. But I feel like I atleast take initiative and try. I feel he usually won't start cleaning on his own unless it's his own stuff or I practically yell at him to. I feel like I shouldn't even have to ask my partner to care about taking care of our home. I can't be the only one doing it. I'm honestly losing it because sometimes I get so frustrated and anxious I do get mad quickly. How do I change this? It's not even like I want to be mad it just happens because I've reached my limit mentally. I'm not on meds I wouldn't even know what to ask for.I feel like I just don't wanna have to ask him to clean anymore. Why can't he just do it on his own? I don't think I'm asking for a lot and I'm made to feel like a bitch or like I'm lecturing him when I'm all I'm doing is asking me to do some chores. In fact why do I even have to ask? I feel hopeless. I feel stuck. I can't afford a housekeeper every week right now. I can't control him. I just wanna know what I can do to manage my anxiety around this. And please no stupid advice like leave him because we are married. I know this issue can be fixed I just don't know where to start.,Anxiety

I feel stuck with a blocked brain that wouldn't get sleepy wouldn't get scared wouldn't do anything. Literally just blocked.

52495,My progress how I learned to live and progress with my anxiety. Ive had anxiety for years since I was very young I remember being afraid of everything and having phobias of germs getting sick heights flying driving certain foods etc. I was constantly scared as a child and eventually as I went off to college when I was 16 I slowly learned to live with my anxiety. I tried new things I slowly came out of my shell. When I hit 34.. everything came to a head I had gone through a major divorce at 33 lived through COVID under constant fear I was diagnosed with PCOS was moving across the country in May and was the heaviest I had ever been May 2022. By August 2022 I had lost 70lbs in almost two months because I was so afraid to eat I was basically crying every single day. I couldnt eat and refused to my emetophobia was so strong I could barely move everyday. I was in the ER multiple times having procedures and CT scans done and no one could find out what was wrong with me. It was then that I finally decided that I needed medication I talked to a psychiatrist for the first time. I felt like a failure I had been through so much but I couldnt break this fear and horror of food. Therapy wasnt helping and I had been so afraid of food that no one could get me to eat more than a bite or two for a whole day. I was prescribed medication because one of its side effects was to rise my appetite and at first it didnt work. I felt again so defeated and exhausted. They put me on a higher dose.. and after a few weeks I felt hungry. I had cravings again. I felt like finally eating and I was so famished I finally ate a piece of pizza because the cheese looked so good I couldnt not eat it.September 2022 I decided to start going to the gym I was scared at first I only would go in for 20 minutes 3 times a week. I was so weak I had lost all my muscle starving myself. October 2022 I went to the gym for the first time for an hour. I went up to the free weights and was discouraged but then watched some YouTube videos and started building workouts. I walked my first mile without pain. I was eating 1800 calories a day. I wasnt as afraid. November 2022 I ate out at a restaurant for the first time in months! I had nachos and they were delicious. I wasnt afraid! I had my colonoscopy and they found IBS and colitis. I finally had answers to my stomach pains. December 2022 I made a big Christmas dinner with my partner and roommate and I ate a full meal! I was now lifting at the gym 5 times a week. January 2023 I travelled out of the state on a plane! I ate out almost everyday! I enrolled back into school for my masters. February 2023 to now I workout 5 days a week and I walk 23 miles every single day. I keep my body on a routine for my chronic illnesses and I eat a focused healthy diet everyday.Some days are still hard some days have anxiety.. some days my stomach hurts and I have flare ups randomly. But every bad day has five times better ones. I focus on the positive I try not to be afraid of anything anymore. And even if I am? I remember it cant hurt me and Ill be okay tomorrow. I wish everyone the best of luck in your journey and recovery ,Anxiety

I've always felt so embarrassed and ashamed of these fantasies and I've realized i probably bave these fantasies cause all I've ever wanted was someone to notice how much I'm struggling and actually comfort me and understand how hard everything is for me. but these fantasies just make me feel like a terrible person. I've never admitted this to anyone just cause of how awful it makes me feel when i think about the reality of my fantasies.,Anxiety

I dont want to give much more details but I really struggle to talk to people unless they make the first move. It feels like Im a total outcast even teachers dont want to talk to me. I dont know what Im doing wrong I wouldnt say Im ugly or weird besides being quiet. What do I do and how do I stop being so anxious when saying even the smallest thing to another person.

52504,Any strange things you do when feeling anxious Started thinking about this today when out for a walk as I noticed myself constantly touching my bellybutton and stomach when I was starting to feel that tight anxious feeling. I seem to do this without thinking and I am sure to people walking past it looks a bit strange! I remember also in the past when I would get anxiety attacks or feelings of even slight panic I would start touching my neck maybe almost unconsciously due to my breathing. Not sure if it helps but when I am not able to do it easily say when driving or holding something I feel a bit worse if that makes sense. These habits have developed very randomly for me over time and seem to come out as soon as I start having symptoms of anxiety and anxious thoughts. Just thought I'd ask if any of you have any strange practices you do maybe even as a coping mechanism or way of bracing yourself when your anxiety is heightened. Anxiety is a strange kettle of fish but hope everyone is coping in their own way and getting through it one day at a time.,Anxiety

52507,Does anyone else suffer from dental anxiety? How have you cured it? I'm not talking about a fear of dentists. Though I have that too what I'm talking about is the fear of having something wrong with your teath. Worrying about every speck or black spot that I see. Checking my gums constantly to make sure that they are ok. I spend so much time in front of a mirror and a light checking to make sure there are no new signs of any dental issues. This is on top of brushing my teeth after everytime I eat usually. It's getting so stressful for me. To the point where I dont really have the energy to do things that I want to do or hobbies. How the heck do I get this under control? Does anyone else suffer from this. I think part of my fear is that A I've had bad experiences in the past with dentistsdental work. B I've started taking care of my teeth now but I'm worried old problems will show up. C I don't have the finances for something to go wrong with my teeth. I save as much as I can but I don't make all that much so yeah.,Anxiety
52508,SSRIs I had a drs appt this AM before work about starting meds for anxiety. Im anxious about taking meds in general and dont want to take SSRIs. Long story short I came prepared and specifically asked for one of two meds wellbutrin and buspar. The dr supervising physician refused to prescribe either. One bc im at a high risk of seizures bc family history alcoholism other meds... that was the one I wanted most bc it does depression anxiety adhd and helps w nicotine alcohol cessation. The other one was the only other anxiety med I was willing to try and they said no bc it doesn't treat depression only anxiety. The hypothesis is that my severe anxiety is the only reason I am able to function with slightlylesssevere depression so they don't want to prescibe it bc the fear is if they treat the anxiety but not the depression I will quickly spiral into a deep depression.I haven't felt this depressed in quite a while. I don't want to take an SSRI and it feels like my only option is that or panic attacks wherein I get so stressed out my blood pressure rises high enough to give me nosebleeds like an anime character.,Anxiety

52515,Ive been reading this vape study Im getting freaked out convinced Im going to die. My future is fucked and I feel like giving up. httpswww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpmcarticlesPMC8913014Hello 20M and I quit vaping 3 months ago after vaping for 4 years and I have no plans on going back. Picked up this habit in high school peer pressure and it continued because I was in the same group of friends since then. Vaped here and there in high school and every damn day in college. Chain vaping 55 mg nic salt pretty much. Obviously this is my fault but I cant help but think my future is uncertain and I probably fucked up my health. My lung has been feeling weird for a few months now and its causing me anxiety. Its getting to the point where I dont even want to do anything in college that could help my career because I think Im going to die in the near future. Like whats the point. Im convinced Im going to die from lung cancer sometime in the future or cardiac issues. Ive been having chest pain and its scary. I take an snri rn and its helping but the thoughts wont go away. Its getting to the point where Im reconsidering my whole life because I feel like I ruined it. Im very depressed and anxious about it and I wish I knew vaping was absolutely terrible for you before I even started. I know this post may seem dramatic but this is what goes through my head every morning until I sleep. I keep thinking it wasnt supposed to be this way. Ive gotten straight As my entire life been going to the gym eating right. Im in college about to go into a career path thats exciting and the future potentially could have been great but I have my one single vice that I was too stupid to quit. Damn idk I just needed to vent because it gets exhausting. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this kind of stuff. Obv my parents dont know about this they just think Im very distressed and depressed about school or smt. I see all of my peers off doing amazing things with their lives and Im just going through this bs. Its pathetic the person Ive become. Younger me wouldve died if he saw what I turned into. Throwing away life it seems like just for a little buzz. Ive been trying to get my friends off this shit too but they prob see me as biased due to my health anxiety with vaping.They are great but I cant help but feel I wouldnt be in this situation if I stayed away from the red flags. Once one person starts doing it its like dominos and no one thinks twice about it being bad. Damn my whole life building up to smt and I just jeopardize it over bullshit. I just needed to vent the health anxiety is getting bad to the point where Im certain cancer or a heart attack is coming and theres no point anymore.,Anxiety

It simply terrifies me. I want to support her. I have severe anxiety. I do take medication and get professional help. But its still hard.The thought of being home alone for 45 days roughly with my partner a 10 hour flight away in another nation worries me. I dont know what to say or do.

52517,Do you ever get intense chills with your anxiety? From time to time when my anxiety is acting up I start shivering almost violently. All of my muscles clench so hard that sometimes my abdomen begins to hurt. It usually appears to be related to feeling cold but not always. For example I had a cat attacked by a stray dog a little while back and before I could do anything to help her I nearly fell to the ground I got these chills so bad. I had to sit down and take a bunch of deep breaths before I could function.I couldnt even look at her or Id just start shaking worse. I think the correlation to the cold is psychological. I walk into a cold room or get out of my warm bed and it starts but usually only when Im worried that it might happen to begin with. Does this sound like a standard anxiety response to you all?,Anxiety
52518,Social media addict Tik Tok Algorithm freaking me out. For starters I procrastinate too much I manage to do okay but I know I waste time. Recently my Tik Tok has been infested with investment bankers and even scammer type video of people in their 20s making 600000k per year. I know the fallacy that social media is fake. But it is making me spiral a little. I go to a T100 law school which is decent and I have decent grades even an interview soon. I just feel I wasted so much time and energy and should have aimed to be making that 600 already. The legal internships Im applying for as full time jobs dont make that kinda money but still money Im comfortable with. But now Im thinking I need to aim for that for the sake of my struggling parents and my current gf who comes from wealth and doesnt currently work but loves luxury.,Anxiety
52519,How do I calm down and what should I do? For context I'm in high school. My anxiety has been super bad lately and it's been causing me to miss school a lot. My mom convinced me to go today and it was horrible.My science teacher is a great teacher but he can be pretty harsh sometimes telling us our year is the worst our generation is the worst smirking when we do badly on quizzes. Despite all that stuff I really do respect him as a teacher and he's good at the material.I just needed someone to vent to about him so I went to my counselor who I loved. She listened and offered insight but then I had to leave.At the end of the day my science teacher pulls me aside and tells me that my counselor told him everything. He said she told him that I said stuff that he doesn't remember saying it's definitely possible he doesn't remember but it did happen and that I was holding on to stuff from the past which wasn't true as he says similar stuff pretty much daily. The worst part is my counselor completely misunderstood one of my rants. She told him I was upset that he wasn't immediately able to help with something and that I had to wait. That wasn't at all true. And he said that he thought I would have understood so I explained she misunderstood and he seemed to believe me. I just think he believes I asked her to go to him for me so he's mad I didn't directly speak with him. He was really respectful one on one which I forget he is sometimes because of how he treats our class as a whole. I just feel really bad I don't always agree with him but I never wanted to hurt anyones feelings. I was just going to someone I thought I could trust to talk things out. I'm not even really mad at my science teacher I'm just frustrated that my counselor went behind my back like that. I feel horrible though. I cried for 2 hours and I don't ever want to go back to school again. I feel like such an awful person. What should I do and how do I stop replaying everything in my mind?,Anxiety
52520,Really struggling this week with my health anxiety wondering if anyone has the same issues? So I am on my last leg of a series of work trips away from home. I have 3 days left but the last few days have been terrible. I am constantly on edge worried my heart is going to give out to make matters worse I am waking up early in the morning in my hotel with a racing heart beat so my sleep is terrible. To make matters worse I am periodically getting pins and needles feelings in my extremities andor face which is further driving my heart anxiety. I am a 43 year old male that is healthy and only slightly overweight and had a physical less than a year ago with no issues and low cholesterol ect. Even with this knowledge I still worry I am going to die alone in my hotel of a heart attack and just cannot seem to get my head straight. Anyone else have this issue or have had it in the past? Could really use some encouragement and advice. I feel like I should go to the ER to double check everything is ok but whenever I do this I end up paying hundreds to be told it is anxiety related. Appreciate any advice as Im really struggling,Anxiety

52531,Severe guilt Does anyone else feel an overwhelming amount of guilt when feeling angry at other people? I think it may partially be rooted in my abandonment issues but recently my boyfriend had been kinda dickish but I never brought anything up cuz I kept convincing myself that it was my fault and that its not a big deal and Im being too dramatic. I brought it up finally at my tipping point and he said something that really hurt my feelings also dickish and I asked if I could have some space before we talked again. At the beginning it was fine but now Im starting to feel it again Im scared Im being too needy for him and that when I tell him I can talk hes gonna tell me he realized he doesnt like me so much anymore and we should breakup. Rationally I DOUBT this is gonna happen but I cant help but thinking its my fault?!? I feel so guilty.,Anxiety

52537,Bout of Bad Anxiety Should I consider Therapy. Over the last 2 weeks my 30M Anxiety had gotten worse to the point of finding it difficult to sleep no appetite tight chest can't focus on work and upset stomach. My doctor proscribed me some very low dose xanax for 10 days and also some other anxiety meds that take around 2 weeks to start working. I'm hesitant to take any of it though I don't want to feel dependent on meds and then when i stop taking them the anxiety comes back.My long term girlfriend and I broke up earlier in 2022 but we would sometimes keep in touch and see each occasionally. We went to college together but didnt date in college so alot of her friends are my friends also. She moved 6 hrs away for a job before we broke up and that was part of why we broke up along with other things. It was easy being with her from the friends aspect but deep down inside there were some things that really bothered me about our relationship. We always tried to make it work but it just didn't. She ended things with me but we are on good terms.She recently told me that she is seeing someone and ever since then it has bothered the hell out of me and have had all this anxiety since. Its making me think did I make the right decision in pretty much agreeing to break up to the point we spoke on the phone and she said sorry but it's over between us.I have gotten anxiety bouts before but its always about job deadlines or things that once over the anxiety goes away. This is different I know my relationship with her in a romantic way is over and the severity of this anxiety is much worse than anything I have felt. before.Should i consider going to therapy or will just pass in due time?

52546,how do i calm down when i get anxious while studying? due to mental health i've been slightly struggling with uni studies lately. part of why i'm mentally not doing well is because i've grown up with a rather abusive father and one of the things that he's really forced on me has been to do well in studies like that's just something that's been going on since i started schoolso this brings me to how extremely anxious i get while studying which usually is at home. it can take a while or it can take a few minutes but majority of the times i get so extremely anxious or just straight up have a panic attack in the middle of it. the part that causes this isn't that 'if i don't study well enough and pass this or that exam i'll struggle even more with uni' but 'if i don't study well enough and pass this or that exam i'll en up in trouble by my dad'ultimately i know it's always gonna be 'study for your own sake not anyone else's' but after growing up with a father that's so abusive in so many ways it's hard to not make that association and just break out until i can't even focus on studyingso my question is making that association or not does anyone have any advice on how i at the very least can calm down or put myself at ease when this happens while studying?,Anxiety
52547,Becoming hyperaware of your existence and feeling dissociated I'll add a little background first im a 35 year old male and have never had any diagnosed conditions or health problems in general. I have always been extremely shy social health anxiety low confidence never had a girlfriend no friends since I moved to a different part of the country when I was about 22. Over time I think I have been able to numb it down creating explanations and reasonings in my mind and used video games as an escape. For the last 10 years or so my life have beenampx200B Wake up and eat breakfast Go to work Come home and shower Make and eat dinner Some kind of workout Sit at computer Sleep and repeat Every other weekend I visit my mom who I spend quality time with and help out since she has a condition that keeps her from doing many things herselfampx200BBut a week ago i was hit like a truck with massive depression and anxiety realizing what my life have been these last 10 years. I feel like I have wasted so much time especially on the weekends where I was at home doing nothing instead of going to my mom or just doing anything productive. I got thoughts about existential dread death and what our purpose really is. I got crushing anxiety about my mom dying and me not spending enough time with her and also because she is the only person in the world that truly knows me understands me and that I can be myself with. ampx200BI feel like an alcoholic over 10 years who just suddenly stopped drinking from one day to the next now the video games do nothing for me I can't escape and I'm lost for purpose. My appetite is very unstable and my mind is racing especially when I try to sleep which has led to sleepless nights with my heart racing in panic and having constant disaster thoughts that I can't stop. I keep thinking Am I sick? Am I going insane? Do I have a brain tumor? and many more thoughts of that kind. I also get this weird feeling somethimes of being disconnected or dissociated to the world. I become hyperaware of my existence and my actions and thoughts and it makes everything feel weird. In this state I feel like im acting like myself when I'm with others like I'm something unexplainable controlling this physical body or seeing the world from a 3rd person view. Has anyone else experienced this or gone though something similar?ampx200BI have started on antidepressant and anxiety medicine and started seeing a psycologist but just wanted to share in hopes of getting some feedback or tools to combat these things.,Anxiety
52549,I feel like I'm having a heart attack again I'm 23 years old and I suffer from cardiopobia. I ate more sugar today than I've eaten in over two months and my heart is racing super fast.

52550,Health anxiety Im a type 1 diabetic and in my teenage years it was a rough time where I fainted multiple times because of low blood sugar some of them was so bad where I ended in a diabetes coma and other my family was pretty sure that I wouldnt make it I could get up in the morning and be completely dizzy not knowing what was going around I would look at my watch and not understand what time it was I got mri scanned and everything was fine. While being young and dumb I didnt really care and I thought I was immortal living life with 200 kmp even though my body was screaming after a break. A few years later in 21 I caught Covid19 a pretty bad one and I have got asthma afterwards while being sick with Covid19 I realized that I wasnt immortal at all I realized how vulnerable our body really is the thoughts started to getting into me from the times I fainted and my covid process. I have become afraid of everything and connects it with heart problems cancer brain tumor ect. My body cant be doing anything before Im convinced that Im getting the worst news soon Im always prepared to say I knew it its driving me insane the last few months it have been brain tumor that is making me going dumb because of a tension headache even though its probably just work related Im a teacher and because I sit and work in different positions that isnt great for either my neck or back. I dont recognize my self as said before I have become distend from my friends I never seen them or talk with them anymore always finding excuses to not get out of the house I stopped playing soccer guess why? Because Im thinking I will be getting a cardiac arrest if I do so. It have been hard the last 2 years causing stress depression and healthy anxiety not diagnosed yet only with stress. I know I need help but how do I get it? Im not used to getting help I have solved my own problems ever since I was a kid. Do I just call the doctor and say hey I think I have a depression and bad health anxiety or what do I even say? This really sucks..,Anxiety

52562,scared to start meds scared of feeling off So i have been suffering from awful derealizationdepersonalisation anxiety ocd and panic attacks for a couple of years now but its always come and gone. Ever since last year after going through a traumatic event its shifted my entire life to now only being able to focus on my anxiety. there are days that i get better and days where i have bad flair ups. I actively go to therapy and have recently started seeing a psychiatrist and nutritionist to see if i could figure out how to solve all these issues especially the derealization as it causes me to feel so out of it and almost high 247 as it has been prevalent for the last year especially now. I have been prescribed zoloft before but I had the absolute worst adverse reaction to it and has made me terrified to start any ssris. Recently my psychiatrist had prescribed me prozac but my therapist and nutritionist advise me against it as they do not think that my case is that severe. Where I am currently having an issue with is the fact that my biggest fearocd trigger is not feeling normal such as the fear of weed and I typically stay away from alcohol as I do not like how i feel when I drink. I am so scared to start meds or even vitamins that contain magnesium because I am so afraid of the high feeling or derealization feeling but now dont know where to go from here. If anyone has advice on how to get over this substance ocd I would greatly appreciate it.,Anxiety

52566,How did you overcome severe gym anxiety? Hello! I'm a gym newbie here and I've been really struggling with going to the gym. I have no excuses anymore. I've been telling myself that once I move closer to a gym once I get a good daily routine in once I get a job that starts later so on and so forth... well the stars aligned and I got a gym membership! No more excuses.Except I've got some sort of gymphobia. I have always felt this way even went a couple times as a teenager with my dad. I was freaked out then too.I went once with my boyfriend right after I got the membership and I wanted to cry the ENTIRE TIME. I was SO selfconscious to the point it affected my movements. I wasn't focusing on lifting I was focusing on being quiet who could see me how light my weights were etc. I stared at the clock couldn't talk louder than a whisper clung to his side... It was a massive relief to leave and I subconsciously let out a huge sigh the minute the door shut behind us.Tried going just to treadmill the other day walked in and went straight to the bathroom because I was so ANXIOUS! There was only one treadmill being used but I was so worried he'd see me trying to figure it out. I got so shakey and almost started crying again so I left the bathroom and went straight home. I know for the sake of my mental health I need to overcome this even if I find out the gym just isn't for me. This is absolutely my anxiety particularly social anxiety and body dysphoria. What makes me anxious being near other people working out ?!?! seeing my reflection in the mirror using light weights THEY ARE ALL LIGHT so I am just constantly anxious lmao how long it takes me to set upfigure out a machine maybe someone else needs what I have and they are annoyed with me someone else using what I want and not know what to sub anyone talking to me in any capacity lmao my form I'm new so logically I know it'll be incorrect but other people may judge meI'm tempted to shell out money for a personal trainer and a therapist. I'm sick of my anxiety and my body as it is but I wanted to hear yalls advice.Since this has been causing me so much anxiety forever and it directly relates to my body dysphoria and anxiety I feel like overcoming this is going to be a HUGE breakthrough for my mental health. I'd really appreciate your insight.Thank you!,Anxiety
52567,Health anxiety germs worry Tonight I met with a friend that I havent seen in a long time. We had a great time had a few beers and chatted loads. We then decided to have a cigarette. Yes I know its bad but its been a while since we had one and we were having a good time so went ahead with it. I accidentally dropped mine on the street and proceeded to pick it up and smoked it anyway. Its probably a few seconds after dropping and the pavement is on a relatively quiet area but still in a public areas. I didnt think much of it but after a few hours Im sitting here worried. I am afraid that I mightve caught something from smoking the cigarette dropped on the pavement. Ive always been a bit germaphobe so this is making my thoughts worse. I cant sleep Anyone here ever tried smoking a cigarette dropped on the floor? Sorry for the rant. Just cant stopped worrying.,Anxiety

52569,Why does my heart rate fall when I'm having an episode? Hey all Hope you're all doing alright today I've suffered from overthinking and general anxiety for a while. Being in my final year of university has been overwhelming to the point where I started seeking professional help. My doctor prescribed some beta blockers to me and asked me to take them when necessary I've not thought of taking them until today.I think I hit my breaking point today. I have way too much to do and I haven't been able to manage things well. I felt some aches and tightness in my chest and throat got cold hands and feet and starting stress sweating the smell was putrid. I could also feel my heart pounding in my chest. I decided to check my heart rate and I was surprised to find out that it was in the mid 50s. I didn't take my first dose of beta blockers and I'm waiting to speak to my doctor tomorrow. Has anyone faces this before? Shouldn't stress and anxiety cause my heart rate to shoot up instead of dive?,Anxiety
52571,I need some desperate help and maybe some words of advice. Hello I'm mason and As of lately since the start of grade 11. We where told we basically had to choose are pathway as in our job or related field anyways as of late I wanted to follow in my uncles path and become a personal investor and since he's already high up I'd have a job lined up for me as i get outta high school and more the only catch. I knew i had anxiety but ever since i choose what I wanted to do math is now associated with anxiety to make it worse I was labeled a troubled kid when i was younger in life so as a result we moved a lot and I never had a long friendship making me easy targets for people who love drama. So as i was growing I was taking speical classes since I had bad adhd aswell so I wasn't getting the right credited for really anything in life and was basically labelled a special needs since they never put time into me. as a result i started trying better and Finally was able to upgrade to college level everything in grade 10 keep and keep in mind I was in high school in grade 8 due to this special program and now they they teach me like any other kid. I've found it very hard to do anything since i grew up getting 11 attention now since High school math is broken and 50 u will most likely never use in real life depending on the career you pick although the one i wanted to get into was money related I most diffidently don't need trig etc anyways I really need help finding out how to coop with anxiety this only happens during math aswell So i know the trigger and i know hen i clam myself down and I'm very happy before math i do better during math. but for some reason anytime my teacher ignores me for example today I rasied my hand to kep my practice quiz checked nobody else had their hand up so i wait she see's says one second and goes to 5 different people none of them had their hands out and forgot that i eveen asked so i promptly left teh class and went outside to get air or i was gonna start crying for the stress angry anxiety and everything why are my emotions 10x whenever i'm in math is their even any way to fix this issue?,Anxiety
52572,Was this sexual abuse? Im F25 not sure how to write this. Ive never put down my memories to paper let alone tell anyone. A family member would do certain things between from what little I can remember the ages of 715. These things made me feel uncomfortable and I asked multiple times for it to stop to no avail. I want to protect their identity so calling them X. X never let me lock the bathroom door when I shower X walks right in and has conversations with me even though the shower doors are seethrough. This still happens now at 25yo. I used to lock the door when I was younger but X would use a coin to open the door and would leave it wide open so I just stoped locking the door and forget to every time now. X have always sneaked up the stairs and burst into my room on purpose. Dispute multiple times asking X to knock. If Im just out a shower and wearing a towel Ill always ask X to leave but X scoffs as if I should be less embarrassed and Im weak for being embarrassed about being naked. When I was younger if I would touch myself X would take enjoyment from bursting into my room and surprising me and made me feel dirty and mentally fucked up for doing so. X would also watch through a crack in the door caught them sometimes before bursting in. X would ask to see my breasts and say it was to compare mine to theirs and any time I said I didnt want to I was made to feel silly for being embarrassed like it was no big deal. X used to ask me to shower with them. Well over the age I needed anyone to wash my hair. Still asking me at 15. X would again scoff if I said no and plead for me to join them as if I was not wanting quality time with them. X flashes me still does and leaves the door to the bathroom wide open when they shower and sometimes calls me over to chat with them on purpose as if they want to see my reaction to seeing them naked. X would insist on checking me down there when I was younger and would put cream on me saying there was a rash but I never saw one. I remember getting older and being adamant that I could do it myself but X got furious with me. X gets into my bed without asking when Im in bed or when Im not and asks me to cuddle them in their bed and gets angry when I say no. The next two are hard for me to typeI dont feel ready but this platform has been really supportive so far so here goes. For content X definitely physically abused me and still emotionally abuses me and I think they are narcissistic. Growing up and even sometimes now I go into a childlike mind and put on a higher pitched child like voice this cringes me so much so please dont say anything nasty about this. Once when I was around 16 I was hugging X in their bed and was in this childlike state. They played into it and said aww my baby do you want to suck milk and I for some disgusting reason that bothers me to this day I nodded and X got their breasts out and I .I cant type the rest but I dont think I need to. Again difficult to put down to writing. This one I dont know if its in my head. When I was younger X would ask me to sit on their lap. I would feel or think I did them pushing up their private part on my body. I would feel uncomfortable and would sit in a different position but it would keep happening and I learnt to ignore it. Sorry for the left hoy post but because this is not obvious or classic case of sexual abuse I think Im just unsure if it was. I know this person would take it very badly if they knew I was thinking this and I feel like Im betraying that persons honour or something. Context been depressed since 1112 and after experiencing panic attacks for the first time at 25 I finally told a doctor and Im on a waiting list to get help for pdsd unsure if thats what I have and I dont know if its worth mentioning this if its stupid or a lie or if I am even able to. I also struggle to enjoy sex unless its bdsm Im not sure if thats related but I just feel dirty if I am wanting it.,Anxiety

52587,Just had one of the worst anxiety attacks of my life during my sleep that I still cant comprehend what just happened. Ive had an anxiety disorder most of my life and I had a particularly stressful day the night before. As of writing this I just had the most vividly intense nightmare of my life that it still doesnt feel like Ive awoken into reality at the moment. In short I had a dream where I was being possessed by a demon but I could feel all the pain and physical anxiety it was creating. I woke up multiple times. One of the times my mouth was wide open my throat completely dry and my neck as stiff as a rock. During the dream I felt my heart racing and beating so hard my chest still hurts and I woke up completely covered in sweat and my body aching real bad. Is this a normal experience for a panic attack at night? Would anyone be able to provide some advice for why this couldve happened and how I can prevent it in the future?,Anxiety

52590,Can't think of a suitable name for this post I have been blessed with the ability to freak myself right the Famp out whenever i think about a host of different topics... anxiety. Now most of these topics ive been able to find categories for and address in that way by learning about those things bettering my understanding of them and really evaluating exactly what it is that im afraid of. For example i am a hypochondriac i have lived with health anxiety for as long as i can remember but its very easy to find out what health anxiety is you can easily find other peoples experiences common coping mechanisms potential causes for this anxiety etc. This is the case with almost anything i find myself consistently anxious about.NowOne of the darkest corners in my mind that i try to stay out of as much as possible is one that i cant get a lot of information on and because of this i don't know how to move forward in addressing this.This anxiety fear is triggered by thoughts of existence reality the thought of consciousness... trying to wrap my mind around what it is that I'm experiencing just by being alive in the first place. A good example thought of this would be thisWhether you are reading this on a computer or phone or tablet... stop and take a second to think about what is between your eyes reading this and the screen Infront of you now i don't mean the air pollen dust particles etc. that occupies that space but the fing space itself. How? why is that there? what is that occupying? how did it get there?I experience symptoms of derealization depersonalization disorder that I've observed are closely related to my thoughts like this Hell I believed when I was 17 until 20 I was falling into psychosis due to my relentless obsessing over the unanswerable. Its not even one specific mindF that does this to me it's the combination of all of them that represent what we call reality or existence that i cant tune out and the more i try to research these things in my life the more questions that are left unanswered. i can barely hold conversations with people because of how often i just go blank returning to being consumed with mulling these things over IN THE MIDDLE OF CONVERSATIONS.I feel like most people are able to just curb these thoughts as unimportant or just set them aside because there's no way to answer things like that at the moment. Boy do i wish i could do just that. Thoughts like this are 258 on my mind I mean I DREAM about inexplicable things that could never be answered and i wake up open my eyes and wonder what is this plane of existence that I'm experiencing? how do i retain my persona my memories my trains of thought all of my experiences after so many years? How do i face any interaction any experience any leaf that lands Infront of me on a walk without my mind jumping to the probability of these things happening? And then wondering how I'm even able to question that in the first place?This has not been a midlife crisis rather it has been a wholelife drain. I have never been afraid of the 18 wheeler next to me on the freeway yet i have always been afraid of the inevitable heat death of the universe. Why am I like this?,Anxiety
52591,Quick change in anxiety symptoms?! Hi guysI've experienced anxiety for a long time now 26F I'd say at least 8 years. Symptoms have always been tight chest heart going a million miles an hour the occasional panic attack. I've always managed it quite well have a decent job and can interact with people fairly well. I've never let it stop me doing anything as then I'd feel like it has beat me.As of 3 weeks ago it was literally one day fine and the next.. NOT FINE! I got on the train to go to work and felt like I was going to throw up. My mouth was watering and heart felt like it was in my throat. At first I thought it was food poisoning and something was physically amiss. Even though I haven't thrown up and logic would indicate I'm not going to it feels like I genuinely am on the verge everytime I am in a moving vehicle. I thought it would pass but it's now just part of my everyday life and I'm finding it debilitating. I'm scared I'll lose my job because of it which is feeding into the anxiety even more. The only way I can get through a train journey or any moving vehicle for that matter is by closing my eyes and putting on Bob Marley through my headphones. It's quite comedic but it genuinely is the only way I can slightly manage it. I've never enjoyed the commute and have done it for ages but now it's became a THING. I have to have a plastic bag with me at all times as the urge to throw up is so real. Has anyone else experienced a sudden and drastic change in anxiety symptoms how do you manage them? I'm scared I'll be this way forever.,Anxiety
52592,Constant anxiety and have lost feelings for partner? Okay so there's a lot for me to go through here and I have to apologise as it is hard for me to explain things as it's hard for me to even understand what's going on in my brain!I've been with my partner now coming up to 2 years in May wonderful healthy relationship where there are no issues whatsoever I'll preface this by saying I have struggled with mental health on and off throughout my life mainly being anxiety so I have been on Fluoxetine anti depressants for the last 2 years this has been great for me and has helped me to regulate my emotions and feelings quite well and to what I believe has helped my relationship with my partner to flourish and I have felt genuinely happy.Anyway cutting to now... Since the very very start of the year just after new years... obviously I noticed a lot of anxiety... although it may of been creeping in a few weeks before It was as though now I felt it full blast and my inner voice kept telling me that my boyfriend was interested in someone else and I was then getting strong feelings of them cheating although there was no indication of this I think on new years eve I had noticed my boyfriend getting on well with his mates and watching one of his friends who is a girl sing he's a musician and i know the following sounds daft believe me so the next day I kept getting intrusive thoughts of that moment and feeling very sensitive around it as I'm quite insecure and never sing and I know my boyfriend would love it if I came out my shell more in that way although he's always telling me how perfect I am It kept going through my mind that he should be with someone like that...fast forward a few days I'm still feeling VERY on edge and feel incredibly anxious when my boyfriend isn't really showing me that much affection or is in his room for long periods of time... I get very panicky and can't seem to calm myself until I go upstairs to see what he's up to if he's just sat there on his phone with his door shut I assume that he's not wanting to be with me even though I think having our own space is healthy and have never had an issue with it before after seeing him just sat there I'll get incredibly upset and more anxious and feel very emotional may even start crying and it's difficult to stop I suddenly view my boyfriend very differently?I'll also mention now that I was never like this at any other point of our relationship I just started feeling this intense anxiety since new years also I'll mention that I'm a very sensitive person and feel as though I pick up on other peoples emotions very easily and that I do that a lot with my boyfriend if he is feeling down about himself etc I also feel these emotions.As the days went on I stopped getting these anxious feelings when he wasn't always around but still felt bad anxiety and feeling depression creeping in as the days progressed I noticed myself becoming more sensitive to things and even hyperaware? think that's the word which would cause more anxiety for me my boyfriend may say something and I would take it in a negative way and feel offended by it and it would cause a lot of hurt and then anxiety is even worse... I would have a lot of moments of just emotional outbursts of crying and finding it difficult to stop just feeling very overwhelmed and so uncomfortable in how i'm feeling even gagging from what felt like stress and not being able to eat I'm feeling this pretty much everydaythe past month and a bit I've been having internal thoughts such as I don't love you and other horrible things directed at my boyfriend which cause me so much anxiety and even more stress as I try to convince myself they are just thoughts and not real having suddenly no feelings towards him? getting irritated at little things but still feeling intensely sad over the thought of him with someone else this person is perfect in my eyes and I love all the things about them that are considered imperfections where have my feelings gone? It's been over a month and I'm scared they won't return because I know this relationship when I'm not feeling this way is so good for me and has been the best thing for my life.I'll quickly mention that I'm 23 now and had a relationship when I was 14 that brought a lot of the very same feelings up but this happened very early on in the relationship a month or so with much breaking up and getting back together due to my anxiety and depression.I'm sorry for the essay but it's really hard to fit everything in but this is just the summary of it...Please can I get real responses with this I really want to make this relationship work and stop this anxiety and emotional stress and be able to feel these feelings again for my partner... I'd hate to think that it's over now.,Anxiety

52594,How do I accept the fact that my partner finds other women attractive? I have been feeling super anxious and insecure recently about the fact that my partner acknowledges that he has celebrity crushes or finds other women in our life good looking. I don't mean he's asking these people out or he's making moves I just mean on a surface level. My partner mentions often enough that he thinks a girl is good looking or that he finds this celebrity attractive. It really makes me anxious and insecure so I have a hard time hearing this. I know he doesn't mean anything by it but it's really upsetting me and making me feel so worried all the time that he is going to leave me. Is it normal for guys to do this? Is it normal for people to feel attraction to other people while they're in relationships? I certainly think other men are attractive I won't lie. But I definitely do not think about making a move on them or even flirting. I know the same is true for my partner I'm just having a hard time coping,Anxiety

I had a weird feeling rush through my body and then realized I had already come to a complete stop my vehicle wasn't moving and I was parked normally at a fair distance from the vehicle behind me. The moment felt like a long time but I believe it was only for a second.I consider myself to be a good driver with a clean driving record.

52610,I F24 don't believe my boyfriend M24 loves me and it's a me problem I have been struggling with worse anxiety for the past year and recently my anxiety does NOT let me believe that my boyfriend loves me. He gives me reassurance everytime I ask but for some reason it is never enough. For instance when he says why he does my thoughts will find complaints with his reasons why. I haven't talked to him about this because this is technically not a his issue and I hate burdening others with my anxiety. He has reassured me everyday and I don't want to ask for more. I feel like this is something I need to figure out on my own. I've had bad experiences with boys in general so I often time believe that they will say whatever is convenient to them. so I cannot shake this feeling and I do not know what to do. Ive been talking to a therapist but she has not been giving me effective solutions. She listens and validates but I need calming techniques... How do I shake this feeling? what should i do?,Anxiety
52611,It's been a while but it's back 20M i've been busy with life in a good way for the past 2 months going to the gym 5 times a week and eating healthy starting to like myself again. However out of nowhere it's back the feeling that I'm not doing things i should be doing feeling like the future isn't as bright as i hoped. And I don't know what to do.I've never spoken to anyone about my anxiety except my friend who is studying in a different country now. I don't know who i can speak to because in my head my problems seem like they're not big enough for me to talk about but yet they have a weird weight on my chest that makes it harder to breath,Anxiety
52612,How do you manage anxiety when sleep deprived? I am eating some good I haven't eaten for hours. I had a headache ive gotten like 2 hours sleep the past couple of nights.

52613,Anxiety? Im trying to figure out and address an issue Ive had my entire life or at least as long as I can remember. As I try to seek out treatment and help Im not sure if anyone here can relate.I will obsess and fixate on completely mundane things. For example If I overhear someone taking about a movie but I dont know what the movie is I may fixate on Who did they say the lead was? An Australian named Ben. What was the movie? What was the movie??? and my heart will start racing and my breathing will get shallow and Ill need to get up and walk around. Another example might be for me to see a photo of myself reading and Ill obsess wanting to figure out what the title of the book is that Im reading. I might also obsess wondering what a logo on a shirt is who was that guy that I helped with a flat tire that seemed so familiar etc. You know how sometimes people will hear a song and not know what it is and theyll say What IS that song? Its going to drive me nuts? For me it feels like that going to drive me nuts thing is for real. These attacks might also occur in certain circumstances of guilt or selfloathing. Does this sound at all relatable? Does it have a name?,Anxiety

52615,Any tips for dealing with these symptoms? Does anyone experience visionauditory issues? Recently this is whats been bothering me the most. The only way I can explain it is..imagine youre indoors for a long period of time and then come outside..its almost like Im sensitive to light and everything and I mean everything feels so loud. Ugh. I hate it. This past weekend I went to have lunch with a friend and the restaurant we ate at was so packed. I felt like I couldnt concentrate and my vision became shaky like i couldnt focus my eyes on one thing which eventually made me feel dizzy. Anyway I appreciate any tips if you have any. Thanks!,Anxiety
52616,Exposure Fail One of my exposure tasks is to walk my dogs outside. I had been incrementally increasing the distance i walked them up until today.I felt confident about todays walk before i left the house.

Its completely knocked my confidence.Thanks guys,Anxiety
52617,I dont know how to behave in group chats and its destroying me mentally. So to start off I dont have many friends and I dont participate in many discords so I admit Im a little out of practice here. But recently my three cousins decided we should all be part of a group chat and rekindle the bond we had as kids. I was all for it theyre family and I love em but just existing in this group chat is giving me some major anxieties. It also doesnt help that I have absolutely nothing in common with any of them. All they talk about is work their sos and gossip. They said we would be sending each other memes but every meme theyve sent so far have been the most unfunny monotonous tiktok reaction videos Ive ever seen. I dont even know how to respond to them so so far I just havent. Now after about 3 days the group chat is silent and I feel like theyve silently moved on. I just know its going back to the usual where I only ever talk to them at family gatherings which is another awkward thing Im going to stress about. I really am at a loss of how to handle myself and I fear that if I eventually get into a group chat of other friend groups itll go the same way. Ive tried joining discords before of varying sizes in the past but nowadays everyone types so fast and gets their thoughts out in seconds. I feel like by the time my brain is even able to process what was said and think of a response theyve already changed topics. Has anyone else here had to deal with this kind of thing before?,Anxiety

Just maybe two or three other mates I've met before but no one else. I don't have a plus one or anyone to go with.I'm feeling a bit anxious about it and don't want to be a bad friend or let him down by saying no but I have a feeling that if I go I'll feel really awkward.

52620,Ive recently been having problems with heart palpitations and increased anxious feelings Hi Reddit.

Ive grown up around anxious people having parents and step parents on anti depressants and with ptsd so I know how the gist of mental health issues in this caliber somewhat haha!.

I have so many ambitions with all these things I want to write. I might even publish them. I spend a lot of timeeffort on these studies I do on my personal life.The weird thing is whenever I go into focused studying the idea that I will die anyways comes to my mind. I start to feel like this effort is for nothing that I will die eventually maybe even soon. I read about these scholars of the past and see that some of them died so young. What will all this information help me with if I am going to die anyways? Will I have enough time to categorizeinterpretpublish so much knowledge?Anyways lots of anxious thoughts suddenly rush to my mind about mortality. I had this back in uni as well. I remember when I studied a lot during my masters I would always start thinking about my mortality and whether all the work I do is even worth it....Is there a scientific explanation to this? Why would studying in a focused manner put me in such an existential crisis each time?ampx200Bnote I use escitalopram for GADPanic,Anxiety

52636,Psychiatrist or psychologist? F22 TW self harm suicideHey there! I hope this is the right place to post about this. I don't know anyone irl who deals with so much anxiety so here we go.Since last summer I've been dealing with a lot of intrusiveobsessive thoughts about my relationshipmy partnerme etc which caused a lot of anxiety. From july all the way through december I felt like I was going crazy. I felt so much anxiety and so much emotional pain to the point where I thought I couldn't function properly. I would've done anything to stop feeling anything at all. And everything between me and my partner was fine I didn't have any reason to feel like this.In january I started to feel a bit better anxiety wise but I started to self harm again I don't do this constantly only once or twice every few months I guess. In january and february I felt so sad and so numb that I didn't care about anything anymore. I think I also experience suicidal thoughts but I am very afraid to die so idk if I actually do experience them. I still feel a little bit anxious and I do experience self harm thoughts here and there but overall I can function decently. I've never been to a psychiatrist or psychologist and so idk where I should start. The thing is therapy is very expensive and I can't afford it right now. I could afford going to a psychiatrist tho but i don't know if my situation is that bad in order to reach out to a psychiatrist. I am scared they won't take me seriously and that they will tell me to go to therapy instead.Do you have any advice regarding my situation? Any response would be much appreciated.,Anxiety

That dream did help me start to slowly get over my fear of it though. But I feel like if I stop worrying then itll happen i know when I finally get distracted I start to think huh maybe Ill be okay i dont feel like anything bad would happen and then sudden fear and feeling of it going to happen. Fucking lord go away. I just need to be okay for 13 more days and then I can see my therapist but my mind doesnt think ill make it in these 13 days. Like its certain Im going to die and if that doesnt happen then something else bad will especially if I stop worrying argh,Anxiety

52641,How to get over anxietyfight or flight when people are in my personal space all the time?? Hi everyone. I noticed my anxiety over the past couple months has gotten worse. I used to maintain decently w cbd here and there but I find that I'm getting frustrated or my fight or flight is seriously kicking inFor context just shopping in a store the other day. I'm reaching for a can of food and my bf is near me. Suddenly a middle aged man w a cart barrels through towards me and an employee is inches from me reaching for items directly below me. I suddenly moved so I wouldn't be touched or run over by this guy w the cart. No 'pardon me' 'excuse me' nothing.This morning I come to do my laundry at my local laundromat. I usually chat w a little old lady here but she usually gets in my personal space to clean literally crumbs from the floor.I am putting laundry in and I'm suddenly butttobutt with the laundry attendant a woman comes in w a body bag sized laundry bag and almost hits me w it and I try to back up and the laundry woman is directly behind me inches behind meI finished loading the laundry and went to my car for a deep breath. I called my bf to vent and he understands mostly how I feel. I also am starting to feel like an emotional burden to him.Idk how to cope anymore. I feel like I'm on edge all the time.Any tips would be amazing. I don't have health insurance so I can't be seen by a doctor anytime soonThanks for listening,Anxiety
52642,Why cant I just do things My bf is going out with some friends tonight and I was too scared to ask if I could come along. Normally I would but recently he said he wanted some space so it doesnt feel right asking him if I can tag along places anymore. Hell always say yes just to be nice. Then my friends call asking if we want to hang out with them and Im like bf is already going out. At this point I freak out. Urgent social interaction and I would have to ask bf for a ride. No I dont want to bother him. I feel stupid that I wanted to go out so bad. But when I was offered another chance to go out I declined because I was too scared of everything. I was too scared to ask to go with himI was to scared to ask for a ride I was too scared to go to an unplanned social eventTomorrow I have a planned social event and now I feel so insecure. It just feels like a cycle. Why cant I just do these things?EDIT next day and I found out he got a ride for once since hes always DD so I couldnt have asked for a ride anyway. If I had asked for a ride I think it would have been worse because he would have felt pressured to drive me which again would not be great since he asked for space a while back. I was feeling like the call was a sign to go out and I didnt. So I was feeling down on myself for choosing to miss out. But now that I know I probably could not have gotten a ride anyway somehow I feel better lmao Weird how that works isnt it,Anxiety

52652,Wedding speech in a few days social anxiety So Ive always had an aspect of social anxiety within me usually in groups of more than 3 or 4 people. One on one or in a group of 3 in absolutely fine.I had some bad experiences of speeches and presentations back in high school and totally avoided it throughout my adult life.Im now 31 and the only public speaking if you can calll it that Ive done is a hand full of interviews to no more than 3 people. Im my brothers best man at his wedding in a few days and Ive got to do it in front of 100 or so people which seems absolutely alien to me. My heart races and I get sweaty palms just thinking about it or practicing in front of a mirror. I hate the sound of my own voice and it just begins to breakshake and I go bright red and my mouth makes this involuntary frowning thing like Im about to cry whenever Ive had to do it in the past. Ive read online countless tips and advice but I just dont feel these people have it half as bad as I do? Ive resorted to getting a low dose of diazepam from my doctor only 6 2mg tablets and they have told me to take a maximum of 3 of theses before the speech. Will this honestly help? I appreciate the concerns about mixing alcohol and diazepam but I do believe that is a low dose and I only plan on having 1 or 2 small bottles of beer before the speech.Any tipsadvice? TIA.,Anxiety

52660,My health anxiety is spiralling I just got back from an eye check up for a new set of contact lenses and the optometrist told me my eyes are healthy and I just have a few eye freckles theyre on the whites of my eyes and are light grey. After the appointment KNOWING he said my eyes were fine I went into a rabbit hole and googled eye freckles and found out that in rare circumstances they can turn cancerous. I felt sick to my stomach and want to go back to an optometrist to get them removed but I know Im sending myself into a spiral. Its been about two hours now and Im starting to calm down about it all trying to tell myself that if anything was wrong I would be told. But I hate this. My brain has to focus on the worst outcome possible. Planning to speak to somebody about my healthy anxiety because I feel like its getting worse as time goes on. But it sucks.,Anxiety
52661,i need support please Hello I'm new to this community and I need your support. I am diagnosed with obsessive ocd disorder rocd severe depression and emotional addiction and a few hours ago i was in the middle of an ocd crisis and i came across something that triggered me as I was in full compulsion. It was about attachment styles can someone please tell me if i am a good person to love my partner and that an emotionally dependent person has the right to love someone and date them . I'm in such a healthy relationship and I'm proud of it because my previous relationship was very chaotic and so toxic and I'm afraid to be with him that because of my emotional dependency I want to be with him because i love it with all my heart but my thoughts are killing me i think it's the ocd side pressing where it hurts Thank you all. Be kind please my ocd makes me believe so many things through messages and it's horrible.,Anxiety
52662,Feeling dreadful after best friend didn't want me to come on night I know this feeling is unjust but I can't help but feeling dreadfully anxious and sad that my best friend didn't want me at a night on the Weekend. I'd been excluded before in this group of friends when they went on holiday last year together. I was really upset then and just so happened to be very down at that time anyway so I ended up bringing it up and we got into a huge fight where he said he hadn't meant to and these things just happened but also I needed to back off.So this weekend he said he'd got a ticket for this night but downplayed it like it was only him and another guy and not the whole group going. But everyone from that group went. He said he hadn't known they were but I'm sure that's not true and now on reflection they had probably planned it for months. I know I have no right feeling this way people can do what they want but I can't help but feeling really sad about it like he didn't want me there for a reason and after last time I don't want to mention anything because I don't think he'd take it well. I know we should be able to do different things and I'm not saying otherwise but I know everyone in this group and wonder why he didn't want me there. It's making me feel pretty low. We live together but I'm moving out next week and a part of me is worried he'll slowly cut me out of his life. How can I stop feeling like this? I feel pathetic,Anxiety

52666,Night time anxiety and noises from upstairs neighbor I rented downstair of a house for a really cheap price with my mom and brother. Upstairs is landlord and their family. Ive been living here for over four years. Everything is fine except when something is broken and I was afraid the landlord wont fix it or scared of landlord will sell the house and want us to move out. Anxiety hit real hardEarlier this year my neighbor upstairs landlords daughter brought home a high school graduated boyfriend. He is childish and usually yell out of nowhere. I have PTSD from domestic violence so this triggers me a lot. It seems like he knows Im scared so he brought it full blown one night last month by stomping laughing yelling while playing games at night. I try my best with school and hoping to graduate soon after next year to get the fuck out of here. But the panic attack happens every time there are noises at night and people upstairs are so passive aggressive that this is going no where,Anxiety

52668,Feeling as blue as the planet is warm TW CLIMATE CHANGEI am 22 yo and I've been studying to become a lawyer for the past 6 years.I'm on the verge of finishing my studies and I ask myself what's the point?How are we supposed to keep living as if things were normal as if Society was not rushing towards a brick wall?I've been worried about the environment for years especially feeling helpless and seeing governments and multinationals not giving a damn.In order not to be crushed with worry I held onto the idea that at worse our generation would be okay and it's the next one which would suffer the big consequences.In reality it's hard to be that optimistic especially as IPCC reports get more serious and worrying every time they're issued.The idea that Society is on the verge of collapse feels more realistic as time goes by. I'm scared that it will not be able to adapt to climate change that we will die or live in a postapocalyptic world.I'm scared and I feel helpless especially as a future lawyer because I don't see the use in lawyers in such a situation. I'm feeling depressed because I feel like my studies are pointless. I don't see how lawyers can be useful to save the world. I feel like it's too late for lawyers to be helpful in urgent times as law is such a slow process. I feel like what we need are people in the field scientists real politicians essential jobs etc.I feel useless and I feel really unmotivated to keep on working for my master's thesis.,Anxiety

52670,Thinking of deferring law school due to mental health and burn out. Really need advice and support Hey all For context Im 17F and in week 4 of 1L so have just started law school. However these past three years but specifically last year was so hard on me. On top of enormous pressure and performing at a ridiculous standard in high school to get into law my grandpa who had been battling with a brain tumour died 3 days before my first exam. These exams were the ones that dictated whether or not Id get into university. For some background my grandpa was like my father to me. When I was younger especially my dad wasnt home often as he was constantly working as a lawyer and would get home really late so I wouldnt see him. As a result my grandparents looked after me and I spent countless hours with them and still see my grandma every week. As you can imagine his death was possibly the most devastating thing for me. Seeing someone so articulate and intelligent being unable to move nor speak to you was so hard but I had to push it all aside and after burying him in the ground I went into school no literally 30 minutes after the burial I had to go to school for final exam prep. Anyways this was in November of 2022. I got through exams and for the first time in what felt like forever I felt happy at Christmas. My mind was clear I was surrounded by family and didnt have any responsibilities. I even managed to stop anti depressants for my anxiety which had been bad from 20202022 but especially ramped up in the period of his deaths to the point where I got through my days with whiskey and beta blockers. So I had a brief intermission of calm. I was happy for about 3 weeks till about February this year until it all came rushing back. Anxiety panic attacks derealization. Just like that put back on 10 mg of lexapro which Ive been on for just under 4 weeks. The trigger? Possibly University. Being back in an educational context with such high stakes and workload such as law may have caused this relapse. But I decided Id push through and have one to uni these past four weeks with the help of beta blockers. Its been probably one of the most difficult weeks since my grandpa died. Exhaustion unable to leave the house without terrible anxiety and just loss of ability to enjoy anything. Ive spoke to my therapist and he thinks I need a break from study and need some time to actually relax and process to allow my body o heal. Besides the mental strain Ive been under theres also been physical and health issues Ive been dealing with being hyperthyroidism and as of a week ago iron deficiency. Seems like my body wants me to stop but I dont want to. Studying gives me a sense of purpose of validation. I guess all I ask for is for some advice please. This is a big decision for me and I really just want someone to talk to and hear me. Thank you in advance ,Anxiety
52671,Since December I had a complete breakdown in December nearly a month to the day after writing my mom out of my life. I am mid 30s and my therapist said I have two ptsd triggers from childhood trauma with my mother being the largest chunk.The ER trip in December involved barking Help but feeling like I wasn't the one saying it and randomly losing consciousness due to hyperventilating and intense heart palpitations.The heart palpitations and hyperventilating happened about 7 years ago as well and I remember doing similar when I was a young kid.I had another panic attack last week and my anxiety has been up and down. Hydroxyzine for panic instances and prozac to keep me level.My mind instantly goes to the worst places when my anxiety is high it's a stroke a heart attack a tumor an uncurableunknown disease.Thanks to therapy I'm no longer depersonalizingderealizing but this just means that staying in the moment involves powering through intense heart palpitations fear and coldhot feelings.The medication brought back a handful of dreams for the first time in more than a decade or two but only for a week. But now I have had a handful of simple auditory hallucinations such as a drum beat a beeping sound or the sound of water pouring all of which are coming from in my head.Has anyone had a similar mental breakdown after removing someone like a parent? Work has been a stressor too but my mom was the trigger and work was the icing. For months before this I was frequently tired and not hungry at all and always stressed at work and had a short temper.I just want to feel normal. Right now things are generally ok but when that spiraling anxiety occurs it's really hard to break free and feel like I'm staying sane.,Anxiety

52673,Anxiety over appetite loss. Ive been feeling very flat like depressed lately along my anxiety like literally I can just cry and its hard for me to want to get out of bed. Ive been taking lexapro for a while and I believe it stopped working. New psychiatrist added 30 mg of mirtazapine with that. I felt like it was helping at first but now I dont feel it is. Im meeting with him next week. I feel hungry but I have no appetite I have to force myself to eat and thats giving me more anxiety because I have no appetite. Like nothing sounds good and when I start eating something nothing is sparking that oh this tastes good I want more and its giving me anxiety and scaring me. It also takes me forever to eat because of it like I mean forever I feel like Im just chewing and chewing when Im usually a fast eater so thats giving me anxiety. Im finding that the thought of eating because of that is giving me anxiety and Im scared that this isnt normal.,Anxiety
52674,Klonopin not working? Recently prescribed klonopin for general anxietysocial anxiety and panic disorder. Random facts about how my anxiety I dont frequently have panic attacks couple times a year but have pretty severe anxiety everyday from social anxiety to over thinking everything in my life to the point of ruining my day. Also experience nausea before any social settingevent no matter how small every single time. I also have car anxiety where I do not want to drive and am terrified when I ride with others. Been on SSRIS for years they never work. And when I say dont work I mean I couldnt tell you if I was taking a tik tac or my medicine I genuinely wouldnt know the difference. Been on lexapro buspar Wellbutrin and maybe a few others. My psychiatrist finally decided anxiety is the root not depression so I dont need a ssri. Im prescribed .5 a day half or the whole thing twice a day. Took half of .5 for the first month and tbh I didnt notice anything. Doctor told me maybe I need to take the full .5 twice a day so Ive been doing that and still dont feel like its doing much. Am I immune to medications lol??? I still have anxious thoughts and feelings Ill say though maybe the feeling of nausea before social settings has gone away but other than that I feel like my anxiety is still very present Side note very very far fetched side note a thought that Ive had is maybe just maybe ADHD is causing my anxiety? And this is why these medications arent working? Ive read adhd can cause anxiety disorders. Ugh I just want to know what the hell is wrong with me and how to fix it.,Anxiety

52676,MRI anxiety what does Diazepam do to you? If you have taken diazepam for one thing not long term can you please describe what happens? I dont like not knowing it is making me more anxious. Like will I feel trippy or sleepy or dopey? I have to have an MRI done on my head. First time I went I had a panic attack but got through it after 5 minutes and they didnt put headphones on my head under the coil its like a head cage which made me feel less trapped. I had to have a second MRI last month and I started crying as soon as I saw the machine then when it came to having the coil and headphones on I had another panic attack. The first time I was on my own and didnt properly recall that the headphones were a problem. I couldnt do the second MRI. Im going in to try again this Thursday and my GP prescribed me Diazepam. He didnt really tell me what it will do to me in detail just said it will make me less anxious.Edit I had the MRI! I made it through I am genuinely so proud of myself. I thought Id share the experience in case anyone has a similar question and ends up here. Took one 5mg tablet an hour before the scan. Im about 5 minutes I started feeling tired like Id got up way too early or stayed up too late. 45 minutes later I was feeling really tired and a bit zoned like Id had alcohol drunk without the sick feeling. I got to the appointment and was a bit slow answering questions mental lag sort of thing. Then in the machine I didnt panic I did feel the start of panic but it was very easily tampered down like it was just a thought. The mri went well got home and went sleep for 3 hours woke up tired still and a little bit sick and then have slowly woken up more through the day. Thank you for all the comments it really helped my nerves.,Anxiety
52677,Long term Clonazapam?? Long term Klonopin??I am a 20 yo male with fairly bad anxiety. Have tried every ssri in the book none of them work and give me horrible side effects. My anxiety is as follows completely random attacks feel like Im dying I went to the er many times. I cant process thoughts in my head pretty much 247 hard time holding conversation. I will sometimes have attacks with stressful situations at work but I have an important job so I dont let those attacks stop home from doing my job even tho it can be miserable. I have tried many different ssri hydroxzyine which works sometimes. The only thing that has worked is Xanax. Im prescribed 1mg but I typically break it up and take .25.5 as needed. The only thing I havent tried is a beta blocker which I will try next.Xanax allows me to have a perfectly clear head. I dont feel like a retard and trip over my words and feel disassociated when I am on it. I dont feel sedated or tired I just feel normal. It curbs and prevents panic attacks for usually 610 hours. I have been taking it more than I should recently .25.5 every day to every other day. I do notice some rebound anxiety on the days off but nothing too crazy.If a beta blocker doesnt work I will try clonazapam. I really dont care about dementia later in life. So my question is if these drugs increase my quality of life dramatically should I really avoid them just because of withdrawls? Yes I know their hell but you dont go through them if you are on em for long term with no intention of getting off.Sorry for the essay pls share input advice and experienceThanks,Anxiety

52681,Breaking up with boyfriend of two years because of my anxiety I 25f have been dating my boyfriend 33m for two years now. We havent really had any problems until my anxiety started worsening about 4 months ago. Ive had anxiety and depression since middle school and was officially diagnosed with ADHD in January. My anxiety and depression have been at a low for a few years now which I definitely took for granted. Im on a couple different antidepressants and got them to a good level. About 4 months ago my anxiety started worsening for no discernible reason. Okay great Im working with my therapist on it and talking to my psychiatrist about it but my overall mental health is still going downhill. My boyfriend luckily for him has never struggled with mental health and has no idea how to relate to me or support me. Ive been working really hard to communicate with him about how Im feeling and what I need but he really just ignores it. For example in January we were out of the country for my work and planned on staying a couple extra nights to make a vacation out of it. Traveling generally heightens my anxiety especially international travel. A lot of little things happened including a couple small actions he made one day that led to an anxiety attack and he basically ignored the fact that it was happening. A couple hours after I came down from the attack and I had taken a cold shower and eaten a little bit I talked to him about it a bit. I said you can correct me if Im wrong but it seems like you dont know how to respond or support me when Im having really bad anxiety moments like this he said yeah thats true so I asked if it would be helpful if I told him a couple things that help when Im really struggling. He agreed so I said a few things like getting me some cold water giving me a hugholding me taking a walk with me if thats an available option things like that. He said he could work with that. Over the past two or so months since then Ive had a few anxiety attacks similar to the one I had in January and every time he basically ignores my anxiety. Ive repeated my request a couple times but it doesnt make any difference. There are a lot of other similar issues that have been going on as well. Over the weekend we had a very short conversation probably 5 minutes max and half of it was silence because neither of us knew what to say. None of this is necessarily in order I really dont remember the order because it was really emotionally charged and kind of upsetting. I said I wanted to try to make it work. I asked him if he wanted to try to make it work and his response was I want you to be happy and I dont want to be taking that from you whether its because Im not putting the effort in or unable to support you or something else. Which didnt actually answer my question I guess it did in a roundabout way though. I also asked if he still loved me and he paused for what felt like forever before saying yes. Ive spent more time crying in the past two weeks than I have my entire life before this. Ive been thinking about our relationship a lot over the past couple months. Hes not a very talkative person in general. If theres an issue he ignores it completely or makes passive remarks and doesnt actually bring it up. I feel like not only am I the only one that tries to open communication lines but that Im not getting my needs met also. Ive talked to my therapist about it a bunch and I think Ive pretty much made my decision Im going to break up with him and work on my mental health. It feels terrible sitting on this knowing the relationship is coming to an end. I have some major events coming up at work this week including a 4 day long audit that Im in charge of so Im basically trying to balance holding off for as long as possible I.e. the end of the week and being anxious and miserable about it and having that hard conversation now and being a different kind of upset and not able to focus at work. Either way Im not going to be able to be completely mentally present at work Im just trying to figure out what would be best for me and also respectful to my partner. Im struggling with feeling like Im broken and impossible to love because of my anxiety. I know thats not actually the case but it sure feels that way. Anyway thank you for listening. All my family lives out of state and I only have a couple friends none of which I really talk about deep stuff like this with. I just want a hug. I apologize for the long post I just wanted to get it off my chest.,Anxiety
52682,Hearthealth anxiety Hi all 30mNew YorkThis post is about my struggle with health anxiety and the fear that my heart is failing. Might be a long one but would love to speak to anyone who hasis going through anything similar. I have had anxiety for years but have been able to deal with it until recently. 4 months ago I had some chest pain which caused a massive panic attack. The only way I can explain the sensation is that it felt like someone was grabbing my heart and squeezing. A couple of days later I went to my doctor and had all the necessary tests. Blood work EKG echo etc. All results came back fine as expected except for the fact that I have an oddly low pulse 53 most of the time and the chest tightness remained. Over the next few months my panic attacks became less frequent twice a week and my chest tightness began to disappear.I managed this by reminding myself throughout the day of any moment where I was distracted enough to feel normal. An hour or two went by and I would be suddenly be reminded that Im not dying. I feel great. It must all be in my head. I had also started weekly therapy during this time but I didnt find it particularly helpful. My therapist mostly talked for an hour and guided me through breathing exercises. I think what I really wanted was to find the route of the problem.More recently my panic attacks have been worse and more frequent. I have been feeling heart palpitations a lot or more accurately my heart skipping beats.I began checking my pulse and counting the beats fairly often at this point causing more anxiety and more panic attacks. Now Im obsessed with my low pulse and my blood pressure machine. Almost all results show high blood pressure with a pulse of 51.I have just had a heart monitor on my chest for 48 hours and wont get the results back for another 10 days or so. And this is where I am atFrequent panic attacks and the constant thought that my high blood pressure and low pulse will either kill me give me a stroke or make me faint.Anyone else gone through this? Thanks!,Anxiety

52689,Can someone please understand me and give me motivation! Hello everyone I hope youre okay!So from January 24th up to know I have fallen back into my anxious state. It all started when I went to the big city in January I hadnt felt anxious in months and I love the city so didnt expect it. When I was walking off my train all the way down to the shopping centre I felt my legs and they didnt feel normal not weak but not strong and I was really aware of them and felt like my legs would just fail to walk and Id fall over. The more I walked the more I started to stress out it got to the point where I felt dizzy and a bit lightheaded cause I was panicking and BOOM it hit Im think OMG am I going to pass out ! I started to panic and think maybe it was diabetes but Im a slim 22 year old male with no health conditions but in the moment I was panicking it was horrible so derealised and the fear of impending doom ! And then 3 days later I imagine because my nervous system was stimulated I was at my grans putting her bins out and for no apparent reason 0100mph panic attack my legs instantly out of nowhere felt weak ish and shaky and so didnt my arms and I let out this big exhale and I felt off balance and kind of dizzy in my head I rushed out the house into the car and sat there for a minute and I was okay but walking from my car to the house again made it happen mildly. Fast forward to today 20th of June i am still struggling with anxiety. Not the instant panic attack weak legs. This is like a head pressure feeling kinda like Im tilting my head. Anyway I get this when I go on walk and panic and think Im gonna pass out or fall over and then I think its something serious. I am also getting. It in shops. Although I have been in 4 shops the past few days just to ivercome this feeling. The past two times I had it very mild but made it without a panic attack and rushing out. B it because of this and headaches I want to say all my symptoms dont hurt and they arent terrible they are 310 maybe 4.510 when panicking in terms of intensity but i still panic thinking Im gonna fall to the ground or pass out. HOW DO I GET OVER THIS because Im currently thinking I have a brain tumour. Basically all I want is reassurance that its anxiety and its not high blood pressure had blood pressure check at doctors this year after walking there and it was fine diabetes I had general blood tests before and I didnt have diabetes I am also a slim male 22 brain tumour head pressure and headaches making me think. Fairly certain I had similar dizziness years back when my anxiety was at my peak and my doctor kept telling me no brain tumour about 3 years ago. Also Im scared of having low iron but I guess I just eat more iron and Ill be okay ? Please let me know what you think. I have had 6 heart tests from three years ago up until now and its fine!Thank you in advanceI am also starting to feel my heart rate again to check it and its stressing me out and making me more aware of it!Also need to mention I play computer games for like 4 hours a day and not that far from my monitor lol. Could be this ? I am also on my phone a lot,Anxiety

Ive watched my mother struggle mentally with it too. I also still live with my father and cant afford to move out at the time. We had an episode tonight and he charged after me and my mom had to get involved. I was already having horrible anxiety and this has increased tenfold. I feel that my heart will give out. I dont want to live the rest of my life like this. Ive already made so many mistakes and I can barely hold down a job. Is there anything I can do to deal with this unbearable anxiety 247?

However lately my dreams has been really bad its always about worst case scenarios where I lose this girl I have been talking to and I feel like Im developing my feelings towards.

52694,Anyone else anxiety symptoms run like clockwork at specific times of the day? I think my GAD is so severe it now has a physiological source where my brain chemistry is messed up. My cortisol or serotonin levels throughout the day decide how I feel. DAE see patterns in their anxiety symptoms like this? Mornings Wake up feeling shaky and short of breath takes 30min of scrolling on my phone to get the motivation to get up. Afternoon Tension builds up and I feel stiff and uncomfortable for no reason. Or have an adrenaline dump around this timeEarly Evening Can be 5050. Either I feel fine or symptoms start up again and last for a bitLate evening Right at around 11pm or so some chemical switch goes off in my body and 80 of my issues vanish. It gets easier to breathe my Heart slows down and my brain fog lifts. Start feeling much happier too and its very obvious the constant subconscious anxiety has lifted. I have always been a night owl and even before my panic disorder I had weird spurts of energy and motivation in the late evening which made me a productivity machine in the AM. Sleep I can sleep relatively ok but if something startles me and wakes me up I have a full on panic attack. I get at least 7h of sleep daily. ampx200BI wonder if medication can help fix this. Any experiences?,Anxiety

52702,Im 29M having bad anxiety in new relationship I 29M started dating my girlfriend 24F around 3 months ago. Almost a month ago we became officially boyfriendgirlfriend and since then my anxiety has skyrocketed. At the start I used to be pretty confident always trusted her etc but now Im struggling. She has given me 0 reason not to trust her but Im always thinking worst case scenario. She is on her phone? Probably talking to another guy. She goes out with her friends? Probably cheating on me. Yesterday we were together in bed and I saw she was looking at some photos on her phone and could see on the photo reel some pictures I didnt recognize. The background was red and that was everything I could actually see I was without glasses. I immediately started thinking that those pictures are probably with a random guy and that she is cheating on me. I mean even if they were photos with someone else which I dont even know if they were photos of herscreenshots a random thing etc she can have photos with friends without me thinking this. I know this is not healthy and while I havent showed her my anxiety Im sure at some point I will mess up and she will probably start distancing herself. I mean this reeks controlling behavior right? I even had some issues with my bank that I thought she caused not at all. This is my second relationship my first was not great but my ex never cheated or anything so Im not sure what is causing this. Could it he that Im insecure? Or just dont want to lose her? My gf is awesome and I really enjoy our relationship so far. She is attentive shows interest always makes time for us cooks for me etc. I feel loved.It is worth noting that I almost screw everything up at the beginning as I broke up with her before we were oficial for another girl. I realized my mistake shortly after and she accepted me back after apologizing and having a deep conversation with her. Im constantly thinking that I dont deserver her after that and that if I were her who knows if I would have taken me back. Could this be part of it?TLDR I 29M started dating my gf 24F over 3 months ago. She has given me 0 reason to not trust her but Im constantly anxious thinking the worst that she is talking with other people cheating on me etc. This makes me fear I will eventually become very controlling. How can I address this?,Anxiety
52703,just realized my carbon monoxide detector is expired and im freaking out ever since i was maybe 1011 ive had an irrational fear of carbon monoxide poisoning. its gotten better now that im older but it used to be so bad to the point where i would refuse to sleep some nights because i was convinced that i would die in my sleep from carbon monoxide poisoning and that i wouldnt be able to hear the alarm going off if there ever was a leak.i currently have one CO detector in my house a battery operated one and its in my living room. i recently read somewhere that CO detectors at least the first alert ones which is the kind i have are only effective for about 57 years. i unplugged mine and checked the back and saw that the date of manufacture was march 2nd 2016 which was almost exactly 7 years ago. although the alarm hasnt given the end of life warning yet. i even tested it to see if it was still working and it was although there was no green or red light. dont know if that means its not receiving power or what or if thats normal. its currently 11pm so i cant really go out and buy another CO detector right now. im just scared that there will be a leak or something tonight and that my detector wont go off and i'll die in my sleep along with my pets. i know its extremely unlikely that there will be a CO leak tonight but i cant help but think about it. i'll probably buy another detector tomorrow if im able to. im terrified right now. i feel like this is such a stupid thing to be afraid of and im not really sure why ive been afraid of it for so long. any reassurance would be very much appreciated.i hope i'll be able to get some sleep tonight.,Anxiety

52705,Im going on anxiety detox I want to cut caffeine and sugar intake and start meditating everyday 10 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes at nightafter 10 days Ill start meditating 40 minutes a day Ill also add running 5 kmsI want to report how I feel during this project and Ill try to understand if my anxiety really goes away.thankuu for all the support its really cuteDay 130 20.03 Overall this day was easy for me I didnt experience any headaches from my new nosugarnocaffeine diet my mind felt more a bit less stressed than yesterday though I slept 6 hours at nightI accidentally ate one sweet oopsiesBut I had a public speech and my body responded with a fight or flight response Public speaking is one of those things that I want to master by dealing with my anxiety issuesDay 230 21.03 Lmaoo today I did feel those headaches after cutting caffeine. They were not so strong though. I definitely feel less anxiety but not so much. My legs almost died when I was running and my sneakers are dirty afthe weather conditions in my city are Anyway I did well. I took a test so I can track my anxiety. I got 1138 score it was a social anxiety test because sometimes I start worrying when I talk with peopleThe test results say that my anxiety level is considered as low and thats true but I want to feel 100 confident around any person and in any situation. Public speaking still awakens in me fear of being judged so its still a big way to go.Day 330 22.03 It was really hard to get up from bed and I dont know why maybe because of cutting sugar. Meditated twice in the morning because yesterday I accidentally fell asleep while wanting to take a nap Omg my legs hurt so much when I runToday I feel more stable than before this project and even yesterday as if my inner psychological core or something has grown stronger I stopped worrying about little things that always bothered me before this challenge. For example I stopped hesitating to talk to handsome guysDay 430 23.03 I probably wont run today my legs are sore. I stopped having mood swingsFeel much more relaxed than ever before. Things really bother me much less. I just stopped thinking random negative thoughts. My hands used to shake from stress sometimes now it doesnt happen.upd no it still doesI had little eczema caused by my nervousness on the back of my hand now its completely gone. Headaches dont bother me I dont crave sweets but I started to eat much more.Day 530 24.03 I feel really goodI started to understand my anxious thoughts and emotions and realised how I used to repress them their symptoms rapid heartbeat trembling hands. Its funny how theyre going away now when I noticed my resistance towards them. Like I used to get annoyed and try to control my body when my hands started shaking or tried to calm down my heart when I get worried now I just let go of control. Today I also didnt run instead I walked 6kms on a high speed. I dont mean to ruin the challenge it just seems like I injured my legs.Day 630 25.03,Anxiety

52708,DAE have an element of narcissism with their anxietyOCD IE My anxiety is the worst and no one else's anxiety is like mine or can relate to me? I have been a sufferer of GAD and pure O OCD for years possibly my whole life. One interesting aspect of my own anxiety is that I have developed a sort pride in my anxiety in the fact that I think it's so bad that no one else could possibly even relate or even be close to mine. I have identified and hypothesized that this is really a form or manifestation of narcissism and possibly a coping mechanism. Throughout my journey of anxiety my brain has tried to deal with the helplessness of anxiety by trying to twist my crippling anxiety into a form of grandiosity delusional which I am hypothesizing is the narcissism aspect.,Anxiety
52709,How to deal with anxiety caused by new in site job? I had pretty bad problems with anxiety a couple of years ago but I managed to get better. For the last couple of years I worked remotely my job was calm and my colleagues were nice. Two weeks ago I started a new office job. At first felt just drained mentally and physically and I thought that this was just me adjusting to my new lifestyle but now I feel how my anxiety is back. Being locked in a small room the whole day surrounded by people that I don't know has taken a tow on my mental health. And this in only 2 weeks!I have the option to work someday of the week remotely but I was hoping to be in the office until I get a grasp of what are my daytoday tasks.So do you have any advice on how I can deal with this for at least a couple more weeks until I feel comfortable getting an home office day?,Anxiety

52711,Anxiety spiking after starting fluoxetine Prozac Hello all! Im new here. I recently decided to take a break from a problematic drinking habit and found that I had been self medicating for anxiety more than I realized as it sprang back with a fury. I decided to go back on ssris fluoxetine generic Prozac specifically. I figured it would help me with the depression and anxiety as my brain healed. Ive been abstinent from alcohol for 82 days now. The first few days of fluoxetine were amazing but then mid last week I started feeling really really anxious. Like unprovoked where are these waves of intense anxiety coming from? anxiety.Ive been on anti depressants in the past so Im no stranger to their effects but I dont remember having this negative of a reaction. Ive been trying every coping mechanism I know. I have a very supportive family and am seeing a therapist so Ill get through this. Its just extremely uncomfortable. Did I mention that Im a middle school music teacher? Its really hard to stand up in front of a room of adolescents and conduct a rehearsal when you are in full fight or flight mode. Anyone else have this experience? I read several posts on here from people saying that the ssris fixed the depression but not the anxiety. I am hoping for more positive results in the long run. Have a great one!,Anxiety

52716,Did I have a panic attack? About a month ago I F 25 had what I think was a panic attack. Ive gone through childhood physical and emotional abuse and traumatic events in adult hood family member has tired to take their life a few times but I have resisted the idea of getting professional help for myself since I was 1112 and have only opened up about 90 with my long term boyfriend.In 2017 I was at an all time low and was feeling like life wasnt worth it and felt numb to the world. One night after going for dinner with work friends I was walking home and collapsed on the ground. I was conscious but felt so numb my body and mind just gave up there and then. Some people came to help me and called an ambulance for me. When the paramedics arrived the shook me and got me on a bed I didnt talk but could hear them. I suddenly snapped out of it when they rolled me into the ambulance and started crying. The paramedic pricked me with a needle on my finger to test me for something. It hurt and was unexpected. They said they had to take me to the hospital to check me out but I was sure in my head that nothing was physically wrong with me. I got to the hospital and was so embarrassed and ashamed that I told staff I should leave and I went home. I was so incredibly embarrassed and ashamed and still am. How dare I just let all that happen when I wasnt an emergency and what if someone somewhere needed help and was dying. I just dont understand why didnt snap out of it. Fast forward to a month ago. I was at first aid training ironically and that machine that pricks your finger was brought out to show us. The instructor used it on his own hand. I remembered immediately what I had done in 2017 and all the feelings of shame guilt embarrassment came rushing back. I didnt think much of it and we moved onto what the readings of the blood would tell you. I suddenly started feeling my hands sweat and a hotness covered my hands and seemed to radiate throughout my whole body and face. I was taking notes and my hand became so weak I couldnt keep writing. Then I realised my hands were shaking uncontrollably. At this point I was thinking it was in my head but then my heart started racing sooo incredibly fast. I was still sure it was in my head as all I could think about was that Im not someone who faints at the sight of blood. Then I started feeling like I was going to faint and to my embarrassment I had to stick my hand up and say infront of the class I was not feeling well. I got up and staggered outside the room and sat on a chair. The instructor followed me clearly concerned. I then started thinking I was having a heart attack and was about to die. I genuinely started thinking what is everyone going to think if I die right here my boyfriend my family. I was telling the instructor that I dont normally faint and that I felt weird and that my pulse was fast. The instructor took my pulse and told me to slow my breathing hadnt even noticed how fast and heavy I was breathing. Soon as he told me that I started calming down and thought if hes not worried about me dying then maybe Im not. I started feeling much better after that. At the end of the class he said he reckons it was a little bit of anxiety. Was that a panic attack? Whatever it was it scared me. Since then Ive had 6 more with varying degrees but the first was the worst. This has pushed me to tell my doctor I need to speak to someone as Im scared its going to happen in public and now Im being referred to therapy so Im not diagnosed with anything yet so am clueless. Sorry for the long post.,Anxiety

This has been extremely frustrating because my bf has this habit when he is anxious and not even realizing it and its causing my to have attacks and then I am zorped and on edge. And he is constantly on edge trying to look out for me. We are trying different things like closing doors and both trying to be mindful but I would really like help on how to manage and treat it.

52728,My anxiety is ruining my personal relationships Recently I got a fairly nice gift for a friend's birthday 40 worth which isn't an extravagant gift but definitely the nicest gift I've given in this particular friendgroup. I was really excited about this gift because I thought it was a good fit for this person. Unfortunately my excitement for giving this gift turned to anxiety as I became concerned about how such a relatively nice gift might be perceived being given to a friend of the opposite sex.... I REALIZE THIS IS COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL.... as most of my anxiety is.So this became a trigger for a multiweek bout of extremely high anxiety and this person definitely realized that they were the trigger for it one way or another......... and now it seems like they are at the point that they are starting to get a little freaked out and I'm afraid of losing one of my closest friends. I feel the need to apologize or explain..... for making them feel so horrible but how can you explain this. I'm afraid that talking to them about it will just make it more awkward. Our recent interactions have been cold and awkward. I don't know what to do now.,Anxiety

52730,Road Test anxiety I'm 21 years old and I don't have my liscence. I've taken the road test three times in the past year the last time I took it was on Thursday of last week. I bombed. Hard. I made sure I knew everything and what to do I'm decent for a new driver I know how to do a three point turn and my parallel parking is great I drive as much as possible with my mom and I made sure I was extremely prepared. However when I got in the car for the test I was panicking the whole time. I failed almost everything and everything in my brain got jumbled up. I'm not diagnosed with anxiety never seen a psychiatrist or been on meds or anything not how my family is but I am a deeply deeply anxious person I don't know how to get past this. My next test is in a couple weeks and I know I'm prepared and can drive and having my liscence would make my life so much easier but I'm so worried I'm never going to get it because of how anxious I get on the test. I just want to know if this is a shared experience and if anyone has any advice or anything. ,Anxiety

52735,School anxietylonger read 14M Last year my anxiety was minimal because of covid and not being in high school grade 8 I didnt go as much but this year having to go and pass was a lot worse and took a toll on me and my mental health causing a lot of anxiety and depression. The first semester was so bad and I remember thats when everything stopped feeling real and I got bad derealization. I remember in class when it got bad being convinced everyone was working for the government to track me down and control me. Later next semester it mellowed down still nothing feels real idk what real feels like or is anymore. The only major difference is my mind is foggy and I am not depressed anymore for some reason. I also get mind delusions I snap out of fast. But I recently started seeing shadow people and cars speeding towards me. I also started hearing very minimal voices almost in the halls calling my name saying just hey or even no if I was thinking something ig I didnt agree with. I cant get help my mom wouldnt approve does anyone have suggestions even on what can help all this.,Anxiety
52736,Just got prescribed Enlift Xanax as well as magnesium for my anxiety. Do you guys have any insight on what to expect? Personal experiences? Hello! After dreading going to a psychiatrist for a couple of months I finally got the courage to do it and this is a big step for me. The doctor prescribed me Enlift Xanax and Magnesium which I've heard good things about it in this subreddit. Ive only ever been prescribed Zoloft tried it for about 3 months and it didn't work for me so I'm basically going in blind. The doctor told me some basic instructions as well as explained how they work but it doesn't ease my anxiety about them especially Xanax. I generally get a lot of anxiety about medications tho not just this kind . I know medications like these aren't a onesizefitsall but I think it would ease my anxiety to know some of your guys personal experiences with them. I think knowing I'm not alone in this will make it less scary for me especially with the stigma in my country around any medication for mental health.edit looked up Enlift and it goes by a lot of other names but Google says it's scientific name is Escitalopram if that's of any help,Anxiety

52738,Questions for new anxiety sufferer... Does anybody's anxiety present with just the following symptomsChest TightnessTightness in the front of the neck and under the chinLightheadednessDizzinessFeeling FaintLike I may pass outNauseaThese are the symptoms I've been feeling. I don't really seem to have an impending sense of fear or doom when these things happen but I will say they are triggered by talking about my condition or just general stress but sometimes they happen for no reason at all. I have just been sitting watching TV playing a video game or scrolling through Reddit and they've happened.I've been to the ER three times at two different hospitals in the past week with these symptoms in addition to high blood pressure and all three times my blood work and ECG have been normal.I need to add a lot of these symptoms got worse when lying down and got better when sitting up or walking.In light of that last detail the ER doctors said it's just GERD and sent me home with orders for a PPI medication and a Blood Pressure medication.Well the GERD has improved and all the symptoms I've listed above have improved as well but haven't gone away.I'm seeing an anxiety doctor later this week and out of an abundance of caution a cardiologist later next month soonest they could get me inAnother detail I received a call from the doctor earlier telling me my cholesterol was high and my potassium was a little high from the Lisinopril BP med so they started me on a diuretic and a cholesterol medication. As soon as I got off the phone with that news I instantly started feeling the pressure in my neck and chest... This is what leads me to believe my symptoms are anxiety related.TLDR Asking about all of your symptoms to see if mine line up with anxiety or not.,Anxiety

Or like oh youre thinking about this thing and youre not anxious this should make you anxious.. then Im anxious and carry that anxiety with that thought in the future.Almost all of the time these thoughts are not based in reality also. I have a severe fear of the sky for example and suffer with agoraphobia I cant go on public transport alone either.

52746,Gaining my appetite back A few years back I decided to change my horrible diet and gain weight. I didnt realise if at the time but my diet was so bad. I once went a whole day with just eating a single yoghurt and hadnt realised how BAD that was. Well last yearor the year before? I made an effort to force myself to eat and increase my appetite. It worked. Ive gained weight and Im happy. Well I could be happier by gaining more weight but I have a fast metabolism so Im comfortable with my weight. Anyways last week I got a bug that has now lowered my appetite and Ive barely eaten anything since then. Ive now become suddenly conscious that my appetite has gone again and I need to train my stomach to eat more yet again. Its gonna take me a few days or a week but I know I can do it. Its just making me anxious at the moment because every time I eat I get full very quick just like I used to. So this next week may or may not be a pain while I get my appetite back up.,Anxiety

52750,Tingling in sideback of head Has anyone had head tinglingnumbness with anxiety? I spent the last 15 minutes freaking out because I woke up today feeling somewhat very anxious. A few minutes later I felt this crawlingtingling feeling that started from my left temple to the back of head. It comes and goes and boy.....the panic I felt with it was the icing on top of the cake. There's no pain whatsoever but just a weird sensation that makes me feel like the left side of my head is going numb.This is the first time it's happened to me. I have been somewhat anxious these past few days about my health so I'm not sure if that is the trigger? I don't have any headaches whatsoever. And I'm refraining from googling because I know whatever I'm reading is gonna aggravate my anxiety. But my brain has decided that it's best to jump to the worst case scenario I'm trying to keep calm because I know if I let my thoughts run loose it's going to make me feel worse.But I'm really wondering if it's the stressanxiety causing it.

52762,A month ago I was drugged without my consent long post... TLDR Dad gave me edible without my knowledgeconsent I had a really bad trip now I don't know how to deal with it.Hey not sure if this is the best place to post this. I'm not even sure what I'm looking for exactly to vent? To know if someone had a similar experience? I don't know.Last month I was staying at my dad's house. One night I was sitting in the living room while he and his wife were in the kitchen nearby. I wasn't paying any attention to them I was playing a video game on my dad's laptop. I had headphones on with one ear uncovered because I was also watching The Simpsons. So I didn't know what they were talking about.My dad came up to me and held out what seemed to be this gummy candy. I don't remember if I asked what it was whether I did or not he was just like Try it. Now the thing about my dad is that this sort of thing isn't unusual I'm used to him making me try weird foods and such. So perhaps foolishly I ate it without really questioning it it tasted vile. It was only after I had already swallowed it that he told me it was an edible.Now another thing about him is that a lot of times he likes to mess with me. Once when I was a teenager for example he gave me a drink and told me it had alcohol when it really didn't. So I wasn't sure if he was lying or not. I knew he and his wife sometimes took edibles I just...didn't know they had any at the time. I had never done drugs before and I don't think I would have eaten it if I had known.After that he and his wife went to bed. About an hour or so passed then it began kicking in. I started feeling dizzy and I got kind of scared so I went into their bedroom and I asked my dad if it really was an edible. He said No. This was a lie but obviously I didn't know it at the time.I decided the best thing to do was try to get some sleep. There was only one bedroom so I had been sleeping on a mattress in the corner. So I was lying there crying because I had no idea if what I was feeling was because I was high or if it was all in my head.My dad's wife was also high and she started talking to me. I started laughing things got kind of funny...I started talking about all of my interests much to my dad's annoyance as he was trying to sleep and I said some really embarrassing things I later found out he had recorded at least most of what I said...well yelled 'cause apparently when I'm high I get really loud. I have selective mutism so I tend to have a lot of trouble talking if I'm not really comfortable it's gotten better over the years but my dad is convinced that I don't actually have it or something...Anyway at some point I fell asleep and had a horrible nightmare. It's hard to describe but it involved me forgetting everything...my life my interests the people I knew and the world around me...I dreamt that my dad knew I was going to forget it all and I remember the fear I felt in the nightmare. Just that feeling of...Why? Why would he do this to me? I tried to recall faces mine my dad's a musician I have a crush on yeah weird I know...and everything was warped grotesque. Everything became a black void you know that scene in Spongebob where Squidward's in that Alone place? Kind of like that except black instead of white. I began thinking that maybe I had died or was dying and that this horrible void was the afterlife.I woke up sobbing and screaming Oh God!Oh Lord! over and over and also yelling at my dad How could you do this to me!? and I will never forgive you! He and his wife got me up from the mattress and had me drink some water. Everything during this part and afterwards felt like a dream that I was trying to wake up from.My dad made me some oatmeal and put on some songs by one of my favorite artists American Murder Song. In my disoriented state I remember thinking that the first song he put on was familiar and that if I could just hang on to that familiar feeling everything would hopefully be okay. I vaguely remember singing along to the songs.After I ate he put on one of my favorite movies Repo! The Genetic Opera and left me in the living room. I remember it being on but it felt almost like I was half asleep or something throughout. I was just anxious and confused and I was trying to focus on the movie but I kept...I don't know it was like going in and out of consciousness or something. There's a scene towards the end of the movie where the main character falls unconscious and I remember vaguely wondering if perhaps I was actually her I'm a guy not that it mattered to my drugged self and that I would wake up and the movie would be reality.Apparently I also sang along to the whole move but I don't remember this my dad came into the room to check on me at some point and he said I seemed to be having a great time but I know I really wasn't. I do remember however that at some point I threw up all over myself. After the movie I told my dad I threw up and he was mad that I was too disoriented to clean it up myself. By this point about six hours had passed since I had taken the edible. I remember being so confused I asked him what day it was. After that I went back to sleep.The next day my dad told me that it really was an edible...so I did feel somewhat relieved that it was actually a drug that was making me feel that way. But for about three days afterward I still felt the affects of it...and for about a week or so I kept experience derealization.My dad's reason for giving me the edible...he said he thought it would make me talk more...which it did but it was humiliating. Apparently he and his wife had talked about what was in it before he gave me the edible but as my cousin pointed out to me it's strange to just assume that I'd be paying attention to a conversation that I wasn't even part of even if I was in the room. So he apparently thought I knew what it was...I wasn't able to go home immediately he lives in another state so he had to buy a plane ticket and all that but when I eventually did I told my mom what happened. She's furious at my dad though neither of us have spoken to him about it. I talked to my therapist about it recently but her reaction seemed...dismissive like she thought it was cool that it made me talk about my interests but again...I had no consent.So here I am exactly a month after it happened...I still experience derealization if I think about it parts of the nightmare I mentioned I literally only remembered last night.... I just...I don't know how I'm going to get over this. I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to for example watch Repo! again...just recently I listened to one of the songs my dad had put on and it gave me a weird feeling in my stomach. I'm trying to decide whether or not to cut ties with my dad...this isn't the first time I've thought about it to be honest but I'm seriously considering it now. I just know now that thinking about that nightmare still terrifies me...,Anxiety

52768,I accidentally wore white to a wedding and can't stop shamespiraling Selfforgiveness with anxiety Yesterday I attended my boyfriend's cousin's wedding and wore a short creamcolored dress with a black pattern. The color literally did not occur to me when I got dressed. I picked it because I felt bloated and it was flowy and that's as far as my brain got.At the reception my boyfriend's mom spilled red wine on my dress. As I tried to dab out the stain I caught myself saying see this is why I never wear whiteand then it hit me. I spiraled into an anxiety attack and left the reception to go back to my hotel to change. I felt like such an asshole such an idiot and I still can't shake that feeling.I sat in the secondtolast row at the ceremony at the very end of the row away from the aisle thank God. It was a casual wedding. People were there in jeans. No one said anything to me. And it was genuinely an accident. A very stupid accident. But it was also my first time meeting my boyfriend's extended family and I'm now convinced they all hate me. I can't think about anything else. I feel like such a fuckup like I'm a bad person.Logically I know it's not the end of the world. I know if THAT was my biggest asshole move in recent memory I'm doing OK. But I don't FEEL any of that.

52775,I don't know what to do. I don't know how to do it. I don't know where I am. I don't know where I'm going. By tomorrow night I 21 yo UK university student have to email my dissertation supervisor a draft of what I have written so far the deadline is in May and he wants to give me some feedback before the upcoming Easter break. But the problem is that I haven't written anything. At all. I've collated dozens of pages of general notes vague ideas and research over the last few months but I don't have a clue what to do with it or where to start.I've written probably hundreds of assessments and essays in my life and until a few weeks ago I had not failed a single one of them. But a few weeks ago my motivation selfbelief and general ability to work which were all low to begin with anyway just stopped altogether. I had deadlines for two course module assessments within a week of each other and I missed both of them. For one of the first times in my education I had not only failed with work but I had failed to even complete the work. I missed the first one because I had zero interest in knowledge of or care for the subject because I kept procrastinating and because it's possible that I have ADHD I don't want to know about this but I think I have it. I missed the second one because of the same reasons and because I failed the first one so it didnt make a difference if I missed the second one.Since I got the email last week from my supervisor that I have to send him whatever I've been working on by tomorrow Tuesday I've not only not been working on the dissertation but I've detached myself from it almost completely. I dont like thinking about it. I keep distracting myself from it literally and mentally because I don't want to do it. The subject itself interests me it was my choice after all and ive done a lot of research too much I think and every time I ever doubt my work ability like this which is every time ive ever done an assessment in my three years at university it usually turns out alright but I can't see how this one of course the most important one will end in anything other than failure. So Ive come all this way from the start of uni three years ago from the start of reception 17 years ago and I've always at the very least managed to succeed. But now of all times is when it stops.Im aware that every student who has ever tried to write a university thesis has had these doubts at some time or a lot of the time. But that makes me feel all the more incapable. Because those students have all and will all get through it and I know that I won't. I look around the university library that I'm currently writing this in and all I see is people working theyre focused selfdisciplined and content to be here. But Im not one of them. I know that I dont belong here and I dont like it here. I really don't like coming here. But I come here nevertheless. I'm sitting here wasting more time on something that I don't have to do that I shouldn't be doing but I'm doing nevertheless. Because I think a part of me actually wants to fail. I don't know why anyone would want that especially me I've always feared failure the confirmation of it by my university and parents the consequences of it practically and emotionally and that's whats driven me to always succeed with my work in education. I've only ever done that work because I fear the consequences of not doing it. I do it because I have to never because I wanted to. I've always been like this.So why am I here then? If you never enjoyed school or college which i didn't then why did you actively decide to go to university? Hmm. Maybe because I thought I had to not because I wanted to pursue a career I have absolutely no ambition at all. And it was partly because the idea of getting a job after I left college at 18 seemed completely impossible I've suffered from social anxiety for most of my life the basics of social interaction are overwhelming to me. But mostly it was because I didn't think any of it through. I didn't want to think it through at all. My parents thought I could maybe go to this university so I just said okay. I didn't even look into the university at all and I didn't consider any others. The reason that I do this is because I hate thinking about the future short medium and long term. Whenever people ask me about the future whether its where do you see yourself in five years what do you want to do with your life or even simply do you have any plans for the weekend Ive always given vague nonanswers. I've been like this forever. Probably because Ive been bombarded with these questions from career advisors since Year 1. But it's also because the future is too uncertain and complicated. It scares me to think about the future in any sort of way. So I don't. And now I'm paying the price. And the future gets closer every day. And I wish I could go back in time maybe to live things differently maybe to live them the same. I think about the past my childhood especially every day. And every single night I dream about the past too. The other day I had one about the last day of Year 11. Ive had hundreds like it all about the last day of secondary school. The thing that haunts me about it is the fact that I dont remember what happened. All I remember is that I never saw any of my peers again after that day. Because I made the conscious decision to leave them and go to a different college. Every single dream I have involves my old school friends. Every one.In case it isn't clear my recent doubts over starting let alone completing or succeeding with my dissertation are related to so many other things that I have consciously often deliberately bottled up over the years and it is years. I know how unhealthy and dangerous it is to do this but I do it anyway because it's easier and because it's been the default way of accepting contemplating and processing my emotions for as long as I can remember. I've never had the desire to tell anyone including family about my most vulnerable thoughts and feelings fears and insecurities becausewellwhere to start? Fear of judgement fear of being misunderstood fear of being understood fear of the literal and emotional consequences on myself and on my relationships the fact that emotions were and are are never discussed in my family or in the few social circles I used to have note haven't had friends for five years. I bottle all of this up. And I'll continue to. But it feels like the bottle is starting to overflow.If anyone has read this far you might as well consider yourself the first person who has ever heard anything that is even remotely as private as what I've just revealed in these last few paragraphs. And if you've read this far and if you are a healthy normal person you will have obviously thought to yourself Yeah he needs therapy. But I don't think I do and I certainly don't want to. Theres a small part of me that desires to let it all out I could write a book about all of my problems but I know that would be a terrifying and draining experience even if it leads to something better. And the desire certainly isn't big enough for me to have serious thoughts about seeking helpfrom anyone in fact. I think thats the bottomline regardless of whether I need help or guidance or advice or support or sympathy I don't think I want it. Not enough anyway. I think Id hate myself for seeking it out because I'd feel like a desperately sad narcissist. I know I'm pathetic dumb probably annoying an embarrassment a failure a waste of space time money and effort but I dont think I'm a narcissist. And I know that people who seek help aren't narcissistic but I would think that I am if I did. So I don't. And I've never sought help from anyone. Not only the serious personal stuff but the little trivial specific things too. Is it because of a deeprooted social anxiety and my complete lack of social confidence ability and experience? Yes. But like with my other anxieties that I probably need help with health anxiety fear of the future fear of the passage of time the fear of failure the fear of work the fear of my dissertation I don't care about help or support or selfimprovement. I dont want any of it because I think it wont work for me or that it doesn't apply to me. I dont want to be helped. And yet here I am writing this.,Anxiety
52776,Anxiety has ruined me Just a vent tbh .I've suffered from anxiety my whole life and as I grow older I feel my anxiety getting progressively worse instead of better. Ironically even therapy scares me as I'm not really one to open up in front of others in fear of burdeningboring them. Sounds silly but I almost feel embarrassed paying someone to help me who otherwise wouldnt give me a second thoughtOn the topic of skills I wholeheartedly believe I have 0 skills. I've always been told I'm smart but no one sees how much time and struggle goes behind good grades. When I'm honest about not being intelligent understandably people think I'm fishing for compliments. Even then I think I just got lucky with good questions and random guesses. Literally no achievement I think I really deserved and was more abt the odds being in my favour. Its all due to subliminals and manifestation rather than talentAs well my social skills are horrendous. I'm so awkward w people and can barely keep a convo going with those close to me. I rely on them to start and keep convos going cause I'm just so boring and unfunny. I have an extremely hard time communicating with males too. Idk I completely stiffen up and come across so awkward. I like art but again I'm not talented at it despite so much practice and was rejected from an art school unsurprisingly. I'm learning to drive and after 3 lessons I still can't move a car without sweating buckets shaking and struggling to control it even moving off is so challenging. I'm expecting to waste a ton of money due to my incompetence at understanding basic instructions and crippling fear. I'm bad at sports games mediocre at cooking and just about everything I've tried. Heck I can't even ride a bikeI couldn't list a single talent I have. Anything I'm half decent at is a result of 5x the effort generally needed. For example I'm currently writing an essay thats taken me all day to understand and plan when it was only meant to be an hour task. There just doesn't seem to be anything 'redeemable' for meMy anxiety has made me become more and more closed off from people. I will sit in toilets at school in fear of being looked at. I never contribute to class in fear of being wrong. I sit on the bus with my hood on so I'm not looked at. Even when I briefly had a job I couldn't work out the basics that everyone learnt in a day. It was very telling that this incompetence wasn't only reflecting in school but other places. Sweating is one of the main symptoms I experience and its created deep rooted insecurities for meI can stay somewhat in peace at home but I do have struggles here and there. But obviously its not practical to rely on home for peace as I fear I will completely isolate myself this way Does anyone have a similar situation?,Anxiety
52777,Please read I have pretty bad health anxiety that developed after trauma 6 months ago. I meditate utilize deep breathing exercises run and read inspirational quotes and seeing a trauma therapist. When I feel pain it's a huge trigger for me! I tried zoloft and had a horrible reaction. I'm on the fence about taking busbar or lexapro. Any suggestions what worked for you with a similar experience? Zoloft I literally slept 2 hours max for 2 weeks straight. Needing some advice from you guys. This is all new for me. Thank you for listening!!!!,Anxiety
52778,My Anxiety remedies Hey yall Im a guy who has felt anxiety all his life it used to be so bad Id wake up every morning and throw up because I always felt anxious to start the day.

52779,What can be the cause and treatment for daily panicanxiety attack? 27M Long story short I'm dealing with mental health for 20 years now and for the last six months or so I have almost every day a panic attack since waking till evening.I see a psychiatrist and psychologist and recently started a new job. I know I have my issues but can't wrap my head around having so much anxiety it's net getting better or easier with time.Usually when im in peak anxiety i go on a few hours listening to music and crying in a dark room bender while smoking to much In the process...I do meditation a trying to walk 23 hours a day but I fucking hate sports and I'm lazy...Thank you I felt the need to vent sorry for shitty English,Anxiety

52782,should i force myself to talk when i am unable to? vent about work and conflict with friend my issues i was having a conversation with a close friend of mine about work settings because i will be having an internship soon. we talked about standard work things and tips but then it lead to talking about my anxiety.i asked if i'm unable to speak because of anxiety how do i communicate that to them? 'them' being my coworkers. for extra context i think this is a common thing but just in case my throat closes up to a degree that it becomes hard to and painful to breathe or speak. obviously i need to breathe so i've learned to tough through it and even so i was able to get an appointment with someone who may be able to help this issue. as for speaking that can be even more painful than breathing so i usually try to tap my throat with my finger and hold up one finger with the other hand to try to communicate that i need a minute and i can't breathespeak.i was worried that may not be enough and i had previously told my friend about my issues. i figured he'd be the right guy to ask especially since he's training to become a therapist. i guessed he may have some ideas i haven't thought about yethe told me to tell my coworkers i need a minute to think and to maybe say it directly. i asked him if i can't talk how do i say it to them directly? i'm bad with conveying tone partially because i'm autistic so i can see in hindsight that it may have come off wrong.he asked me if i was just going to leave or stay quiet without telling them what was going on and he also said that the situation would just become worse. i was starting to get a bit upset and i said that i knew that. then he told me to learn how to force myself to say it.that's where i became really upset. i have no idea if this was justified or not all i know is how much it hurt. i tired my best to remind him of some of my tics and how if i'm stressed enough to be unable to speak forcing myself would DEFINATELY make the situation worse. i told him about how there's been times where i've gotten overwhelmed and anxious which led to me accidently hitting someone rarely or most commonly myself. sometimes i'll have really bad ones which make me yell fling my arm beside my head or slam a fist down on a table.i then apologized. he then told me that it's unfair but i have to vocalize that kind of thing. i worked some things out with another close friend of mine and we both agreed that i should maybe carry around some laminated cards on a ring with common words and sayings to help me communicate. we also talked about telling my coworkers and employers beforehand about my issues and how i need a few minutes to myself to calm down.i tried messaging the friend from before saying that i wanted to talk. i apologized for getting upset and explained that i was hurt by what he said and that i was hoping we can talk about it all. i apologized again. i've seen he's read the message but he hasn't responded. i'm a bit worried but trying to be patient with out differing time zones.should i force myself to talk when i am unable to especially with some of my issues? i want to believe i'm not at fault but i feel horrible about getting upset and i'm wondering if he's right and i should just try to suck it up.edit i also worry that i may have overreacted and blown up over something unimportant. it's just so infuriating and hurtful because i've been told all my life to force myself to do things and to just toughen up and deal with it. i've been called overly emotional and at this point any slight indication someone thinks that way kind of sets me off. i'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense i struggle putting these things into words.,Anxiety

I have thoughts because there are little places to go that I'm wasting my time and I'm usually in my room all day thinking watching tv or sleeping. I have thoughts that I'm not being productive and that there arent many things I could do to be productive. This is what concerns me most. I'm doing a degree and that's the only productive thing I'm doing. I feel trapped in a boring lifestyle and i'm also living with my parents..

I work in a large corporate environment and whenever I get emails directed at me or regarding tasks related to me especially direct asks my anxiety skyrockets.

I am a full time student and work 30 hours a week and I am in the Army Ng not to mention I have also moved a lot recently and my few off days are spent running errands or appointments. Due to this there have been several times I log into my classes and see that I JUST missed the deadline for an assignment.

Now I nearly have a panic attack each time I log into my classes but I also need to do it.. Kinda just getting that off my chest but will also take advice,Anxiety
52795,how did buspironebuspar make you feel? did you take it consistently or only as needed? hi anxious friends! i recently switched my meds from effexor to prozac and added buspirone 10mg for anxiety. my doctor told me to take it as needed but after all the research ive done this doesn't make sense to me. how would it even be effective if i only took it as needed if it's not a fastimmediate acting drug? it builds up in your system over time right? so i'd need to take it consistently for a long period of time to feel any effects? ill ask my doctor too of course but im very interested in other people's experiences with buspirone specifically and whether you took it as needed or daily. ive been taking 10mg 3x a day for about a month with some missed doses in between and i do feel less anxious but the way my doctor described it made it sound like it was a fast acting anti anxiety drug that calms you down after you take a dose rather than one that builds in your system over time. if it matters i also take concerta and bupropion. thanks friends ,Anxiety

52805,Redditors with trust issues due to childhood trauma how do you cope and build trust with others? am a 19yearold college student trying to make the best of my life despite my past. Growing up I had a difficult childhood. My father and stepfather were both abusive and would often beat me up for the smallest reasons. I remember hiding in my room and praying that they would leave me alone but it never worked.My mom was an alcoholic and she never showed me any love or affection. She was always too drunk to care about anything that was going on in my life. I felt like I was all alone in the world and I had no one to turn to.As a result of my childhood I developed a deep sense of trust issues. I find it hard to open up to people and let them in. I am constantly afraid that they will hurt me in some way just like my father and stepfather did.But despite all of this I refuse to let my past define me. I am determined to make something of myself and create a better life for me. College has been a fresh start for me and I have made some friends who seem to genuinely care about me.However even with my newfound friendships I still find it hard to trust people. I am always on guard and keep people at arm's length afraid that they will hurt me like my father and stepfather did.Sometimes I wish I could forget about my past and start anew but it's always there in the back of my mind haunting me. It's hard to let go of the pain and the memories that shaped me into the person I am today.But I refuse to let my past hold me back. I am determined to overcome my trust issues and build a better future for myself.,Anxiety

52810,Havent worked a job in a year and a half pitiful rant The last job I had was back in October 2021 doing lowskilled IT work at a hospital and I got fired worked there two months the longest Ive ever held a job. Im in my early 20s and its embarrassing to admit that but its true. I cant keep a job. I either quit after a short while or in this instance get chucked out. ampx200BSince then Ive avoided work all together as all I feel is bitterness and shame. Another deterrent is how Im not good at anything in particular. All I can get are shit jobs where Im completely replaceable. ampx200BIm too shy and anxious all the time so talking to people is really hard. When I worked at a cinema it wasnt too bad because there were people my age and I felt good talking to them but that job went to pieces because management hated me long story. ampx200BIm told to get a skill but the idea of getting a trade sounds harrowing to me as Ive worked on construction sites and the people who work there are usually abrasive cokeheads who I really wouldnt get along withtolerate. ampx200BAll Ive done for the past year is read write listen to music and occasionally socialise but Im pretty much alone now. I guess when youre socially isolated its hard to really know yourself like you cant test yourself much in a public setting so its hard to truly know who you are. I find it hard sometimes. Just thinking about what jobs would suit me it seems impossible. I know what I dont want to do but thats pretty much everything to be honest. The idea of working a job again commuting forcing myself to speak to people who I dont want to be around and doing these mundane things feels like death isnt so bad. Considering the sort of jobs I can get which are garbage service jobs or lowskilled office ones with high turnovers. ampx200BSo Im stuck. I feel really trapped. The job centre is harassing me and I hate going in there as I feel like such a lowlife but on the same token I can barely afford the upkeeps for my car so Ill have to work some shit job soon I suppose. ampx200BIm not on medication or anything I feel embarrassed typing this out. Im scared of telling anyone my problems as I was always told theyre insignificant and I should man up even though the same people who told me that complain and talk about how bad their lives are all the time to me and never ask about how Im doing. So whatever. Seeing a GP in this country is a joke anyway so theres zero point trying to get help anyways. I tried to be ambitious and maybe move countries but I dont even have any qualifications like I dont have a degree so my options are very limited. Id love to move countries and just forget about how bad my life sucks here but I cant do that regrettably so I guess Ill have to accept my lot in life working these miserable hapless jobs until I eventually murder myself or go crazy,Anxiety
52811,Im so truly exhausted. I dont know why my brain is the way it is anymore and it hurts. Im struggling so much. Heres my story if you want to stick around to read it. Last year about this same time I got Covid probably the worst thing I have ever gone through in my entire life besides the horrible sickness part somehow it sparked some sort of new anxiety in me. Before it I never experienced anxiety like I do now but somehow it came on painfully out of no where. Panic attacks more than once a day unable to control my thoughts horrible intrusive thoughts nightmares insomnia constant fidgeting amp some angerirritability for no reason at all. After a month or two from healing from Covid Covid long haul I was getting better no more panic attacks able to drive get out and be happy. I was okay till now. One night I woke up a little too early so I decided to stay up instead of falling back asleep for three or so hours and boom it was back. My mind went straight back to the anxiety the irritability and pain as before but without the anxiety.Its been a few weeks or so now since it started and I feel so tired and mentally drained.I started some anxiety meds Buspirone 5mg 2x and havent seen a massive amount of change yet.

52815,Anyone felt like this? So first off I apologize for the millionth post about has anyone felt like this. Been struggling to post anything for that reason. Ive been having really bad anxiety these past 23 months. My dad passed away in December and I had to put my dog down a week ago so I definitely think this has affected my greatly. Ive never felt this bad for this long. Been waking up most days shakey and nervous. Most days Im worrying about my health and cant seem to shake off intrusive thoughts. I went to the Doctor on Thursday and was told my blood pressure was high which made me more anxious. Was precribed some for blood pressure and sertraline for the anxiety. Today Ive been feeling dizzy it comes and goes and just loosing interest in normal things. Just a general feeling of feeling off or not all here. Also cant seem to swallow very well. Im starting to exercise more and eating healthier. Im hoping to see if anyone has any words of encouragement or has had a similar experience as mine. Also anyone taking sertraline has any side effects? Anything would help rn. Thank you!Edit Side note last night I took a chocolate piece which had cbd and a strand of THC to help me sleep. It made me feel slow and like I wasnt fully there and gave me really bad dry mouth feeling. Idk if maybe Im still feeling those symptoms because still feel out of it and my throat feels like I have something stuck there.,Anxiety
52816,Is there a specific term or phobia that one gets about fearing that their heart won't stop beating fast if they trigger it? Examples could be exercise or a panic attack? I sadly developed mild agoraphobia cause of this ,Anxiety
52817,Does it look bad if I dont go to my friends aunts funeral? I cant tell if Im letting my anxiety get in the way of social norms. I really dont want to go to this funeral. Its my friends aunt who sadly passed suddenly. My friend spoke a lot about her but Ive never met her so I feel weird going to this funeral. My friend is kind of expecting me to pay my respects and I dont know how to tell her that I cant go. Am I letting my anxiety get the better of me by not going or is it reasonable not to go to this funeral? For context Ive known my friend since high school and were both in out early 30s. and Im reasonably close to her.Edit I did go and it was fine and it made her happy. So in the end Im glad I did something good,Anxiety
52818,every strange thing thats happened in the last 24 hours. please read . 14M. As a bit of background I am currently in therapy for anxiety depression OCD and for the last six weeks i have been on 50mg of sertraline a day and 2 lots of 20mg promethazine a day. since yesterday morning i havent felt great but i atleast thought that the medication was working . was feeling depressed a bit the night before but something was drastically different.I woke up and felt like i was incoherent but i wasnt and began to feel very depressed. i put it down to just a bad day and i read online sertraline can cause depressive feelings . i continued on with my day not worrying until the nighttime . just before i was going to get into bed something didnt feel right. i started to feel strange in ways i cant describe and I had these 1 second headaches in the same spot every 510 minutes . my memory then began to feel weird and i checked my blood pressure which was normal. I then grabbed my playstation controller and headset and put it by my bedside which i never do . i always leave it on my desk. this freaked me out but then again that could just be down to tiredness .I got into bed and checked by blood pressure again. all normal. but something didnt feel right at all. it felt like i was living in yesterday and then i suddenly got this strange feeling and this is the best way of describing it it felt like I wasnt conscious but i was at the same time . like to recall my memory it feels like none of that happened except it did . the world felt deaf and it felt like time was no longer linear . i felt as if i couldnt process things properly if at all. and thought brain bleed.I then went to the bathroom and felt panicked but didnt show it . I checked my pupils and they were fine . i then went back to my bedroom and began to text people ok reddit for advice and said it all sounds like anxiety. at this point my brain was telling me that I was forgetting something but i dont know what because thats the whole point of forgetting something . I began to feel like I was in a delirious state and i felt as if i couldnt hang on to a thought process. I was worried as this was not normal for me so i woke up my dad and told him what was happening . at this point when I was trying to read something i searched up on google the words looked jumbled and i had to read it again. this has never been an issue before and i certainly dont have dyslexia so this made me worry .I explained to my dad that the way I was feeling was not normal so i asked him if I could call 111 urgent care number . I explained to them my situation and i was put on call later to a man who literally asked my father what he thought he should do if i was feeling delirious . at this point i realised it was pointless . he basically said it sounds like nothing physically but i disagreed. Exhausted of all my options i decided to go to sleep. I got around 7 hours and slept straight through and had vivid detailed dreams .I woke up around 11am after going to bed around 4am. I still had memory troubles but not nearly as bad as the night before . I tried to convince myself I was fine and realised i still felt strange and the letters looked a bit jumbled still. Ive tried to brush it off all day but still feeling weird. a recent feeling in the past 67 hours ive attained is the feeling like im waking up and suddenly realising im doing something while im doing it subconsciously . but if i backtrack and i try to remember it all feels fine. just not in the moment. this is the thing that is freaking me out . any advice please ? any at all? does this sound like a brain bleed mental confusiondelirium? or could this be explained by anxiety derealization tiredness? so scared honestly dont know what to do.,Anxiety
52820,Separation Anxiety Hi everyone! 22 F here. My anxiety and panic attacks flared up in december and ever since then i have developed separation anxiety from my parents. The trigger is when i hear them get ready in the morning to go to work it makes me anxious. When they leave i usually watch harry potter and play games on my ipad to distract me. i know these are safety behaviors and they reinforce the anxiety. What do i do? im tapering off of effexor which has heightened my anxiety but im at a stand still and dont know how to change this.,Anxiety

52829,Crippling new job anxiety Hi allIve started a new job about 2 weeks ago its a higher paying customer care job for an insurance company. I was in retail for 5 years and incredibly comfortable in my position. Its a work from home role I needed something different as retail was driving me up the wall and I can put on a damn good customer service facade. Anyway today Ive been taking calls and all of a sudden became overwhelmed with everything and burst into tears. I cried during a call and could not stop crying until I logged out. Ive spent the entire evening on the phone to my parents crying and crying to my partner. Im dreading doing it again. I was ready to quit.How do you deal with this? Im breathing taking my meds eating well and drinking well. My brain is causing problems out of nothing and Ive been making myself sick over this job. Anyone dealt with this in their new job and how did you overcome it?,Anxiety

For as long as I can remember Ive had pretty bad anxiety but always had then fuck it suck it up mentality about it. Also should heavily self medicate since I was about 14 when I first found opiates. Now that Im sober my anxiety is crippling. Have had 3 job interview since being clean and all 3 went horribly cause of my anxiety hard to talk to people family and my girlfriendwho is almost completely sober and rarely drinks. I also cant sleep and constantly having nightmares. was wondering if anyone has any recommendations of meditation to try for it thats not a benzodiazepine cause Im still so fresh in recovery. Honestly would do anything besides benzos. Thanks for hearing me out,Anxiety

52832,Anxiety Over Having Made No Accomplishments in Life I'm almost 40 so my life is nearly half over and I feel like I've done nothing with it. Especially because for some stupid reason I've placed all my eggs in one basket and insisted on becoming a successful author no matter how stupid or hard or impossible it is to do that these days. I haven't even tried to date anyone in over 10 years so though I'd like a relationship I'm socially inept and awkward. I also have a lot of baggage not just from an abusive father but from two abusive relationships I was stupid enough to get into. At my age with my history no one wants to even attempt to deal with that nonsense and as I said I'm inept at socializing because of my own problems. I don't have a career like my siblings. I don't have a family. I don't even have a job because of a permanent disability making it almost impossible for me to work. Though I have written several novels they more than likely will never see anything resembling profit or commercial success. Most of my days are spent playing video games hating my life and writing because I'm too stubborn to give up on that dream despite every single sign telling me that I'm old it's over and there's no way I'm talented enough to make it work. I know that people will say that I shouldn't measure my success by other people or people around me but let me tell you. It's exceedingly hard to show up to family functions when all your siblings are married professionals with their own houses and you are the loser who has been single for 15 years because she can't manage to get into a relationship that's not abusive and would prefer to stay at home alone with her cat who's gonna die soon anyway because he's old. If you want to suggest therapy or medication...I've done both. Medication isn't a fix for me and I've tried it on and off for years. Therapy has been a constant in my life since I was 18 so if you can possibly imagine it I was far worse than this before now. If anything I could possibly say it's a miracle that I've come as far as I have with recovering from abuse dealing with addiction an eating disorder and my anxiety issues. Yet at the same time I desire things that I'm 99 sure I can never have and I know I'm running out of time. Is there any way to cope with the fact that my life just isn't going to get fixed and I'm pretty much doomed to waiting the clock out for the next 3040 years if I'm somehow lucky enough not to get cancer or some other terrible disease?,Anxiety
52833,Physical side of Anxiety Possible emetophobia amp coprophobia TriggersI dont typically share on here and Im unfamiliar with Reddit but my partner suggested I give it a go. I experienced something this morning and I believe it to be related to my anxiety. I woke up and started completing my typically morning routine all was well. I came to the end of the list of things I have to do in my head. I left very sick to my stomach. Ive been trying to become more aware of my anxiety symptoms and have noticed they often show as tummy issues. Typically physical both feeling like I need to vomit and poop my pants. I ran to the bathroom and vomited. I had to reach out to my boss and explain the situation. I woke with children. I was also informed and asked about my colleague whom I work with directly they were possibly going to be out for the day as well causing a staffing issue. I feel guilty and a lot of other emotions about the situation. It feels like I let my team down. I also have a tendency to think and help others without thinking about myself in the process. The ultimate people pleaser. I was just hoping someone out there in the universe experiences anything similar to me. If so I appreciate you Thank you for taking the time to read Id love to chat ,Anxiety
52834,anxiety progressmy story Hey guys! Ive been following this community for a while and I just wanted to share my story and maybe meet some people going through or who have been through a similar situation. I've never felt more alone in my life and I feel like I'll be heard here. Im 21 and growing up wasnt easy. I carry a lot of trauma and guilt from seeing my mom sick pretty much my whole life and growing up in a toxic environment. I always took care of my mom from a young age which made me very attached to her and honestly even though she was sick she was really the best mother I couldve ever asked for. fast forward after a lot of treatment and a lot of struggle my mom recovered and 2022 was one of her best years. she was very healthy and started doing very well. It was the best year for my family and me as a whole. unfortunately that came to an end and she suddenly passed in November 2022. That came as a big shock to everyone because she was so healthy. no health problems regular tests she was perfectly fine. Everything for me came crashing down. I've always had anxiety and due to that anxiety I was vaping heavily for so many years 6 to be exact until February 6th 2023 came around. I had one of the worst panic attacks ever and now I'm dealing with so many symptoms. Got so many tests done because I was having so many strokelike and heart attacklike symptoms. Tests came back pretty much all normal and I got diagnosed with a panic disorder and health anxiety. My psychiatrist thinks due to my mom passing away so suddenly and I also have an underlying fear for myself.I'm writing this because I've never felt so alone. I feel like people close to me don't understand what I'm going through physically and mentally and I just want to be my old self again. All these symptoms started so suddenly and I'm scared almost every day not knowing if I will wake up the next day or what might happen to me. I'm scared my own body will fail me. I'm tired and I'm tired of feeling like I'm in this alone. I'm trying my best to correlate everything with anxiety but it's so hard. Thank you so much for reading if you did read all of this. I will be okay and I will get better. I'm slowly starting to see progress. Cheers to a lovely life ahead ,Anxiety

Due to a history of substance abuse I cannot take benzos which severely hinders my ability to be treated with medicine.Knowing that background I have SEVERE travel anxiety. Tomorrow I have to travel to NYC from CT which is a literal train ride plus the subway to get downtown and I am in a panic. Part of it is leaving my baby for the first time since I had him 9 months ago but a bigger part is that I just HATE traveling. The crowds the unknown the potential of getting lost it all sends me in a tailspin.Does anyone have any tips to ease me a bit? Ive already mapped out my route and gone over and over it.

52839,fomo from things im not involved in does anyone else get this? recently i watched a tv show and have become a bit obsessed with it and the relationship between the 2 main characters both in the show and in real life. its not even a romantic relationship its a fatherdaughter type. and i have a good relationship with my dad so im not sure where the feelings are coming from but i cant shake them. i keep thinking about the show and how good it was and how beautiful their relationship is. and then my social medias keep showing me edits and clips from interviews etc that just make me more interested. but i always end up feeling sad after because im not a part of it? at least i think thats what the feeling is. im wondering if anyone else has felt like this and how you explain it? or what you did to move on or look at it in a more positive way. im tired of feeling sad.,Anxiety

52847,I live with two people in my family who have schizophrenia and there was a butcher knife placed on a picture of me im a 19 year old cc student and i live with my grandma mom uncle aunt and little sister.my mom has a meth addiction and shes developed schizophrenia from it and its been getting worse as the years go on. my uncle was hit on the head at a young age and im not exactly sure what he struggles since we never talk but i think its schizophrenia. my mom doesnt take her meds i think and my grandma is constantly trying to help her with moving in and out of motels and rehabs and all this stuff for the past 8 months or so realistically shes been trying to help her for many many years now but my mom had moved out recently my mom moved back in like a week ago. my uncle is very strange and i dont know really anything about him. he leaves his room a few times a day and doesnt talk to anyone sometimes i hear him talk to himself in his room but he doesnt yell and scream like my mom does hes just very quiet and intense. so earlier tonight i was using my grandmas phone for school since mine was dead and i got curious to look in her messages between my mom because ive seen messages between them before where my mom is talking about how she hears voices talking about someone wanting to kill me and how shes constantly was thinking about me and she doesnt think im safe. so i looked and my aunt shes mentally well sent my grandma a picture where she found a big butcher knife placed on top of a picture of me. the message said uncles name is acting strange again. i asked moms name if she did this and she said she didnt. does uncles name know what it means to stab someone? that they will die? in the photo my aunt sent my grandma the picture of me was in like a mouse pad that was custom made with a photo of me from 4th grade. the thing is im not sure if its a coincidence because the mouse pad is on a desk for like where a computer used to be but the desk in like directly connected to the kitchen like almost next to it so it could be possible that someone had happened to place that knife there so i didnt really freak out. but i talked to some friends and when i kinda said it out loud to them i did kinda realize like damn that does kinda sound bad and they told me that yea its probably not safe. i dont know if it was my uncle or mom either though if it even was intentional. my uncle used to come home and hit me in the head as a kid a lot and we would yell and scream at each other we lived together for like 6 years and this would happen then we moved then we moved again and he moved back in with us but ever since we moved back in again we literally do not talk to each other at all. hes very awkward around me and everyone tbh and quiet and i can tell he doesnt like to be in the same room as me even though i do not interact with him at all whatsoever. weve said hey to each other like less than 10 times over the years and thats about it. he does kinda seem like he hates me but i dont think he would want to kill me. on the other hand its possible that my mom was lying to my aunt but from what ive seen i dont think my mom wants to kill me either. whenever she has talked about me in that way its more of a this is my son i need to protect him from whoever gonna kill him type of way rather than a malicious tone. but again they are both schizophrenic which i really dont know much about besides they can be unpredictable and so thats why im asking. i know its weird to ask about this on reddit but i really dont have anyone to talk to about it. im not going to directly confront my uncle about it because again we are very distant and hes a big guy i just dont want to i feel like itd be worse and i dont want to ask my mom because i know she would say no even if she did. im going to ask my grandma tomorrow since i havent been able to since shes been asleep all night but shes just going to ignore me after i express my concerns which she always does. i can talk to my aunt about it even though were not really too close but yeah. another thing is my grandma sent the photo my aunt sent her to my uncle asking if he did it and he kind of just ignored it didnt deny it so. but yea i cant really move out or anything i dont have the money for that since i just graduated high school and honestly i dont have a job right now since im a full time student and i just dont know where i would go. i dont have any friends that would let me live with them either so thats out of the picture . the best thing im hoping for is the convince my grandma to have them move out but thatll probably never happen even though i want it to so bad. i just dont know if this is a coincidence with the knife and i shouldnt be worried or what i should do so yea pls help,Anxiety

52850,Anyone here also feels like they'll be Lonely Forever because of Social Anxiety? I think ever since I was bullied in school I always was afraid of people. I missed so many opportunities in my life because no matter how many self help books I was reading I was just not able to overcome my anxiety. And even if I managed to be normal around people I still felt lonely. Because I felt like an alien like I was different to everyone else. A normal relationship with a woman who accepts me for who I am? gt Not available since I finished school! Friends with whom I can share my hopes and dreams and who I feel deeply connected with? gt Not for me! Just interact with people without feeling completely nervous and socially awkward? gt Impossible!With 22 I knew that either I have to change something or it will stay like this forever!It was a wild journey ever since and despite a lot of set backs rejections insecurities and the feeling that I am too unlovable for anyone I can say that I overcame my social anxiety.I don't want to brag with this post the only thing I want is to give you hope in times where you maybe feel no hope.Maybe this here is the motivation for YOU to take the first step today. To look out of the comfort zone a tiny little bit. To get help when you need help as it is a sign of strength to ask for help not of weakness. If this here reaches one person who is struggling today I've done my job.Because no matter how tall the wall seem that you are looking at right now it is possible to overcome it.If you need help or advice I'll be there for you in the comments! ,Anxiety
52851,Im really scared and proud Ive been taking the same adhd pill since I was a very small child and I had to switch on weekends due to a shortage. I have some history with certain pills and their side effects which is why I am so anxious. Not the average side effects either the 1 that most people dont get. The side effects were facial and tongue cramping due to a severe allergic reaction slurred speech throat swelling and a tic like thing called Tardive dyskinesia I am having waves of panic attacks but I am so fucking proud of myself. I faced my fear I took the pill. I did it. I faced my anxiety. This is a first as I usually cower to it. My anxiety is still going but its not used to me challenging it.,Anxiety
52852,What tf us happening to me Every single day I feel the life inside of me just fall down as if it were sand every day I feel like I can't breathe I just sit and look around because even though no one sees it I feel like my lings are vomiting inside me.Every single day I want to kill myself while at the same time having a panic attack because I don't want to die.And then I just sit there not bothering anyone because no one can look at me and tell me my intestines are silently spinning no one can look at me and see my heart beating way too fast and know I'm not breathing.And certainly no one knows that every fucking day while I try to live my life I see myself in a grave not feeling any physical sensation at all its almost as if I can see the future almost as if old me is sitting in bed slowly rotting away dead and no one has checked up on me for several hoursWhy tf am I like this I'm 14 I'm supposed to enjoy life but insead I hate this shit and I hate living with this terrible anxiety about nothing and everything at the same time not living because I don't wanna die which makes me want to kill myselfThe worst part is I'm not even diagnosed with an anxiety disorder because I'm too scared to talk to anyone about it and so no one will ever know because I don't know people well enough to tell them this. I guess I don't mind sharing with strangers online thoHope you have a nice day and I hope your anxiety gets better because I wish no ine had to suffer like this,Anxiety
52853,Can anxiety get triggered by nothing? I dont know how to explain it but the last week or two I have been in a constant panic mode. always on edge I feel sick 247 crying etc. But nothing has triggered me ?

52854,Crazy how powerful thought diaries amp breathing techniques have been for my anxiety I've been undergoing therapy for anxiety and depression for the past two months. My therapist recommended that I start keeping a thought diary to write down any worries or concerns that I may have and to practice a breathing technique that involves breathing in for four seconds holding for two and then exhaling for four seconds.Initially I was skeptical that these simple practices could make a difference in something that has troubled me for years. However I began to notice that whenever I started to become consumed by anxious or depressive thoughts jotting them down in my diary helped me immensely. This process allowed me to break down those thoughts and identify that 99 of the time my worries and depression stem from hypothetical situations.For instance one of my thoughts was What if my friends are judging me behind my back? for context this was after we went out for drinks. The key phrase in that being 'What if' meaning it's just hypothetical with no real evidence to back up the worry. So in my thought diary alongside my worrisome thought I would write down a 'Helpful thought' where I deconstruct this worry. For the aforementioned thought my helpful thought wasThis is a hypothetical worry you have no evidence to suggest this will happen. Your friend's opinion of you shouldn't be taken seriously anyway. You don't need to seek approval from your friends.Of course this may not help everyone but I wanted to share how thought diaries have helped my mental health and they can be quite powerful. TLDR My therapist recommended keeping a thought diary and practicing breathing techniques to help my anxiety and depression. Writing down my thoughts and using the breathing technique has helped me identify that 99 of my worries are hypothetical. I recommend trying it out.,Anxiety

52856,Ive been trying to get help for months its so frustrating Our healthcare system is so over burdened. The psychiatrist in town has an almost 9 month wait list but I finally got in. The communityparent support worker I was connected to cancelled our sessions because their department ran out of funding the program was cut. Im waiting until they announce the new budget in April and get more funding. Then Ill get a worker backIm giving every ounce of effort I have to get the supports I need and use them so that I can learn to function on my own. I have a 4 year old and I hate how im raising him. I feel like an asshole trying to explain to my dr that even though my house is full of food I struggle to feed him properly because I have no appetite I dont cook for myself and I dont know what to feed him. I look at all the food in my cupboard and I cant make a decision on what to make. But then my son tells me hes hungry right now so I just microwave a pizza pocket or corn dog for him. Im just so tired. Im failing at everything. Ive reached out for support and the people in the roles want to help me bc they see me trying. My psychiatrist even has seen me on his days off. Its just the system as a whole that is underfunded and broken,Anxiety
52857,xanax please help hi. this is going to be a bit of a long post. I have suffered from emetophobia for 8 years now. Have been and am still going to therapy on antidepressants and have been on hydroxyzine. Recently my doctor prescribed me .5mg of xanax every day. This has spiked my anxiety because I know I can gain a tolerance to it and become addicted. I have never misused it or done anything wrong but I feel guilty for using it every day and Im scared Ill become addicted and have withdrawals. Can someone give me some insight on this please?,Anxiety
52858,just some thoughts for you be patient with yourself.its okay to say no. YOU are experiencing your life. nobody knows how you feel. your feelings are valid and its okay to set boundaries. its okay if you cant do it today. it takes a lot of energy for you to always fight against your worries and anxiety. so its totally understandable if you need some space and peace. dont surround yourself with people that drain your energy. its okay to let them go. this gives you more energy to focus on the good people and things in your life.i hope you have a good day today. but also dont have too much expectations. its totally fine if not everything is going to work out today.,Anxiety

52860,Some advice to my people HelloI've been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks my whole life and while I take a ridiculous amount of meds for it including lorazapam pregablin etc I was informed about Magnesium and I wanted to share this with you.So a lot of us get anxiety attacks triggered by the stress hormone cortisol magnesium works by by stimulating the production of melatonin and serotonin which boost your mood and help you sleep. Magnesium also reduces the production of cytokines and cortisol which lead to increased inflammation and stress.It's important that you don't over do it as you can poison yourself with magnesium and you also have to make sure it's aspartate citrate lactate and chloride forms as oxide apparently doesn't absorb as well.Speak to your pharmacist or Dr if you're mixing medication but I have been able to reduce the amount of lorazapam I've needed since starting mag and its helped a lot with sleep. I'm truly impressed.,Anxiety

52862,Horrible Fear of Food Being Drugged Lately Ive been having this massively irrational fear of my food being laced with LSD or some other form of psychedelics. I wont eat something thats been already opened regardless of whether or not its mine which has led to me not only wasting food but actively avoiding eating unless I make it right there and even then it takes quite a bit of effort. This in turn has also led me to having a fear of an undiagnosed mental illness and I cant quite afford to go to a doctor currently to figure out if that is the case.Ive only ever been technically drugged once when the cannabis my friend bought was laced with PCP a few months ago but this fear extends back to when I was around fifteen twenty three now. Ive done acid only twice and while I did enjoy it its not something Im likely to do again and I rarely smoke cannabis or drink but I did do a lot of both for a few years. Obviously nobody is gonna waste good acid on me but the fear is constantly there to the point that I yelled at my brother the other day for jokingly pretending to drop something into my Gatorade on the way to work hes unaware of this fear and threw it away despite it being completely full and even avoided eating the cookies my mom brought down for Christmas which made me feel awful as there is absolutely no way my mom would ever do anything like that to me.Im iffy on telling anybody close to me about this fear for a few reasons the main one being the irrationality of it all but I also do not want to be sent to an inpatient center again cant afford it as I was for depression as a minor. Sorry for the rambling wall of text but I just need to know if this is signs of a more major illness or at the very least how I can possibly cope with it.,Anxiety
52863,Hurry sickness is driving me crazy. Does anyone else have this? I have hurry sickness and it's linked to my anxiety and BPD. It causes me so much anxiety because I always feel like I need to do many things at the same time or short period of time. I drink my coffee in about 5 minutes then I read a book for an hour then I listen to music and surf the web for a nonspecific reason. Everything has to be done very fast and wellplanned if not I get impatient irritable and anxious. It's pretty exhausting and I realized it's a problem going on for two years now. I did not pay too much attention to this before since I didn't even know there was a term for this condition. Does anyone else experience something similar? How are you dealing with it?,Anxiety

52865,Asked my parents who I don't live with for an extra 10 or so a week spending money and they've turned it into a big thing I am currently under an intense care plan as an outpatient at a mental health hospital. One of the nurses suggested asking for an extra amount of allowance. 'well off' but not rich parents completely fund me while I'm at university as my loan is less than my rent.I was debating asking for weeks me and my parents have had a strained relationship in the past to say the least some definitely their fault some a mix of both of our faults. Anyway it's left a gap between us that I haven't been brave enough to cross.But last night I asked them told them I wasn't struggling with the current allowance it would purely be for an extra nice thing a week to help me get by during these times. IMO they've blown it way out of proportion they wanted a phone call today to log all my spending and now they're wanting to come and visit me TODAY. It's sending my anxiety haywire this is why I don't open up or ask anything from my parents.What do I do? Say no to them visiting all together? I'm 100 fine with keeping the current allowance I just want a yes or a no to have some closure on this conversation with my parents.So I'll repeat my question with your limited knowledge of my life What do I do??,Anxiety

52869,Doctors notesrecords Hi just wondering if anybody knows about if doctors think you are drug seeking do they put that on your record? I went to doctors yesterday didnt see my usual GP it was about spinal pain that radiates up my back only seems to hurt after physical activity which is weird but concerning to me. The day before appointment I went gym amp done some light training on back muscles which really set it off was painful amp felt weird afterwards like weakness in my arms bit dizzy and just a general weak feeling like really weak and disorientated. She was not helpful at all basically done a quick ops check checked my back briefly amp said it seems ok. She said to rest on weekend and see how I go she said hot water bottle. The more im thinking about my appointment with a her yesterday I get the impression she feels I was drug seeking. I never asked for any drugs but I feel she was misunderstanding me being concerned with trying to get drugs. She said something when I sat down like youre looking to discuss pain management I didnt really take it in as was really anxious and tired so I said yeah about my spine then proceeded to talk about my concerns but not once did I say anything about wanting medicationsdrugs. Im annoyed now I should of been clear that I would of liked a referral to be checked out or something. Im on pregabalin for anxiety it also just happens to be a nerve pain drug and she said few times about youll have review soon with usual GP to see if its helping my anxiety and not just about pain management. She also said youve only upped dosage 10 days ago. I didnt really take it in properly at the time but I feel she thinks I was trying to up my dose or get pain meds? Im worried now that it will be on my notes and Im also frustrated that I didnt correct her properly. Any advice or help on this would be appreciated im very anxious about this I feel I was totally misunderstood and I dont like the thought of her putting on notes I was looking for pain management or medication to help that. I also noticed as I was leaving she done a frustrated sigh. This experience has made me feel invalidated misunderstood and made my anxiety and depression worse. Im struggling mentally very very bad to say the least.,Anxiety

I've been on Abilify and Alprazolam for years never had been feeling alert on them always either sleepy or have weird feeling in my stomach. Now I've tried everything with these meds be it smoking or alcohol I stopped all of it because it caused very nasty problems with me when I stopped I finally felt myself even through I've read on Wikipedia that coffee can also cause problems when you take these meds it's says even small amounts can cause side effects that's called caffeine induced anxiety.I'm not really sure how am I supposed to be awake I mean I'm unemployed still in hands of my parents and other family members who take care of me and understand my problems but how did you manage to stay awake without coffee or did coffee really help you without feeling weird all time while on meds? It would be stupid for me to sleep all day and miss some important events or have fun chatting with friends or playing video games or better yet studying different topics like electrical engineering or making homemade circuits. Not electrical engineer just doing something for hobby.,Anxiety

I enjoy the rush of learning new things and knowing things but when it push comes to shove and I need to practice what Im learning thats when I usually find out I still have a long way to go and will have to fail and make mistakes and actually suck at that thing for a while. Its like I just want to skip to the good part. I feel like the work is only productiveuseful when its good.How do you even deal with the uncomfortable parts of learning and growing? I just keep pushing on but sometimes it feels like Im making no progress at all.

52879,Advice Ive been dealing with some anxiety issues my whole life. Ive had lots of trama and was diagnosed with ADHD as a young child. Never being able to focus and always the most loud and distributive in school. I used to stay up at night as a kid because after watching the slightest scary movie I would be afraid. Anyways the point of the backstory is to give you a sense of who I was. Lately within the past year my anxiety has been through the roof. I find it very hard to focus and have lots of thoughts at once. Even some that just pop into my head. I can hear other peoples tone of voice. Not like big conversation. My anxiety was so high I was getting lots of physical symptoms heart palpitations chest pain shortness of breath to which I thought I had a heart problem. So I went to the doctors and got all the tests and didnt believe my heart was fine until I got the results. I thought about this everyday. To which now I think this might had been a delusion. My point is Im very worried Im developing Schizophrenia. My family does have a history of mental health issues.I know this post is confusing and if Im worried about my mental health I should see a doctor. But Im just looking for advice.EditI would like to add that for a long time when I went home after a long day I could not relax to fall asleep. My mind would be racing. The only way I could describe it is like a radio. In order to drown it out I would have to put on music to fall asleep.,Anxiety

52881,Anxiety has ruined my life... I need some advicehelp Gonna be a little long gonna rant a bitLittle back story 20yearold male no past history of major anxiety other than flying on planes etc..Last year from January to April was feeling the best I have ever felt in my life! worked out 67 days a week confidence was high and not a care in the world. I would say around May I started getting increasingly fatigued every day. As the days went on it felt like I was detached from reality. By the end of the year I felt so detached fatigued and had major brain fog. I have a small bump on the back of my head it doesn't hurt I got it checked out and the doc said it could be a skull deformity. I dont believe her. I convinced myself that I had something wrong with me and I went down the rabbit hole of selfdiagnosing by reading google i know worst idea ever. I could only function to the fraction I could before my snapping point. I felt so depolarized and had no energy at this point. I convinced myself I had a chronic illness that I was going to die from I still belive this I got every scan and lab work done. Nothing came of it. I had no idea what was causing all of these symptoms. Fast forward to January I started a very stressful college class. It is an intensive academytype class. I thought I had my stress pretty well controlled but in February I had my first panic attack ever. Went to school that day feeling fine didn't eat breakfast but drank 180mg of caffeine I usually have 300mg a day. During the afternoon portion of the class I felt this sense of impending doom and shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest. For 2 hours my HR was in the 130s. I had no Idea what was going on and felt like I was gonna die. So my teacher wanted me transported to the ER My EKG came back normal sinus tachycardia fast heart rate. They pulled labs and everything was normal except for low magnesium and potassium. They gave me some fluids and discharged me. For the next few days my heart rate was a constant 120 even when resting and my anxiety was through the roof! It sucked! My doctor then prescribed me Lexapro and man oh man hats of to anyone that could get through that first phase of Lexapro. It trashed me constant panic attacks SOB tingling the whole 9 yards. I stopped after 5 days due to the fact that I didn't want to be tied to a pill at such a young age. Since my panic attack Ive had constant anxiety. Im having anxiety about things Ive never worried about before! it sucks! Its like I have to experience all these things over again like driving to tell myself there is nothing to be anxious about. Ill also be sitting in the most comfortable place in my house not stressed at all then my heart rate will kick off to the 120s for the whole day. Do you guys experience this? I also feel like I'm having heart palpitations. It feels like my heart is in my throat and I can't catch my breath. It sucks! Every time I stand up my heart rate jumps. It takes a long time for me to calm down and convince myself I'm not dying. I know my case is minor to some cases Ive read but damn Im having a hard time with this. Im in constant fear and anxious about having another anxiety attack and passing out. Im trying everything I can before I commit to an antidepressant. Im trying L theanine Ashwagandha and magnesium. I got prescribed adarax but it doesn't seem to help like ativan does. I just want my old life back. Is this normal? Does it get better? will it be like this forever? how did you guys get over your anxiety? tips? medications? Thank you all for taking time and reading my post I really appreciate it. I just really need some help...,Anxiety

52884,Terrified of going to the dentist I know I have some cavities because I went to the dentist sometime last year and they scheduled an appointment for fillings but when I showed up no one was there and they wouldn't answer my calls for months so I gave up. But tonight I was looking at my teeth and I'm pretty sure I see one. I don't see any actual black or decay just an indent that was hiding behind some tartar but everyone's always told me that once you can see a cavity it's already too far and the tooth usually needs to be pulled might not be true just what I've been told I'm hopefully going to make an appointment on Monday but I'm so nervous because my teeth are terrible. I don't have any missing or rotting teeth but I can never remember to brush them and I had hg a couple years ago that turned into a 3 year long problem of throwing up multiple times a day. So they're yellow have a ton of build up and I'm pretty sure they told me I have gum disease at my last appointment. I'm so worried they're going to judge me and think I'm disgusting. I'm also terrified of getting fillings because the numbing shots never work fully for me so it's always super painful. I checked their website and it says that they offer nitrous conscious sedation and iv sedation but I'm not even sure my insurance will pay for unnecessary sedation since nitrous makes me freak out. And then how would I ask for it without sounding like a drug seeker?? I'm sorry if this seems like rambling. I'm just freaking out.,Anxiety

After some time he layed in it had my plushies in his arm the blanked over him and the pillows under his head and I just wanted to scream. I still feel so uncomfortable.

He also changed the position of my bedtable And I feel like ripping my skin of I can't stand the feeling and goddamn HE HAD SCHOOL CLOTHES ON. And went in. My. Bed. I changed the sheets not a while ago and they were all clean and now not. I don't even allow myself to lay in my bed with dirty clothes. I need to shower put on fresh clothes and then I can lay in my bed. I had the problem of people just simply touching anything in my bed since I was little They always bullyed me and extra jump on it ect. I always cried because of it and It still didnt change. I'm so sensitive about anyone on my bed I even feel disgusted if my mom sits on it just a tiny bit. There is no excuse everyone I know makes me uncomfortable when beeing on my bed.

My anxiety sucks so bad. I feel like most days it controls who i am and what i act like for that day. Today i went out with my friends and we had a good time but we ended up being outside a lot longer than we would and i got extremely cold and started panicking. We were far from everyones house and all i wanted was to go home. They came to my house afterwards and it was nice for a while but i was still feeling anxious. When they all left i felt immediately better like this huge weight on my chest being lifted off. its not that i dont like my friends but being around people is so exhausting. I hate that im like this i just wanna feel normal so bad. I get anxious so easily and it wont go away for hours. Then when im not feeling anxious i feel depressed. It constantly feels like a never ending storm or something. Like just when it starts to feel bright and the rain might stop it starts again and gets so dark. Im constantly fighting just to stay sane and its so hard. All i want is to feel normal and okay and maybe real because im constantly dissociating. I do have a therapist btw,Anxiety

From January I was in a decent headspace with it but the last three weeks it's got worse and then the last four days or so it's gone off a cliff. It's all I think about all day long I had panic attacks on Monday and Wednesday and my heart is racing all day. Where before I'd wake up rested now I wake up with my heart racing and frequently my muscles are spasming which is scary. The thought of doing normal stuff feels impossible and I can't shake this feeling I can't get better than this ever again. I spoke to my doctor on Thursday and he prescribed propranolol which I took yesterday for the first time which helped with the body stuff but my mind was still racing.Has anyone experienced similar and have any tips? I feel like this is really really bad and worse than most people have anxiety.,Anxiety

52897,Overwhelmed tried struggling I was diagnosed with an otherspecified anxiety disorder for about a year now and that sent me into a tailspin during my diagnosis. I was doing therapy consistently since then and felt like I had a handle on things but was triggered into another episode a month ago.I just feel disconnected and kind of dead now. I've had on and off anxiety the whole month it's affected my relationship I'm exhausted all the time struggling also with stomach issues and feel like I'm barely keeping my head above water. My partner has tried to be supportive but I can tell it wears him down. I can't see how I can keep doing this and feeling like this forever. I don't even know what I'm looking for from this post but I just wanted to write something out because I feel tired and sad and alone.,Anxiety

52908,Have my body forgotten how to breath properly? I have a constant feeling of tightness in my chest.No matter how i breathe i can never take a breath that feels relaxing and satisfying.Sometimes when i don't pay attention to my breathing i subconsciously hold my breath for a few seconds only to gasp for air a few moments later.Most of the time my breathing is shallow and irregular.A lifetime of anxiety and the associated sensation of having a hard time breathing makes me believe my nervous system have forgotten how to breath properly. Can anyone relate?,Anxiety
52909,Anxiety stopping me from working Ive been dealing with anxiety for a while now I came to the realisation a few years ago that it has mainly stemmed from the relationship with my dad I had when I was younger. This is caused me to not be able to do tasks in front of people wether they be simple or not I just cant do it. I start lightly trembling and thinking about how stupid I must look to whoever is watching me this causes me to mess up even more. This is really stopped me from wanting to go out and get a job because I know that if the interview goes well I actually do good in interviews weirdly then I will eventually have to be shadowed and critiqued by someone while I learn the job. This dread has stopped me from going to 3 interviews now. Does anyone else get this? Sorry for the long post.,Anxiety
52910,Dry heaving Ive been dealing with a really complex personal issue involving heartbreak loss of a person I deeply care about certainly the worst pain Ive experienced in my life thus far. As it stands I already carry a level of anxiety with me but with this added on to it my body has been putting me through hell. I find myself dry heaving hard in the mornings especially and then at times throughout the day. This has led to some really painful vomiting on several occasions. Its also occurred at my workplace the gym and several other public places without warning. I know theres absolutely a psychosomatic part of all of this but after almost three weeks its becoming really problematic for me. Has anyone experienced something similar? Is this just something I have to power through? Are there any tricks to at least minimize it?,Anxiety

52912,Where do I begin to get help? I'm a 27 year old female. I've probably had anxiety all my life but have never spoken to a doctor or anyone about it. I feel like im just always in a constant state of worry. So much so that it drives me to have small OCD traits. Something as simple as fearing a house fire and having to do a series of steps checking lights before I leave the house. Over and over......and over again. It's weird. I'm always worrying about the future past things I can't change things I say or do after im with people how people view me if I have a too much gene. I'll sit and agonize over things that's so mild for someone to worry about but drives me up a wall. To the point of frustration where I just lose it and cry into a panic. I dont even know where to start to solve this. I feel like the past year it's been horrendous and getting increasingly worse. I'm good at playing it off. I'm good at putting on a show because I've always thought I could handle it lots of people I know feel the same. But it's really starting to take a toll on my life and the things I'm doing or too afraid to even try to do.I feel like I use alcohol and drugs as a way to cope sometimes. Not an outrageous amount but I'll have a big drinking night and then will go a week without drinking cause I've worried myself into thinking I have a problem and need self control. I'm so good at people pleasing and acting like everything is fine but I feel like my mind is just in a dark place. Telling myself I'll never make it that I'll always be alone etc.It's really stupid things to stress over. Or at least stupid things to let myself worry about for more than a minute. Money is always a bug stress factor for everyone of course but thats the main reason I think I've never gone to get help. I'm not sure how much it cost to afford the help I need or where to even go. Not to mention the fear I get trying to explain how I feel to someone and them thinking I'm crazy or I'm making it up how sad to think a professional in this field would judge me....I just feel like if I dont try to improve my overall mindset towards life then I wont have a fulfilling one. I'll be too afraid to try new things that scare me I'll stick to my same safe routine and I'll come home and cry over the big and small worries that run through my head daily. Where I do I start to fix this...?,Anxiety
52913,People often say Really? when I tell them I have anxiety and I have mixed emotions about it. On the one hand its comforting to know that all of my worries about coming across as nervous or awkward are so out of proportion that people dont even know I have anxiety. On the other hand it feels sort of invalidating to my struggle if that makes sense. This thing often consumes my life and its frustrating that no one knows how hard Im trying. They just think this is easy for me that I can effortlessly raise my hand and speak in class like other people do. Thats not to say that I feel negatively toward the people who say this more that its just generally frustrating that people have no idea. Have yall thought about this too? Do you look at it a different way?,Anxiety

52915,Im dating someone I really like and its absolutely killing me A bit of background I was diagnosed with ocd and gad about 15 years ago. Been very much under control for the most part. Im 32 years old and just started dating an incredible 31 year old woman about a month ago. Ive dated a lot over the past few years but this is the first time in ages where Ive REALLY been into the person. Normally it feels like the people I date like me more than I like them and anxiety doesnt play a role. I just go about my day with a calm mind and do what needs to be done. But now it feels like the roles are reversed and Im getting crushed. Constant thoughts of whether or not she likes me obsessing over every word in her texts to try interpreting meaning freaking out if shes doesnt respond to my messages within a couple hours. Its taking over my life. My work is slipping I cant sleep well a constant awful sick panicked feeling in the pit of my stomach. It doesnt help that shes very reticent with her emotions and does not offer much words of affection or validation. But I dont want to scare her off with my intense feelings so on the surface Ive been playing it cool the best I can. I almost wish she would just end things with me so I could move on because not knowing how she feels is the worst part.I dont know what to do.,Anxiety
52916,Try to massage the back of your head with your palm and then concentrate on feeling it and imagine that you are thinking your thoughts and feeling feelings there. This technique helped me to develop awareness of my thoughts and feelings as observer. Also it helped me to heal my anxiety and neurosis. I call this Back of head method. I hope you try it and it works.If your attempt was successful and you started feeling calmness and ease i recommend you to regularly practice this method for months to get good results. You wont even recognize your reaction to impulses after long practice.,Anxiety

52918,Im Afraid My Mom Might Hurt Me So the preface Im someone in my early twenties living with my parents. My parents have been fighting for years occasionally physically. This would usually include my mom knocking in my dads door to argue with him. These arguments would usually start with topics that included bills taxes or myself that would eventually escalate to more personal matters I will not get into too much here. I used to try to intervene when things got too heated since they cant stop themselves but recently I have decided not to so anymore as the last time I tried to intervene my mom did physically attack me I didnt get hurt I was just standing in front of my dad and she lurched at me.Last night she called me to ask if I could knock on my dads door since he wasnt responding to her calls because she needed to pay a bill. I knew that this wasnt just about a bill so I compromised and sent him a text instead I even sent her a screenshot as proof. And I wasnt going to call himwake him up in the middle of the night unless it was an emergency as I would consider it to be rude to do so. She then says dont worry your little head about go back to sleep or whatever okay? Then she called me again this time saying What are the consequences gonna be? Knock on the fucking door. I declined saying I dont want to be a part of whatever was going on between them and she should talk to him about this to which she said I know. Hes your loving dad and Im the evil mom. I said goodnight to her she laughs and responded with not goodnight. Good bye. I say that I will talk to her tomorrow and she replies Ill never talk to you again. Not tomorrow not the next day or the next.She then calls me twice then immediately hangs up. She calls me one more time that night here are the things she said when I declined to knock on my dads door againI ask you to do one simple thing and you didnt do it. Its just a simple thing! I tried calling your dad and he isnt answering me. Its not like youre picking sides or anything! Translation Look at what I do for you! And yet you cant this simple task for me? Well then I will rescind my love for you!Its not like youre picking sides or anything!Youre full of shit just like him my dad.Where has your dad been all of your life?You need to take responsibility.Is this what one of your councilors told you to say the one that I pay x amount of money I dont exactly remember.You dont even know what is going on.But fine. You can do whatever go to sleep wake up in the morning do whatever you do.Me ok. Goodnight mom.And finally I said goodnight to her and she said Dont call me mom. Just say good night.Thats not to say my dads innocent either or anything hes hella toxic and has treated my mom poorly as well so it is hard to tell where the abuse and victimization starts and ends between the two of them. Basically theyre both each others abusers and victims if that makes any sense at all. But I do believe he is the safer parent as although he can at his worst make me feel very uncomfortable to be around him as he is kind of an asshole at times I dont feel like my safety is threatened around him unlike with my mom. Hes a lesser of two evils if you will.So I just feel really anxious right now. I did not want to be used as a pawn against dad and my mom immediately associated me with him. So now Im afraid that when she comes home she will start to treat exactly like she treats dad or worse. Im afraid she might start pounding my door and attacking verbally and physically. Okay that is all I just needed to vent. Thank you for reading this.,Anxiety
52919,Something is wrong with me... Trigger warning I'm becoming numb and I don't feel like talking to anyone. I'm not diagnosed with anxiety but I know I have it. Even being aware I don't feel better. It sucks. I'm a good person. I don't say that a lot but I am. Why is this happening to me? Overthinking every stupid thing nailbiting the constant hatred for myself and others. It doesn't help. As a kid I've always known that something is wrong with me. But I'm too scared to tell my parents because if it's confirmed it means I'm sick. I am not okay and I want help. But I'm so used to being the person who helps not being helped. I always put on a fake smile and am never in a bad mood no one suspects it.I feel so alone. I should be used to it but ever since I've got friends I want to spend time with them. It doesn't help because we have a huge fight and I keep overthinking it. I wanted to feel better because I somehow convince myself my feelings are fake and that I'm doing it for attention. So I took a pathology test and the result was too much for me. The questions felt so attacking and my stomach hurt every time I clicked a yes or a no. The result was that it is 90 sure I have anxiety. My stomach dropped seeing that. While I was happy I was right at some point I felt retarded. That realization that is actually something wrong with me was horrifying. I don't mean to degrade anyone but I felt horrible.,Anxiety

52924,Scared to ask mom for things because of judgement Ok so kinda a weird post and Im not sure if it belongs here but I figured this sub was probably the best one for it. I also tried the social anxiety sub but my post was instantly removed. So basically I have this huge fear of asking my mom for things because I think she will judge me for them. I dont have this fear around anyone else I couldnt care less what anyone else thinks of me but for some reason I have it with her. Im not talking about little things like asking for something at the store or asking for basically any necessity. Im talking about bigger things like hair dye piercings or really anything to do with clothing. For example recently I worked up the confident to ask her over text if I could dye my hair which she is fine with however later that day when she asked me to show her pictures of what I want I chickened out and got to scared to show her. Its like I knew she would say yes but I was still to scared to show her because I was afraid shed say something judgmental to me. She has always been sorta judgmental towards me but I really want to get over this fear because it prevents me from getting a lot of the things I really want. Is there anything I can do?,Anxiety
52925,I had a mini win ! Hello everyone I hope youre okay. I was just playing FIFA and boom a big palpitation hit I started to panic felt lightheaded because I was holding my breath because I was so tense and then calmed down. I have had my heart checked 7 times 2 of which are private best testing ones and its perfect so I know its not going to harm me but still catches me off guard I think its more of the fact I was leaning forward that it felt harder and the fact I was breathing in lol. Anyway ! I was laying in bed thinking I need to just once and for all get over all of the symptoms that are making me scared of being Ill and dying. How can I do that ???? GET OVER MY FEAR OF DYING now Im not saying Im perfectly fine with death because I am not but I just thought to myself I cant stop death and I just need to accept it. If there isnt a god I wont know about dying after if there is a God I could go to heaven which is great and who knows I could reincarnate and live life again. We dont know so its the anxiety of not knowing which scares me and leaving my family behind. Like I say Im a healthy 22 year old male with NO health conditions death can happen at anytime and could happen the next minute but for my age and health it is unlikely but never zero. Now Im religious and I am sort of anxious in my mind that God is trying to get me to accept death so I can die soon lol but I dont wanna die soon thats why Im scared off. Thats just my anxious mind thinking right ? I guess the positive way of looking at it is that God is getting me to get over my fear of death so I can live the LONG HAPPY HEALTHY LIFE that he put out for me. Can anyone help me accept death even more ?,Anxiety

52927,27 yo with severe anxiety living with parents fails at life Hey ranxiety I am in a very tough spot rn i was working towards becoming a teacher for 7 years started my teaching certification programme in my country you need to do this but after 3 weeks I was so anxious of all the people i constantly had to deal with that i started suffering from constant belly pain diarrhea insomnia. So after spending 4 weeks on sick leave i decided i want to quit and try to focus on my mental health first and maybe find a small job like a 10 h job in order to be slowly introduced into regular work life while getting support from therapy and social services the 10 h job idea was from my therapist because i havent had a job except for a summer job when i was 18 which was very traumatic because the boss constantly berated me made fun of me and humiliated me.I still live with my parents who have financially supported me throughout my studies tho till i was 25 my health insurance was free and they got tax benefits and child benefits from me still living with them if i had moved out i would have been entitled to support by them my divorced father had to pay me 112 a month for instance and to them me quitting because i just can't work with children and a ton of colleagues and the constant stress of being judged and evaluated and dealing with maladjusted kids supposedly is understandable. However they demand of me to immediately get a fulltime or 30 hour job so i can move out ASAP in potentially a field i have little experience in and they say i shouldnt become unemployed and rely on social services because it would look bad on my CV.Because i was struggling to find a field that would interest me within a week of deciding to quit teaching and me offering to apply for a 10 h job at a library smth i wanted to do before but my applications failed sadly as a transitionary period my mother basically screamed daily at me the last couple days saying i should get a job and gtfo and stop acting like a child when i started crying shaking and feeling like i was about to throw up. She says she is entitled to her financial support paying off after all this time and that i should get a job like a normal person and support myself. As a result of this constant yelling and screaming and ranting i havent been able to sleep for days i have lost 3 kg of weight lack any appetite have to get up every night cus of diarrhea and havent slept more than 3 hours most nights. Yday i proposed the idea with the 10 hour job and my mother reacted as if i was telling her a bad joke and said i should be ashamed for even suggesting such a thing. In her rage she said i should gtfo she doesnt care if it's social housing or a homeless shelter and that she didnt financially support me to become a workshy leech. So in my panic i phoned a bunch of social services just in case so i would know my options. Today she came in tears to me and said she was just very concerned about my future. Yday I talked to my doctor and my therapist about the potentiality of getting kicked out and they asked if i could go somewhere to get away from this situation so i can recover a bit like i was supposed to during my sick leave so i decided today to leave for my boyfriend's place who is still a student and also lives with his parents but in a different country we are in EU so travelling is no problem. I have some money left from my teaching job that i could give them if they ask for it i was paying my fam 250 a month from the teacher pay so i wouldnt be freeloading while i stay there. I have been taking Sertraline Zoloft for a few weeks now but have had very little success. I have been in therapy since november and been on sick leave since late february. I think if i had stayed i would have become suicidal as i was noticing myself starting to go numb and dissociate whenever i was being yelled at. After explaining my situation to my doctor she said she couldnt let me leave without asking if i have sucidial thoughts because in that case she would have recommended sending me to a clinic.Some questions are plagueing me now however... am i a coward? Am i doing the right thing? Am i a lazy leech like my parents call me or just too mentally ill to work a proper job for now?What do you guys think about my situation am i doing the right thing? What should i have done in your opinion? Kind of asking as a reality check,Anxiety

Ik people typically associate this with dissociation but I still feel in control and recognize and Im mindful of the fact that I am the one controlling my movements but idk its hard to explain it just feels like a lack of connection between the two and at certain times its so bad I feel Im just going to lose control of my body completely. Ive also been experiencing some feelings of being off balance muscle tension headaches RLS and brain fog and Im starting to wonder if my fears really are anxiety or something worse. I saw a doctor and she told me it is probably stress related but Im just having a hard time with all of this Im seeing neurologist later this month but I just feel so restless and like Im living in agony and losing my mind I wanted to see if anyone has gone through something similar and can offer any advice Thanks.,Anxiety
52930,Am I being too hard on myself? I'm putting myself through a university undergraduate degree as a mature student 25 and I just had my grades improve over the last two semesters. But this semester... My father in law had emergency surgery in January. I got approved for breast reduction surgery in February and had it done March 21st this past Tuesday and now I have to drop 1 course out of 3 because I'm failing it and can't keep up it's an elective that's not in my field of study.I think the stress of that course will jeprodize my recovery but my stress isn't gone. Due to my Fs in that course I'm second guessing myself. I have an interview this coming Tuesday to be a research assistant and have to submit a writing sample and I feel inadequate. Even though I get really high marks on my papers in my field. I feel like I'm not allowed to be proud of myself. To be optimistic or excited. I feel like I have to be hard on myself instead of encouraging. I sound delusional asking if I'm being too hard on myself because I know the answer... But I can't let myself believe it.,Anxiety

More so when I think about it. Ive gotten an EKG done a few days ago and it came back normal so I guess that helps ease my mind a little bit.

52933,New to this. Need coping skills Hello I am new to this community but I wanted some help. Ill start with some context. Ive always been a person that throws up and a lot of the time it was when I was nervous. This past year tho it has gotten much worse with a time where I even went to the hospital because I hadnt eaten in like 2 days and I felt so physically exhausted and dehydrated. At first I thought it was from weed and something called CHS but quitting weed didnt really make a difference. I also have delt with this vommiting in highschool before I would go to a party I would get so nervous I would puke. And that was before I ever touched weed.This led me to go to a gastro doctor who said he did not think it was weed related and instead some inflammation in intestines. Ive been on meds for that for 3 months but it was getting better and I really started to take my anxiety seriously so I went to my doctor and they prescribed me an SSRI. I also will start therapy in a few weeks here. For the past month after about 1.5 month on SSRI I have been doing better. I hadnt thrown up for a month but these past 2 nights I have had very panic attack like feelings and tonight even pushed me to the point where I had to get up from being comforted by my girlfriend to throw up. And I always feel awful about it and like its going to just keep happening and I think I get stuck in that cycle.Does anyone have any tipsadvice on dealing with this before my therapy appointment I thought I was doing so good but now Im afraid Im slipping back.,Anxiety

Its gotten so bad that I barely leave the house and Im afraid to exert myself which is depressing because I used to be a gym rat and exercising was what I used to do help cope with my anxiety but thats not something I can do anymore Atleast In my mind I cant. This has really intensified over this past year after dealing with multiple panic attacks that have landed me in the ER and Ive been getting a bunch of physical symptoms constantly that does not help with my worrying. Ive had many tests done and the doctors are very reassured that Im healthy. My Doc believes the Lexapro will help me but I cant seem to find the courage to take it. Im just so terrified of it Id really appreciate some encouragement to start my meds because I high key hate living like this .,Anxiety

I started having panic attacks where my heart rate would spike to 150180. I went to my doctor in case it wasnt anxiety and just had my Holter Monitor results come back. I had one of these attacks while on it and thankfully no dangerous rhythms were found. Just some high rates but not sustained so my doctor is unconcerned. So once again this is all anxiety. My therapist thinks its because I started a new job last month and Im falling back into my old health anxiety habits because Stress compounds symptoms. This has gotten so bad that the past week I havent even been able to leave my bed out of fear of my heart getting too high. Due to probably the fear when I cooked or did dishes my heart rate could get up to 130 then if I noticed and began to worry it went up to 160.Now that I know Im fine I thought Id be okay but Im still constantly watching my smart watch to see how high my heart rate gets then panicking when I see it go above 120 from just walking around the house but when Im calm it doesnt go over like 110. This happened on the Holter and it was normal. I know this is just anxiety but I cant stop obsessing that I have a heart issue thatll kill me. I just need help to take the smart watch off and stop taking my blood pressure. Its just making everything worse. Yesterday alone according to my logs I took my blood pressure 50 times. I was worried because my bp was low when standing yet my heart rate was high so I thought it was dangerous. It happened again this morning and my heart rate got to 165. This constant checking is driving me crazy and ruining my life. How do I stop this??,Anxiety

52941,Health anxiety i've noticed that over the last year i've become super anxious when it comes mine and my loved ones health i think it's because my husband had bells palsy early last year. Since then anything will trigger me!! literally anything. I was picking at a mole didnt realize and it started bleeding and got itchy and now I have this anxious feeling in my stomach even tho i know IM the one who picked at it. I feel like even though my brain is like yes u picked at u probably dont have anything to worry about that anxious feeling in my stomach is still there.Other times if i have a headache it goes to the worst outcome. I make doc appts every so often but I also don't want to be that person who shows up so frequently for nothing and waste my docs time. Im really starting to feel hopeless and like Im going to live with this anxious feeling forever. I guess.. any advice?,Anxiety
52942,is it normal for an SSRI to make you feel like you're literally dying I was prescribed 50 mg Zoloft for anxiety and depression which I took for the first time last night. What followed was the most excruciatingly painful and unbearable 12 hours of my life. I threw up anything I ate heart was pounding nonstop my entire body was numb and I couldn't sleep without being constantly woken up by stomach pain or nausea. Pretty much all the anxiety symptoms I normally get except all at once and multiplied 100x. At certain points I honestly felt like I was about to die or pass out.I know people say that it gets worse before it gets better but nothing could have prepared me for this. I don't think I'm gonna take another dose until I can talk with my psychiatrist and be absolutely certain this won't happen again. Anyone else have a similar experience or am I just really fucking unlucky,Anxiety
52943,I am feeling anxious about a new coworker. TW Past experience with a stalker briefly mentioned I'm sorry but this is a long one. It's a bit of a weird story but I'm hoping that someone might be able to give me advice on what to do. Just over a month ago I female cashier got a new coworker male bagger at the grocery store I work at. It took a while before we had a conversation together he was helping me and asked me what kind of music I like. I was honest and said that I like most genres and that I sometimes enjoyed listening to 20s and 30s jazz music. Then he just kept talking about old music at me for the next few days and seemed to always be distracted when it came to work. I don't like to talk much while I'm working because I feel like I mess up more when I do. So I began to feel anxious about being around him since I didn't know how to tell him I didn't want the conversation to continue every time we saw each other.Then a few days ago he randomly asked me for my number in front of a bunch of customers while we were supposed to be working. I had a bad experience the last time I gave my number out to someone the guy turned out to be a stalker who harassed me for weeks and told everyone that we were in a relationship when we weren't wouldn't stop calling me tried to turn me against my family etc. and I immediately felt freaked out about why this guy would want my number when we don't know each other at all. It felt really inappropriate and unprofessional to me. I told him that we were busy and shouldn't be having that conversation right then mainly because I didn't know how to say no in the moment and that we could talk when we were done helping customers. But he continued to ask me repeatedly for throughout the next hour or so. He ended up writing his number down at some point and gave it to me telling me when he was off that day and to immediately text him my number when he was off this is while I was talking to a customer. Once we were done with all of the customers I told him the truth that I didn't want to give him my number and how I had had bad experiences in the past that started with giving my number to a guy I barely knew. He seemed to understand and then avoided me the rest of the day. So I thought everything was going to be fine.However the next day I started noticing that he seemed to be getting more clingy with me. He wouldn't be focused on doing his job and would stick around me as much as possible. He has a habit of sticking to my register instead of helping other cashiers like he's supposed to he also seems to get bothered if another bagger is helping me and he tries to take over bagging for me immediately. I often notice him watching me from across the room. Every conversation we have is awkward. I don't initiate them because I want him to leave me alone so I can work. When he's not talking to me it seems like he isn't really talking to our other coworkers that much.But then the other day I had a bit of a scary experience. I was going on break and went to our break room. He was in there and had headphones in so I didn't think he saw me. After a few minutes I went to the bathroom across the hall. When I came out a few minutes later the room was empty. I suddenly hear loud footsteps running down the hall and he barges into the room halfyelling my name just to show me a song from the 1800s for some reason. I'm worried that he might have been waiting outside the bathroom for me which makes me kind of scared to be at work right now. I don't like being alone with him. Today I spent the majority of my breaks hiding in the bathroom worried he might bother me if I went anywhere else.I know that the anxiety I feel isn't healthy and I can't tell if I'm just paranoid from past experience or if there really could be a real issue here. I don't know if I should talk to him a manager or HR about this. I thought that maybe I should just say nothing and act less nice to him and see if he leaves me alone but I'm worried that it could just make things worse. I could really use some advice if anyone has some. Because I really can't tell if he's just trying to be friendly and doesn't realize he's making me uncomfortable or if there is something potentially more creepy going on.,Anxiety
52944,I am having a extremely large amounts of anxiety for a person. I 17F am in my senior year of high school. Ive sort of always been anxious especially about people. Any time ANYTHING happens to someone I care about even a little bit I get such bad anxiety that I am often unable to focus on other things. So as I said in high school. When I first started high school life was a mess. Whats important to know is that I had just made a massive transition and had come out of the closet. Not a lot of support from family but thats okay.In my particular HS we have a home room class and you have that teacher for home room for all 4 years. When I met my home room teacher she was incredibly kind. For all 4 years she continued to be this way. She made cards for everyone birthday talked to me when I was rejected romantically for the first time and always listened. We talked to each other while getting ready for the day nearly every day for the last two years. This week shes been absent. Very strange. Then on Wednesday she says in a slide prepared for the sub that shes out on medical leave for the next few weeks. It wasnt planned you could tell from the way she talked in the slides of the previous days. I find out that shes in the hospital but fine. INSTANTLY Im full of anxiety feeling like my soul was removed from my body. Im just worried like a lot. I KNOW shes fine as far as everyone knows. I also led an effort for a Get Well Soon card being given to her by another teacher shes friends with. I dont really know how to just patiently wait for the 34 weeks until she gets back. Id also like to say that I KNOW shes fine. My brain does not seem to feel the same way especially when Im not actively doing something distracting.TLDR my teacher is sick and in the hospital and I have a strangely large amount of anxiety even though everyone says shes fine.,Anxiety

52946,I am sad that a teenager blocked me from viewing his story. I 23F have a pretty okay relationship with my boyfriend's 24M family. His mom is a devote Christian and her and I are pretty close and his brother let's call him Jake and I are okay as well.ampx200BI follow the little brother who is 16 on Instagram and we occasionally interact liking stories picsetc. Yesterday I remembered that my friends and I created a 'burner' account 3 years ago that we used to look and follow people we didn't know crazy I know. ampx200BAnyways I noticed that Jake was following this burner. I looked at his profile as saw a bunch of stuff posted that I have never seen before. It was typical teenage boy stuff like rap music middle fingers in pictures etc. but nothing that I haven't seen before. I realized that I was blocked from viewing these stories and unblocked whenever he posted other stuff. I instantly started to feel sick and uneasy at the thought him blocking and unblocking me each time. I even felt a little teary. I thought does he think I am uncool? Old? Did he think I was going to tell his mom? I also post things with cursing etc. so I really felt confused. I know in reality it is really not that deep because I too have older adults in my life 'blocked' from viewing my story but the feeling I felt was uncontrollable. I don't want to feel like this anymore. I have felt similar to this in other occasions and another user asked if I had rejection sensitive dysphoria. I am not sure if I do. ampx200BTLDR Boyfriend's little brother blocked me from viewing his story and I instantly started to feel uneasy.,Anxiety

52948,College Student w Anxiety Dating Life I first developed severe anxiety and panic disorder in my senior year of high school. I can proudly say that with perseverance proper medication and the help of my lovely therapist family and friends I was able to complete my senior year and begin college in the fall. Ive taken a liking to this guy in my class and we will hang out this weekend. I am very inexperienced in the dating world as Ive only really gone out with three guys ever none of which lasted more than a few months. Though I had not been diagnosed with anxiety in my sophomore year of high school I began dating this guy whom I was pretty infatuated with. However the first time he put his arm around me I shook uncontrollably. I misread that as a sign that he wasnt suitable for me when it was just anxiety. Fast forward to now I am anxious about seeing this guy this weekend and I am scared that these feelings of fear wont go away even if we continue to see each other. Has anyone else been through this? What should I do? I dont want to be limited from dating but l my body is giving me unclear signals of what to do.,Anxiety

52950,Oh anxiety you are weird sometimes. 6 to 7 years ago I was diagnosed with GADPTSD. 2 years ago I was diagnosed with adhd. I have managed it all this time with no medicine and I have been fine with for the most part. The only time my anxiety would rise a little bit is when it was triggered by stress. Which then I knew I just had to balance it out again.Well this month ended up with heighten anxiety due to an allergic reaction being around seafood one week later got a tooth pulled 2 days later I was fussed at by an ER doctor and then one week later after that I had anxiety reflux kick back so hard that it cause two days of back to back panic attacks. My anxiety was so bad that I couldnt eat anything but rice and chicken no meds and being around doctors frighten me. I couldnt manage to get myself out of that anxiety loop. Well I was finally about to get some hydroxyzine for as needed dosage 3 weeks later. My anxiety was down back to a manageable level but my fears were still there. I took one 25 mg pill in the evening. I got an euphoria feeling and drowsiness the whole next day along with diarrhea. Then all my anxiety was gone. I can eat food again without fear. Im not scared to take meds again. This is the weirdest Anxiety is the moment I have ever dealt with. However Im now pondering if with my anxiety reflux being kicked up it had my stomach and brain a relay lap so when I took the hydroxyzine it suppressed that nerve in my stomach and it help my stomach feel better and then which stop the relay cycle. I guess that is something I will have to remember to ask my doctor.,Anxiety
52951,Health anxiety Zoloft side effects? I went off anxiety medication 8 months ago. Cut it cold turkey by accident I was never told otherwise. Thankfully had no withdrawals or anything. I have severe severe severe health anxiety and I was doing really good up until a few months ago it started to get bad again but I was managing. However the past 2 weeks have been really really hard with my health anxiety and I knew I needed to finally get back on and Im so happy to be back on. I had some stomach issues and Im freaking out. I had blood in my stools and bad pains in my pelvis. I also for the past 2 months have had a dull ache in my upper left abdomen. Had some blood and stool tests and all was good. Today is day 2 is taking my medication Zoloft and I have a weird nauseating feeling in my throatchest. It feels exactly like when you get super giddy and your chestthroat squeals with excitement. But I dont feel excited I feel so anxious. Its almost like I have to gag or dry heave. Can the Zoloft be causing this? I had no side effects last time I was on it so its weird. My anxiety is going crazy because Im afraid it has to do with my other symptoms.,Anxiety

52954,Actually you're a total badass Most people are mentally and emotionally sane relatively at least. They might claim that the worry is all in your head not understanding that your corporeal experience strongly suggests otherwise. They might tell you to think positive because they don't have an inner voice that constantly gets drowned out by a huge stadium packed with negative objectors. They might take it rather personally when socializing is the very least thing you want to do they could never imagine that them yapping on about their normal life drains your already depleted lifeenergy. Some of them might start all kinds of shit with you because they see you as a weak and opportune victim to unload their own shit towards never realizing they're the real cowards.Some of them might truly want to help you out and tell you get therapy asap then you might see some random bureaucrat person completely devoid of empathy struggling to stay awake while you pour you heart of desperately looking for some kind of assistance. Assistance that usually comes in form of dubious drugs that only work at a hefty price by the way So they advice you to go see some private expensive experts unaware of the fact that your wallets suffers with you. They like to imply that you just chill the f out and relax. Because they don't have that intrusive horrible horrible horrible encompassing joydevouring soulobliterating sucking painful torturous uneasy pit of dread stuck right in their stomach with racing thoughts to boot. Perhaps they'll make sly remarks on how you need to just grow up after all they don't know how's it's like to think like an adult while emotionally reacting like a little fragile child scared to death.They might say go the gym or be physically active and get some endorphins running. To be fair is actually solid advice if you can muster the strength to go there. Off course they have their problems too the difference however is that your problem is you and how that you contaminate every aspect of your life. The point is according to some of 'them' you're just a loser useless lazy afraid a waste of space a failure with nothing to show for in life. They are so much better than you and intentionally or not they make you buy their version of you.However. It's just opinions from judgemental people at the end of the day. I don't want to you to waste any energy on harboring any resentment envy or anger towards anybody they just don't understand. How could they know the truth. Perhaps even you don't the truth about yourself so I'm going to say it just in case.You simply being here and keeping on makes you a tough as nails. A warrior that fights hordes of demons every day. Bravery is defined by the will to face fear you have fear stuffed in your face all the time. You may suffer endless anxiety but you as a matter of fact are courageous by the definition of the word. Doing your best to just keep going that's it. It's not some lofty motivational speech just a cold fact.It may not help you any bit to read this but I for one will not let it be unsaid. Anxiety is bad enough in itself so rather than feeling shame in addition you have earned the right to have pride in yourself. My intention is for you to keep that in mind on your darkest days because I know very well what it's like to suffer anxiety while having your character measured by factors out of your control.,Anxiety
52955,I think Im gonna pass out from anxiety I am absolutely spiraling about some things that happened today and I am very anxious about some things thatll happen in the next months. Today my anxiety has reached its new peak.I am extremely nauseous lightheaded and it feels like theres a thousand butterflies in my chest.It feels like Im about to pass out from anxiety and I dont know how to calm myself down. Ive tried to distract myself but it doesnt work.What can I do??,Anxiety
52956,Is it anxiety and over thinking? Or is it intuition? How to know the difference? My partner has lied to me in the past and now anything that is remotely close to that topic makes me think hes lying. And then I spiral and think I have to check his phone then I think he deleted messages then I need to check his Apple Watch and then I think he may have used another form of contact and I start to feel like maybe Im being illogical and crossing the line. In the moment I feel like nothing can give me relief except for finding solid proof. Im not proud of this behavior. I recently started therapy for my overall anxiety. Unfortunately it is hard to afford to have sessions often enough. Context He lied 1.5 years ago about something relating to a female coworker it was not infidelity. After lying he was able to prove he was telling the truth. I feel 99 confident about it. Since then he lied about about small things like not playing video games while on the phone. Idk I dont want to damage my relationship with this but I also dont want to be lied to again and turn a blind eye. So how can I know if I am acting because of anxiety and overthinking opposed to following intuition and following my gut. My intuition is how I caught his initial lie.,Anxiety
52957,Blood pressureHeartrate First time posting here. For context I suffer with anxiety obviously and also have bipolar and OCD parents. I find myself constantly obsessing over high blood pressure and high BPM. I'm a heavy set guy. I'm trying to be healthier but I have a long way to go on that. Sometimes hours of my day are spent stressing over whether my heart rate is too high and when I do so I find it usually makes it go higher. I hate going to the doctor because of it because I know my BP will be high and I don't want to know how high. Today I had to go to the doctor and ofc it was high but I was also having a panic attack while they were checking it because of the nerves I have around the whole thing and already had to walk 3 miles just to get there. I wasn't even there over my blood pressure. Anyway after the visit I was sobbing and hyperventilating the whole way home. I just don't know what to do. Obviously I have to get it under control but in the meantime I need to find some way not to obsess over it because it keeps triggering panic attacks.,Anxiety

Just wanted to know if how I feel is felt by someone else around the world. Im justtired. And not because of the spring air and everything.

52964,Why can't I believe what the doctors tell me? I 26 M am super frustrated with myself today I had a cardiologist appointment bc I have palpitations sometimes and my heart races randomly when I have acid reflux. The cardiologist did some blood pressurepulse checks to rule out POTS and said I was fine on that front. The EKG came back great and he said my heart was in excellent shape. I even asked him to order a take home monitor for me just for some peace of mind and he was ok with that. I had an echocardiogram done about 1 year ago with a different cardiologist and everything came back great. Now as I get home from the doctor my anxious brain gets to plotting and is now worrying that He didn't order you another echocardiogram what if he's missing something. My rational brain believes and trusts this doctor very much but the anxiety part of my brain just wants to create more worry for any reason it can find. Can anyone give me some advice or insight? Is there even any Medical reason I would need a second echocardiogram 1 year later? I assume it detects defects that have been there probably from birth so a second one is probably pointless but it's hard to tell my anxious brain that. I Just want to believe the doctors when they give me positive news and believe that I'm fine.Edit I should note I am very aware that I have health anxiety and I am currently in therapy for it already It still bugs me though.,Anxiety

52971,Anxiety and Weed Hi looking for a bit of advice and experiences from ranxiety here.Around Christmas I started to develop some kind of anxiety disorder and had a lot of panic attacks. For most of my life I've always been a little anxious and tended to overthink but these symptoms were just much worse. Up to this point I've also been smoking weed but not excessively mostly once a week. After developing said disorder weed now increases my symptoms despite it never doing something like this before and it mostly calming me down. Even when I had a greenout I mainly suffered physical symptoms. In response to my symptoms I started with autogenic training a lot of introspection about my fears and stopped smoking for about a month. With this I got the worst of it under control. Since then I've been smoking a few times with mixed results sometimes I get more anxious and panicky but on other occasions it also felt like a normal high. Right now I still have some lingering symptoms that can be better or worse depending on the day so I'll definitely quit weed until I can resolve this. My question now is if any of you here have suffered something similar and were you eventually able to smoke without getting anxious again? I'll be honest I quit enjoyed being high so that would be quite the bummer but certainly not the end of the world.Thanks in advance!,Anxiety

52975,Anticipatory anxiety ruined my chance at a vacation. I'm so tired of trying to fly and failing. 28M.I've had a lifelong fear of flying that feel wellprepared to take headon especially the fear I've had around taxiing and takeoff. I've flown before but it's gotten harder to get through the process without running out of the airport dizzy panicked and overwhelmed by guilt in the past few years.Specifically I took a program called SOAR designed to help fearful flyers manage their fightflight responses around takeoff and aviophobia or fears when the plane is in the air. I felt confident in the last few weeks that I could do this. But as I lay on my side writing this I realize I was completely unprepared for the anticipatory anxiety ahead of the flight.I woke up at 4 am this morning in a cold sweat. My extremities were numb. I couldn't get a 10minute patch of sleep in without my stomach seemingly twisting into knots. The last 17 hours has been a waking nightmare of existing in a moderate to strong panic attack state. My appetite is nonexistent. I'm barely able to drink water. Every nerve in my body is screaming at me to tell my friends that I can't go on the spring break trip we planned.It's crazy I'm a grad student and I have never felt as tired as I do now just spending this day holding myself back from tears and a full breakdown. I'm so tired that a beach doesn't sound nice right now. I just want to curl up in my bedroom with no direct sunlight to sleep to cry to indulge in selfhatred for having a response this extreme to something so commonplace in life for a lot of people. A vacation is the one thing I need right now but trying to take one via flying has destroyed me. I'm lucky that I had nothing to do today because it was not going to get done. I don't know if this thread is a message in a bottle but it helps to get it out. If anyone has been in a similar situation I'd love to hear it.I still want to fly deaparately. It's one of the big things keeping me from living my life on my terms. But having to spend almost 48 hours in utter hell is not worth it.,Anxiety
52976,My mom doesnt care anymore I 24M have been dealing with anxiety and treatment resistant depression for the past few years or so. Its gotten very bad and my mental health has deteriorated as the days go on. Ive started struggling with really bad brain fog and confusion and its really freaked me out lately. Ive been unable to work since mid last year and still live with my brother and mom. My dad moved about 30 mins away a year and a half ago after my parents got divorced but they stayed friends.The past few months have been hell dealing with the brain fog on top of the other issues and not being able to find a doctor to take me seriously. Im surely at a loss. My mom has began dating again and is legitimately obsessed with online dating. Buying every membership to every site imaginable talking to a different guy every night and most nights shes going out. Now this probably wouldnt bother me but when I have so much going on sometimes I just need someone to talk to. I was always extremely close to my mom she has always been there for me but lately she really doesnt even seem to care. Her only worry is that Im afraid youre going to hurt yourself but she doesnt want to do anything to help me. She told me this morning that she wants me to go stay with my dad and Im so hurt. Ive lived here for 24 years and I just want to feel clear headed again. Idk what to do and I feel like my parents hate me. I honestly feel like I have nobody.I do go out with friends a lot of nights or just hangout to get out of the house I workout so its not like Im just sitting at home waiting for her. But you cant even have a conversation with her without her staring at her phone. Ive honestly never seen anything like it and I cant imagine losing my parents emotionally. Im at a loss.,Anxiety

52978,Politics has made me anxious again I just want something to finally go right. Hello.So my country is going to have an election in the fall. Politics used to stress me out much more in the past I've since then cut a lot of the sites that were stressing me out and most days I feel pretty good and don't really worry about it that much. My country has been ruled by religious extremists who are incredibly bigoted for eight years now I'm so tired of their constant discriminatory comments blatant disregard for any sort of decency and integrity and they overall just make me so tired and anxious and sad. They've started to rule when I was a teen and I'm a young adult and they're still at the helm. It seems like they will win this year again and another even more extreme religious conservatist party has a chance at becoming the third biggest power.I fell into a mental hole and I can't get out of it. I know that the elections will be in the fall and it's early spring but I just feel so depressed and powerless. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to and that it will always just be horrible. I know that it's my brain making a bigger deal out of it than it should but I'm just so tired of it all can at least one thing go how I want politically?How do you deal with feelings like these?,Anxiety

52980,Are my antidepressants not working? Ive 22F have been on antidepressants since I was 14 but Ive never felt 100 better. I switched from Zoloft to Celexa about 2 years ago and Im currently taking the max dose of Celexa but I still get pretty bad bouts of depression and anxiety at least a couple of times per week. Im in therapy so I know of a variety of coping measures that I can take such as exercise journaling spending time with friendsfamily and breathing techniques but none of those things seem to work. I dont have any major problems or stressors in my life either Im just depressed for no reason 25 days per week.Does this mean that my antidepressants arent working or do I just kinda need to suck it up?

This time I forgot to write down the time I came back from the bathroom they have this paper we have to write when we left and came back from the room. Usually they write the time after we give ID but this time for some reason we had to do it all. I did write down the time I got out but I didnt write down the time I came back left twice and yup forgot twice. Usually we dont have to do this so thats why I forgot. Im worried this might get me in trouble because theres no way they can know the time I actually came back to the exam room ugh I know its dumb but dammit if they notice this it might actually get me in trouble ,Anxiety

52989,Is it AnxietyBurnout and why do my neckbackchest pains haven't stopped ever since august 2022 Disclaimer the post is slightly copy paste from this thread but I want to share this on many threads in order to get some help. I'm M 33years oldWhat's really interesting is every single described on this thread are almost identical to the ones I I have right now so if you can please check them out so you understand what I am going trough.httpswww.reddit.comrcostochondritiscommentsjrihv6chestpainformonthsnoanswers?xpromoedpenabled The only logical explanation I've found myself is that it might be severe Anxiety or Burnout I've experienced which makes my muscles being tense up all the time without me even realising it and get inflamed by the constant stress.As well some people from what I've googled claim that it might be side effect after a COVID infection around June 2022 but oddly enough my wife is totally fine despite both of us having similar symptoms while we were sick I got headaches and my throat hurt her throat hurt and she was tired both of us were 3x vaccinated. The only reason why I rule it out is because these pains did start 2 days after my bed broke down while I was lying on it August 2022 and we changed the bed mattress afterwards around october 2022 but we've slept on the couch that can be transformed into a bed which is literally a wooden plank with the old mattress on top of it that was way overdue had a hole in the middle so had to change it for almost 3 months.Before this all happend I was really really stressed for years because of tons of private issue that negatively impacted my mental health and I was inactive during the lock down 2020 and after losing my job june 2021 I've been almost every day on the PC with bad posture probably from 2019 June 2022. I got now a new job in september 2022 but got laid off from a previous one I was in for 3 months around January 2022Also I was on Amitriptyline 25mg for almost a year and stopped taking them as my neurologist told me back than June 2022 I used to have around 2021 iirc similar painstingles on the left side of my body but not like the ones I have right now.I do really hope if anyone finds out what we can do do finally feel better beside accepting our symptoms and live with them. I have the typical tingly electric feelings around my left side headaches migraines heart races burningcold feeling on one foot or both etc these symptoms typical come when I feel really anxious. Now all the symptoms seems to focus on ChestPainNeck Pain with Brain Fog with especially when the pains are strong.The only relief I've found was lying down tough sometimes I had moment where my back was blockedstiffed but just for a short time and after I moved a bit taking walks outside in the fresh air being distracted doing some stretching of the muscle where I have the pain. Yet what I hate is they all return. I've did the classic health anxiety attack routine going to many Doctors ER etc dozens of Bloodtest came fine have a slight Arthrosis and disc misplacement on my neck nothing seriously according to the doctors Neurologe didn't found any anomaly Cardio doctor in AugustSeptember 2022 told me my heart is totally fine we did a stress test on a bike So in the end I really hope it's just my anxietyburnout as my doctors all say who gave me all these physical symptoms. All I want is that these pains finally stop! And if I did write many confusing things please tell me so I can clear it up. P.S. I wanted to add as well that I grew up with stress my whole life ever since my childhood and that even to this day I am really nervous and my fingers are always tremble I am now asking myself if my body decided to crack when I got into my 30s,Anxiety
52990,Rapid Heart Rate 24M 6 215 pounds I have what I believe to be anxiety disorder. I almost always have some sort of anxiety. Sometimes I feel a little cloudy and maybe even a bit u stable on my feet. The worst is when Ill be working doing something minimally exhausting but my heart rate will raise to over 120 and then the panic ensues. The rapid rate can last hours. Maybe I am a hypochondriac and the more I think and check my pulse the worse it gets. Does anyone else have this happen? I have asked my doctor for a referral to a cardiologist just to be sure. Im currently on no medication.,Anxiety

So today I decided to take it earlier to see if that will help. I took it at noon. I am feeling so awful. Having diarrhea which I guess I dont really care about. But I have a headache and am soooo foggy. Like I feel weird and out of it and so tired but at the same time nervous and amped and I know I wouldnt be able to sleep. Someone please tell me this gets better and its worth it. I cant seem to see the light at the end of the tunnel right now. I have a baby that I have to care for so i hate feeling like this.

52993,Advice greatly needed 26 year old female sorry for the long post Ive been on anti depressants for about the last 12 years of my life. I was always on 100 mg zoloft amp then switched to 20 mg lexapro in 2018 but went off of them for about 6 months in 2021 to try to live without them. At the end of those 6 months I started to get dizzy more often amp have what I can only describe as uncontrollable thoughts. Not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone but I just did not feel in control of my emotions and I felt like I was gonna lose my mind lol amp very depressed. So I got back on lexapro 20 mg amp after a few months I started to feel average at best but better than before. August 2022 I started to get brain zapsdizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start. I worked my way up to 75mg amp started to feel a lottttt better but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since. Very dizzy lots of anxiety amp panic attacks and the weird uncontrollable emotionsthoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since. It gets A LOT worse at night and thats when most of my issues arise.Within the last 6 months Ive seen an ear doctor to make sure I didnt have inner ear issues causing dizziness an eye exam I got a small prescription mostly for being on my phonecomputer or reading and I got an MRI done and saw a neurologist. All has always come back normal so Im thinking its a medication issue or lack of something. Im mostly looking for advice or comfort to make me feel better since Im not doing well lol.

52994,Panic Attacks Hi I've been having very bad anxiety attacks lately. I've been taking valium and it's helped but doesn't eliminate it. I've never had it sooooo bad. I also take olanzapine.

52998,Going to the cinema This is probably a very particular issue and Ive never really wanted to post about my anxiety but Ive led myself here anyway. After a weed induced panic attack about 5 months ago things have been pretty hellish for me. Ive got a painful feeling in my chest I would say the majority of the day anxiety of course every day. Now I love love LOVE films. I plan to go to college next year and study film. Ive wanted to become a director for years now. As youd imagine that requires me to be able to watch pretty much any kind of film whenever. But going to the cinema something I hold so close to my heart as being a place I used to love a place I would go to escape has become really difficult for me. I really struggle in the days leading up to going takes serious mental preparation. Ive been a total of 6 times in 2023 which to people who know me is simply unheard of. Im a big fan of the John Wick films and have plans to go see the 4th one tomorrow. Ive been waiting a long time to see it but I just cant see myself actually going out and seeing it. If youre aware of the John Wick films you know that theyre probably the most foot on the gas and brutal action films around. Which I feel is going to really freak me out. In my experiences of going to the cinema with anxiety Ive never had to leave the cinema. Im pretty uncomfortable being there but Ive never had to leave. I think that the main thing is the fear that this thing I love so much is being taken from me despite me having no evidence to support it. While Ive been able to push myself to go all the other times I just cant see it happening this time. I know its a lot of mental gymnastics but if anyone has ANYTHING to tell me at all Id really appreciate it.Thanks ,Anxiety
52999,The Rollercoaster ride of anxiety.

Even my mouth feels spicy and weird...I don't know is this really something anxiety can do?I don't feel sick at all but everything hurts like i'm in full on flu mode.Pretty much everyone on my mothers side of the family has rheumatism maybe it's finaly breaking out for me?Has anyone else felt like you usually do when you are just completely flu struck only that you aren't actually sick?Today was the first time i took a magnesium supplement 187 mg so maybe it has something to do with that?,Anxiety
53001,Magnesium for anxietyrelated heart palpitations? I have heart palpitations that Ive been to a cardiologist about for years and have always been told theyre just a result of anxiety. I hear of people having heart palpitations during panic attacks or while feeling anxious but I have them all day everyday no matter how calm or regular the moment is. I suppose underlying anxiety is still there as Im a jittery person naturally. But theyre annoying and distracting. I tried a beta blocker but it did absolutely nothing my cardiologist says anxiety meds might help but Im nervous to take any pills I dont have to.I heard magnesium helps with heart palpitations but I know nothing about it how much is good versus bad what form to take it in etc any info is appreciated! Anyone alleviate heart palpitations with magnesium? Id love to hear about your experience.,Anxiety
53002,Is it bad if your antidepressants makes you feel happy I'm not talking about dangerous mood elevation? I'm not talking about mania or hypomania here. But in the past I increased my escitalopram dose a few times. I was really climbing the ladder dosewise I think that I had to increase the dose over and over in order to keep the happy effect going so I had to quit and come back down to the proper dose. I felt unbelievably great as I increased the dose. I took notes on my experience and I was just saying how great I felt and how I had nice memories of my family and my past...my mood was just great.Antidepressants have been in use for a while now so I'm sure there's some wisdom about 1 whether being happy like that is sustainable 2 whether it's healthy or not and 3 whether I could've actually ended that phenomenon of chasing the effect up the dose ladder and gotten the effect to stick.Most importantly when the happy effect was in place all my ADHD medications were working. This was absolutely lifechanging. I can read in my notes that it says over and over if I could only maintain this level of healthy brainfunctioning and ADHDmedication effectiveness then I would have a great life. I wonder if there's anything to be learned from this whole experience that I had with the escitalopram and the ADHD medications maybe the experience can provide a clue as to what to try in order to have a sustainable foundation for my ADHD medications.I do have some anxietydepressionOCD I don't think that it's at the clinical level. I mean I looked up the criteria for OCD and one of them said something about the issues taking up an hour of your time each day so I'm far from that. And when it comes to depression and anxiety it's a situation where I have mild issues where you could probably say that it's unhealthy for me to have the negative tilt to my emotions that I have...again it's nothing clinical though.,Anxiety

I've realized that my anxiety gets worse when I have to talk with people. So I've been trying to better my communication. And Im better actually. I'm feeling more calm around other people. But there is something that it's haunting me since I'm trying to better my anxiety. I realized that there are some people that makes me worse. Sometimes even colleagues. For some reason when I see them or talk with I have a bad feeling a heavy energy and my anxiety explodes. Because of that I cant trust on them. And I'm always in the alert mode when I'm around them. I don't know if this is a problem that my anxiety creates in my mind or if it's something that other people also feels.That's why i'm here. I'm trying to understand if the problem is me and my anxiety or them. Anyone feels like this around some people? Ps I cant get away from some of them because of college and my job unfortunatly ,Anxiety

53014,Overwhelming Fear of Blindness amp Deafness. How Can I Overcome? I've had an overwhelming fear of blindness and deafness for years.I developed tinnitus when I was in high school due to exposure to loud music. My tinnitus isn't awful I'm able to be productive around it. But ever since then I've been fearful of one day losing all my hearing.Also I've been fearful about blindness due to a family history of sight issues dry eye syndrome occasional eye floaters and the fact I often work late nights on my laptop.I saw a doctor about the eye floaters but was told that those are normal and most people get them.I'm conflicted because I have a smartphone compulsion which feeds my fear of visual impairment.I just want to know how I can overcome these fears because they often give me anxiety and I almost cried once out of fear my vision was getting cloudy.I'm sure it's not the end all be all but I fear I won't be able to achieve my dreams filmmaking if my sight and hearing are affected.Would really appreciate any words of encouragement and help.

53015,I can't deal with this anymore My anxiety has gotten really bad lately. It has gotten to the point where I'm getting anxiety attacks almost everyday now and I don't know how to make it stop. I can't stop worrying and overthinking. My brain won't shut up. It has been keeping me up at night and I wake up every morning feeling anxious. I've tried meditation exercising yoga and I even cut caffeine out of my diet but nothing has worked. I feel so exhausted and defeated. I don't think I can cope with this much longer. I feel like I'm on the verge of having a mental breakdown.,Anxiety

53019,My anxiety is telling me not to be honestvulnerable I have a second date anxiety is also telling me its not a date and that Im not of interest to anyone other than people that try to take advantage of me. with someone next week. I am so excited because the first date was a blast. My anxiety is telling me to play it cool and not to look too eager and to only express interest if they express interest first.I would have listened in the past.I think it would be in my best interest to tell them Im looking forward to it because I am. So I am going to tell them that Im excited to see them next week. Better to be myself and turnoff someone that isnt interested in my genuine excitement to spend time with them than it is to keep pretending.,Anxiety
53020,How to tell the difference between mental disorders and shit life syndrome? I've been trying to answer this question for a while. How do I know what's the cause and what's the effect when it comes to mental state? Am I depressed and suicidal because of how my life turned out to be or am I perceiving life to be more shitty than it is because of underlying mental disorders? I have never been to a psychiatrist so I have never been diagnosed but I've been dealing with OCD since I was 6 I experience a lot of MDD anxiety social phobia and ADHD symptoms. I've also been suicidal for more than 6 years at this point. The thing is most of those things appear so small when put next to 7 figures in the bank account. Most of my issues would immediately disappear. Only then I would be able to do things because I can not because I have to. I experience what I'd call a money induced paralysis. I talk a bit more explicitly about it in thishttpswww.reddit.comrGetMotivatedcommentsv4qq6kdiscussionlackofmotivationinducedbylackof thread. It's very unlikely that I'll ever be financially independent and it's unlikely I'll ever find something interesting enough I'd deem worth pursuing for hours on endAKA passion. Those realizations alone are enough to make me apathetic procrastinate on all matters and basically give up on life and wait for the right opportunity to kill myself. I'd rather be dead than live a life I don't consider to be worth the effort. I've been thinking about seeing a psychiatrist for the past few months but I have my doubts. I procrastinate on making an appointment because it feels like my problems stem from money it's not like they'll make me rich over there. In fact I'll lose money. That is enough justification for me not to go. I also can't get myself to schedule other appointments blood tests physio dentist because if my life will remain the same despite improving in some areas then why bother? I'll kill myself anyway without winning a lottery or without some magical epiphany occurring in my mind. I suspect there could be something wrong with my brain because plenty of other people have lives objectively worse than me yet they see survival as something of value in and of itself. That could be the result of them being ignorant me being ungrateful or my brain being disabled. So how do I know whether my shitty mental state is caused by my views on life philosophy bad attitude being lazy ungrateful spoiled etc. or by some condition beyond my reach? Or perhaps that's how it's supposed to be because my conclusions are logical and I just can't ignore them?,Anxiety
53021,Compulsively giving myself anxiety? Recently I just stand doing nothing and then my body gives me anxiety? Like... I used to remember things and get anxious but this time even moving my eyes gives me anxiety? Feels like fear of having that feeling causes that feeling. A sudden sharp pain in chest.

53022,Buspar not for long term result? I just left my primary doctor and suggested BuSpar due to all the good things Ive heard on here. Always turn down SSRIs because of sexual side effects and heard this is better. Anyway she told me buspar is effectively just like Xanax? That I cant take both its one or the other? Theyre both an as needed drug. Is this true? To me Xanax is a bandaid. Long term wont change and work toward a cause. She made it sound like buspar is effectively the same even though its an SNRI not a benzo???,Anxiety
53023,Are SSRI side effects dose dependent? For example is one more likely to experience side effects the higher the dose or the bigger the increase in dose?,Anxiety
53024,I'm getting very anxious about my dental procedure tomorrow It's not something I wanna do but I'm made to do it. I had a root canal procedure because of an infection and my dentist recommends I get a crown for further stability. I personally think it's optional at the moment since it's my front tooth and it isn't subject to a lot of pressure. But you know Asian parents they're forcing me through it tomorrow. I'm so against getting a crown because it involves drilling away healthy tooth structure so that it will fit. It's permanent because tooth enamel can't grow back and so such a procedure I've been constantly anxious about it since the appointment got booked 3 weeks ago. Every day since I've been dreaded for the day which is tomorrow. Has anyone had similar experiences or currently has a crown in their mouth? I'm worried about many things such as whether it feels like your natural tooth whether it's the exact same color or a little bit off.,Anxiety

53035,Oxazepam? Hey! I have been taking oxazepam 75mg15mg once per day for my anxiety for the past 2 months. I'm neurotic about getting addicted eventhough I don't think I have too high risk for that I have been taking those pills max. 2 days per week and I'm even keeping two weeks pause from using them atm. I try to avoid taking those pills even two days in a row.I have them as needed and I was wondering can I continue using them like this or am I going to be addicted? Like if I take 15mg oncetwo times per week for a month and keep two weeks pauses just to make sure? Does anybody here use these pills as needed and how often do you take them?

53038,Nobody takes me seriously Ive 24M dealt with depressionanxiety for years now. I used to be great with people make good money have the nice cars great girlfriend supportive parents friends that I could say looked up to me etc. and then I was diagnosed with depression. Within about a year I quit my job lost my girlfriend even though she was great to me and have yet to keep a stable job for more than a month at a time. My depression eventually was ruled to be treatment resistant after being on a number of meds and trying many other things. Some would work for a couple months and then Id fall even further back from where I was. But now after not having worked since early July of 2022 I am dealing with extensive and scary brain fog. Ive incorporated working out eating healthier taking supplements and just trying to live a healthier lifestyle as I figured this was coming from a bad diet my whole life. I also got all blood work done including thyroid basics vitamin levels testosterone etc and everything came back normal other than pretty high cholesterol. Both doctors Ive seen general practitioner psychiatrist has kinda blown me off when I tell them about the brain fog. Almost like they dont really know what to say or what the next step should be to ruling out causes. Im so scared as Im feeling like Im going crazy or have dementia. My parents are usually very supportive when Im going through stuff but my mom doesnt even want to hear me talk about it and my dad isnt always around as he lives about 45 mins away. I ended up packing some things and driving to his house tonight without saying anything to my mom. I just hate feeling alone and dont know what to do anymore. I feel like Im at the end of my road,Anxiety
53039,selfishness I don't feel very good it's like I don't belong in this world I don't think I ever did. My friends are happy and I'm always the one who's not really funny and who ruins the mood. So now I try to say as little as possible people always ask me if I'm okay if I'm tired or worse they say I'm scary. I think I'm just a mistake. People must find me weird or creepy it's ruining me. A few years ago my brother committed suicide I felt very close to him I think about his death all the time I wish I could start my life over again and make the right choices for once. What affects me the most is girls I think... It's ridiculous but I would love to have a relationship with a very pretty girl. Sometimes I think I've suffered so much that I would at least deserve that. I saw the damage my brother's death caused in my family now I think if I didn't have a family to make suffer gt suicide. My message is so selfish and I know it. Thank you for reading these few lines... Lust,Anxiety
