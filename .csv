I say spots because it doesn’t fill the whole bowl the whole stool isn’t red just red spots. It also appears on my toilet paper time to time. I’m 21 now and the first time anything happened was probably 5 years ago. Doctor did an occult test found nothing but a hemroid sent me on my way with a cream and I was fine for a while. It’s happened on and off since then and usually I either know it’s hemroids or I can trace it back to something red I ate. Recently however it’s gotten worse. About a month ago as my semester was ending there was about a week where I had stomach pains and twice in that week my stool had these red spots. I went to a local walk in clinic and had another occult test done and it also came back nevative. The doctor said it was probably something I ate. I’ve been fine this past month but I just flew back from Europe and twice in the past 3 days I’ve noticed the same red spots. Now each time it happened I had a red fruity drink the day before so I still don’t really think it’s blood but if that’s the case wouldn’t it appear as a liquid in the bowl and not a “spot” as I’ve described.

So a couple months ago I developed a little obsession with misreading things. I misread a couple of words and immediately began to think “there is something wrong with my brain”. Well now it’s manifested itself in just about everything. In a bizarre way to prove I do/don’t have a problem I’ve begun subconsciously “checking” every thing I read and hear to see if I made a mistake. For instance I’ll skim a headline really fast online then get frustrated when I misread it (even though I didn’t carefully read it). Because I’m now “checking” every single word I read and hear I’m constantly misreading mishearing and misunderstanding things because I’m focusing on each individual word and not the sentence as a whole. It’s mentally exhausting and is effecting my reasoning skills and memory which of course is fueling my health anxiety as it further “proves” I have something wrong with me.

It started out with weakness and fatigue and stomach and stool issues which I attributed to colorectal cancer. After multiple blood tests and ct scans that found nothing I made the mistake of looking up my symptoms on doctor google and found als. Ever since (this was early Jan) I’ve been over analyzing every “symptom” I have and haven’t had real peace of mind. It’s taken a huge toll on me mentally and I plan to get help. I’m the last 3 weeks I’ve gone from having twitches all over to burning in my arms to twitching in my hand and now what looks like atrophy in my thenar muscles. I am scared and I just wanted to get it off my chest since my neuro referral won’t come for like another month. Things I have going for me: I am a 23 year old Hispanic male and statistically less probable to get the disease. my twitches are widespread which is uncommon in als. Only recently have they been in my right hand more focused. the “lack of strength” I originally felt isn’t there anymore nor am I dropping things or have any strength loss that I can see. I have gotten back into the gym and can lift things comfortably and well. no family history of neuro diseases. this has been going on for a month without affecting my life (other than mentally) Things I worry about: My right hand palm has some visible dents and lines that I feel have gotten more pronounced. This has not resulted in weakness but they seem to have gotten worse. I’ve googled a lot of pictures and compared to friends and family and I havent found any that look like mine. All I’ve found are clearly atrophied which at that point is completely obvious and don’t look like mine. Mine look as though I’m missing muscle strips and crevices. on the same right hand the thenar muscles have begun twitching as of 5 days ago. My index finger especially will twitch and jump on its own. Also my right thumb/hand is less flexible than my left.

34246,"What is wrong with me? I’ve always been extremely articulate and smart. I operated on a higher consciousness than most people just in the sense that I was more aware of my surroundings and I thought deeply about things. I was also quick witted and being funny was probably my defining personality trait. Until about a week ago I felt like my normal self (still a very anxious person regarding my health particularly a brain tumor). Now I just feel like there’s been a substantial cognitive decline. I can’t think as deeply and I’m constantly second guessing myself on if I’m using words correctly. I feel Ike my vocabulary is getting worse and I google synonyms for words about 30 times a day. At the same time I also feel more relaxed. It sounds weird but I’d rather feel smart and anxious than dumb and relaxed. I’m not even particularly happy. I feel like I have no emotions (something that has been persisting for a while) but now I feel like I have no intelligence (something new to me). I am slower to respond in arguments and don’t feel as witty as I was two weeks ago. Maybe I’m thinking too much about my speech but I just wish I could revert back to normal. Everything just feels so superficial to me. It’s weird. I know a symptom of brain tumors is a shift in consciousness. I’m messing up when I talk a lot more. I feel like I’m forgetting words and not winning in arguments (very rare for me). I’m only 15 (almost 16) and feel like I have Alzheimer’s or something. On a side site the only other truly concerning symptom I have that could be indicative of something more serious is the smell of smoke occasionally. This isn’t a daily occurrence or even a weekly but maybe once or twice a month I’ll get a whiff of the faint smell of smoke that is certainly not coming from real life. As of lately I just feel so dumb. I just can’t stress the fact that I’ve never felt this way before. I hate this feeling. I haven’t really had emotions for a while (this is due to some trauma I’ve been through) but lack of intelligence is brand new. I may not be completely devoid of my intellect (as I’m able to express my thoughts coherently in this format) but I feel slower than usual. I use to partake in writing creative stories and stuff and I tried to do that yesterday and I struggled and was uncharacteristically out of ideas. Sorry if this sounds repetitive but this has been going on for about a week now and I’m not sure what’s up. My parents won’t let me get an CAT Scan (I got an MRI in March 2016 and everything was fine). Is there a possibly a tumor could’ve developed in this short of amount of time? Thoughts and opinions please. I just feel like a completely different person



Also sometimes when I’d feel really weird or things would get too heavy I’d cry and the feelings would subside. Now I can’t even cry cause I feel like I don’t even have feelings in the first place. I use to be able to explain this perfectly all the time (or so it felt like) and I took great pride in my ability to articulate things. Now I feel like whenever I do so there’s a little voice in my head questioning what I say and if it makes complete sense. I now I sound articulate in my post but I don’t feel like I sound like this in real life. Or it at least takes too long for me to express myself. ",Anxiety

34317,"Health anxiety makes everyday tasks so difficult Some background about my health anxiety history - I’ve had severe health anxiety intermittently since my teens. Most often I am preoccupied with my heart. My heart rate has always jumped up quickly (~180ish bpm) with minimal exercise or even at times of rest but my resting heart rate is usually 45-55 bpm. I mention numbers just because my heart rate is a little atypical-but I have been checked out by cardiologists so many times over the past 15 years always with the reassurance that I am fine. Most recently this past summer I wore a 30 day holter monitor where they would measure my episodes of high heart rate. They also did a stress test numerous ekgs etc. They confirmed I had periods of sinus tachycardia but it was normal rhythm and said I was healthy. They said the heart was appropriately responding and was likely beating fast because of anxiety (which I don’t think is the whole story I think I have a food allergy which can trigger it but that’s beside the point.). They gave me a low dose of beta blockers to take as needed for comfort/anxiety but promised I wouldn’t have a heart attack with or without the pills.





TLDR: my health anxiety is about my heart rate/heart attacks. Basic chores like laundry elevate my heart rate and cause panic and avoidance. Feel like I can’t keep up with life. ",Anxiety

It also allows me to recognize my symptoms of stress leading up to an attack so next time I can perform more stringent self-care before it snowballs into an attack. These moments are only making it easier for me to recover from anxiety not making it worse. Stay strong everyone! ",Anxiety

34323,"Advice? Life's become quite hard worrying about heart attacks I'm 19 6'1 and about 75kg. I've drank loads of energy drinks in my life and I'm a bit lethargic I don't do anything deliberately to exercise. But I'm not fat and I don't eat too badly and whatever. No family history of heart attacks at all that I know of just a lot of cancer. But the past 5 months literally every day I worry I'm having a heart attack. Whenever I get a bit of chest pain I sieze up and think ""Right this is it"". And I was never a worrier before this I'm a really confident person don't mind getting up on a stage at all. Yet I spend a lot of my days worried shitless about heart attacks now. I went to hospital a few months ago and had a lot of tests done and they said they'd found nothing wrong with me. I had an ECG (I think it's called EKG in America?) blood test chest x-ray ultrasound in my belly obviously the doc checked me out with a stethoscope and they couldn't find anything wrong. Yet the worry didn't go away. Over Christmas it got really bad I got scared just walking down the stairs thinking it'd kill me. I do get chest pain and I do think it's real and probably happens worse/more frequently to me than most people but it's probably just indigestion or something right? I do eat quite a lot of spicy food and I like fizzy drinks. I don't worry much about other things like cancer I don't worry about them as much as I should. I just worry about heart attacks and suddenly dying. I always feel uncomfortable in my torso and I'm not sure if there's something wrong the doctors haven't found or if if's purely anxiety. I'm not prone to heart conditions or to anxiety which came first? Which one is real? I feel a pain in my chest and I get a shooting pain down my left arm fairly often isn't it natural for me to worry about that? I might have a heart condition that's only detectable when I move around and walk and get the heart going a bit more.


Tl;dr I'm not at risk of heart attack but I worry about it a lot because I get a lot of chest pain. Doctors can't find anything wrong with me. I'm not usually an anxious person but I worry about this more than I probably should. How do I cope? What's wrong with me?",Anxiety

Well for the past week or two I’ve had this random pain in my back primarily my left rib. Naturally the worries happened: cancer of any sort kidney problems etc. Well today I went to the ER (my family doctor lives six hours away) and while they didn’t look inside me he poked and prodded and said that he doesn’t think there’s anything wrong since I didn’t have any other symptoms. Also bercitis (not spelled right) runs in my family which is inflammation in my family’s case the RIBS. So I’m feeling pretty good.

After about ten minutes I picked up my cat to bring her inside and she freaked out and bit me. Since then the though that she might have given me rabies has been constantly on my mind causing a great deal of anxiety. I know that my cat is vaccinated (she was given a 3 year booster 2 and 1/2 years ago) and the neighbor cat was not rabid. I know that rabies especially from cat to humans is very rare in the US.

If you are not hypochondriac and you get stressed due to a chest pain then yes reassurance will work for you and you will get on with your life. But if you are hypochondriac since your mind is in ""worry-mode"" when you are reassured about one of your symptoms yes you will feel temporary relief but it is very likely you will probably find something new to worry about. I was sick and tired of worrying about every single symptom and spending a fortune on dozens of doctors. So one day I decided that I will stop caring about my symptoms and stopped googling and got on with my life no matter what. Then for a few weeks my symptoms and anxiety become worse almost unbearable. Of course they would be. My anxious mind had got used to the instant gratification from reassuarance seeking and was begging for that. But I had said to myself that I would keep myself busy and distracted no matter how anxious I was and ignore my symptoms no matter how much panic I had. Then something very logical happened. My mind decided that since I am not reacting to all these symptoms then they must not be that serious. So it could take some time off and relax and not worry anymore. Then anxiety slowly dissipated and along with that all these symptoms that I thought could give me a diagnosis of 20 extra rare fatal diseases went away as well.

Anyways since yesterday all I've been reading about is brain tumors.

Also when handing the change to the customer (I'm a student but I work part time as a cashier) I dropped a coin twice. Or when he asked me for certain cigarretes I grabbed the blue instead of red ones etc. After the day of overall lack of concentration I started googling and I found that brain tumor may cause clumsiness loss of concentration balance etc. I had a CT scan done 4 years ago due to head trauma but it was clear.

I purchased an older vehicle from Alabama (I live in northern Illinois) on March 3rd 2018. It was shipped that day and arrived March 6th 2018. On March 25th 2018 I opened up the engine cover (It is a van) and discovered a large amount of broken nuts or acorns and what looked like mouse droppings (small round pellets about the size of rice) on top of the engine along with a few chewed wires. I’m assuming that at some point this van sat for a period of time (not sure if recently before purchase but I assume not as there are was no sign of a current infestation to the previous owner prior to purchase). Anyway fast forward to me cleaning it out a few days ago with a regular household vacuum. I don’t believe I used a respirator (mask) for all of the time but if I did it was a 3$ one that is made for basic things like sanding not for chemicals or pathogens. I vacuumed it up for quite awhile probably about an hr. My question is am I at risk for hantavirus? It seems that the virus wouldn’t survive after excretion for very long and assuming that the mice were active until the very day that the van was picked up in Alabama (unlikely) there still would’ve been about 2.5 weeks between then and when I first opened up the engine compartment and another week or so until I vacuumed it up.

When I vomit it’s either this clear liquid that tastes like acid which I assume is acid and sometimes it’s food I eat. Burping helps relieve the feeling for a few minutes but then it’s back.

After the days that followed I had HORRIBLE stomach problems nausea and diarrhea. That lasted a few days before kind of subsiding.

It's usually on the left middle side of my head but sometimes happens on the right. I've also been having bouts of pain in the back of the head as well. I haven't needed to take medicine for this as the pain comes randomly and isn't painful enough to need relief.


From the first day this happened I also had stiff shoulders and neck. I assumed this was because of anxiety/ that the headaches were from stress/ muscle strain.

35299,"Mono nightmare Towards the beginning of 2019 I began feeling something weird in my throat as if a ball of mucus was stuck there. I thought it was allergies but never took any allergy medication. Fast forward to 1 week ago where I'm following a terrible flipped sleep schedule going to sleep at 10am and waking up at 6pm. I woke up at 4pm one day and was so tired that I ended up falling asleep at 10pm. After getting 9 hours of sleep I still remained tired throughout the day. I assumed it was due to my sudden shift in sleep schedules but the daytime fatigue continued. Eventually I scheduled a physical exam to see what was going on all while assuming the absolute worst case scenario. The doctor brought up mono as a possibility but I didn't think much of it.


Again fast forward to today I receive a call from the doctor saying that my bloodwork came back positive for mono. I was shocked. But for some reason I've been having a heart/chest pain that pops up for a few seconds at different times throughout the day and almost as it were to perfectly coincide with my diagnosis. Now there are some complications with mono such as heart inflammation however they are said to be quite rare. My hypochondria is immediately assuming that I am one of those rare cases and have developed a viral heart disease. Does anyone have an experience similar to this with mono? I would love to hear about it. ",Anxiety

Ironically I felt lightheaded just seconds after realizing I’d taken more than the prescribed dose. So I’m guessing that was anxiety because no pill affects you that fast (as far as I’m aware).


I looked it up and it says that 200mg is usually the max dosage. I took 50mg more. I’m afraid to sleep or anything. This happened around 5 hours ago. If I’d overdosed on a fatal level would I have exhibited severe and obvious symptoms by now? I’m just so paranoid now ",Anxiety

I haven’t had an EKG done yet just because I’m in between doctors and my psychiatrist (MD not therapist) said she wasn’t worried about them and thought they were fine when I told her about them.
From what she told me and what I’ve learned I think I’ve been feeling ectopic beats. For me it feels kind of like my stomach drops- like when you’re in an elevator going down. I can also feel like the air is pushed out of my lungs and I feel a super faint little tap in my chest then my heartbeat goes back to normal. I sometimes feel adrenaline and lightheadedness right when it first happens but I’m not sure if that’s a physical response to the palpitation or if it’s my anxiety reacting. I’ve never felt a run of any it’s always just a single missed beat that I feel (when they’re bad I get 3-5 per day at most). I’ve been trying really hard to figure out what triggers them for me and it seems to be correlated with breathing variance stress and posture. For instance I feel them most often if I’m talking quickly and run low on breath and then take in a quick breath. I also feel them sometimes when bending over or bending backward. Also if I’ve been sitting down and then stand up and stretch I can feel a tightness in my whole chest area and my heart will beat slow and hard and I can feel an ectopic if I move too quickly or breathe weird during this. I wanted to know if anyone else has these same triggers and if not then what are they and how do the palps feel? I’m working on not worrying so much about mine but it’s comforting to know other people experience similar things. ",Anxiety

So annoyed with myself even though I guess it isn’t really my fault I used to have pretty bad health anxiety a few years ago.

Right around that time I was also immigrating from the UK to the US so my life got super busy and the health anxiety virtually went away. I’ve been in the US for almost two years now and haven’t really had any ‘big’ health worries since I got the scan done in England years ago...until this week.

This time feels different though when this sort of stuff happened in the past my rational thought was completely obscured to the point where any logical or rational thought would immediately be dismissed in favor of the worst case scenario but this time I’m well aware how irrational I’m being and I’m well aware that it’s most likely just due to this infection.

I say it's different because any other time I felt a spasm I can see the muscle twitch. It's usually happened in my shoulder/upper arm in past. This one is in my thigh but it feels more like a cellphone vibration that's been coming and going intermittently. I'm a fairly active muscular guy who's been focusing on running alot. In the past when I neglect the gym for a few days I've noticed these things happen.

35412,"Hit my head on car trunk and caused my health anxiety to soar Im a 22 year old male and I hit my head Saturday afternoon on my car tailgate right before I went to go fish with some friends. It was the very top of my head but more towards my left side. Don’t really think it caused many problems other than hurting because I was still able to fish and remember when it happened and the events after it happened (didn’t blackout or whatever). Later Saturday night I felt my head and realized that it actually got cut and it’s looks kind of like a small raspberry-type injury about the size of a dime maybe smaller.

Anyways this caused me to become a huge hypochondriac and elevated my anxiety as I began to think about brain bleeds and what not. My pupils never became dilated and I’ve just had a minor headache which could possibly be due to stress/anxiety but the pressure is in my face (eyes and nose area). The place where I hit is still sore and has the common goose-egg. I’ve got a unrelated doctors appointment Friday and wanted to know if y’all thought I would be fine until then.

Afterwards the burning was barely noticeable but I know it was still there. Saturday morning I wake up and it’s still barely noticeable but still there so I make a doctors appointment. Unfortunately my regular doctor isn’t in that day and neither is my usual back up so I book with the only doctor that’s in. At this clinic for as long as I could remember (I’ve gone here for over 10 years) they usually give you the results of the urine sample before you leave keep this in mind that was the only reason I went because I convinced myself the only thing this could be is a uti or perhaps something worse even though I know I don’t have any of the symptoms but you never no right? It’s better to be safe. Anyways she comes in and I explain my problem. At first she mentions it could just be irritation and she mentions something in particular that I do to dry my nether regions and I thought wow I could of actually cut myself or overwashed and a wave of relief washed over me. Because I do tend to overwash and use scented products. But then she said she would prescribe me a medication if I have a uti. She left and the nurse came in a few minutes later. The whole thing took 5 mins.

It all started with an actual kidney issue which later resolved itself and the only possible cause was ""stress"". Since then I have had a huge fear of STI's which led to my ultimate fear of cancer and warts caused by HPV (especially throat/mouth). I have always had some form of anxiety when I was younger I'd pull out my eyelashes and scour my face for blemishes. I believe this has led to me being so hard on my self that I notice any imperfection. I have tonsil stones and while I stuck my finger down my throat I went past my tonsils this time ( gross I know) and I felt a bump almost like a skin tag. This led to me feeling so panicked I became physically ill and left work early. Since then I've been googling and come to the conclusion that I can't keep doing this to myself. Normal people do not stick their fingers down their throat to find god knows what. Of course It's going to feel weird down there.

35550,"Am I Going Crazy? So I’m a healthy 27 year old American woman (today is my birthday) and the last few months have been almost unbearable and I can’t seem to get a grip on anything. For reference it all started last November when I started having pain in my upper left abdomen that wouldn’t seem to go away. I’m currently living in Spain which is where I’m currently living and working. My doctor said that I had acid reflux and told me to what I ate. Pain persisted lots of mucus coming out constipation tons of gas. Decided to take a probiotic and managed to get my symptoms to disappear for a month while on winter break. Then in January the pain came back. My stools were hard and dark and the pain was consistent. Had an ultrasound and was told that I had tons of gas in my colon so they couldn’t see clearly but my other organs looked good. But then my coworker suddenly began having blood in her stool too and many intestine issues. Turns out that she had worms. I decided to check my stool found something that looked like a worm went to the emergency room tool mebendazol to get rid of the worms (This also made sense because I lived in Asia for 2 years before Spain and had just recently moved).
I took my second dose of the worm medicine had a stool sample that came back clear of everything (no blood) and even a chest X-ray that was clear. I’ve been secretly worried that I have colon cancer since a friend of mine suddenly died at age 25 from it. She had no symptoms and went to the doctor with a persistent cough and ended up having stage 4. Since my lung issues flared up I’ve been so worried that I have some cancer that has metastasized and went to my lungs. I haven’t been able to completely shake this cold yet and it’s been over 3 or 4 weeks. I still wake up and spit up yellowish colored spit. Lungs feel a bit off. To make matters worse I’m still having stomach problems after being cleared of the worms and my doctor says that I probably have IBS. Then last night I began having heart palpitations and rushed to the emergency room. My EKG was normal and my blood test was normal. She said I have pvcs and need to relax. Honestly I just feel like I’m shutting down and I haven’t felt healthy in a long time. I can’t seem to shake this chest cold my digestive problems are still there have some reflux too and now pvcs.

I am a 27 y.o male and have been seeing my chiro for years because I would get headaches. He uses the drop table method and I have had my neck adjusted 100s of times before. Last week I went to my doctor for an unrelated visit and mentioned I was seeing a chiropractor. He responded right away ""dont let him touch your neck"" he told me that an older patient of his had had a stroke days after a neck adjustment because of a torn artery. Now I will mention that the chiropractor this patient had seen was using a different type of manipulation on the neck as opposed to the thompson (drop table) method. At my chiropractic appointment yesterday he did what he normally does and worked kn my back and neck. this time my neck was sore all night and I have not been able to sleep or focus on work or my kids because all I can think about is ""what if he tore something what if I am going to have a stroke????"" seems silly right? Anyone who has health anxiety knows that these ludicrous thoughts seep into our mind and pollute our rationality and thinking. I have all but convinced myself I am going to have a stroke and die and leave my kids behind fatherless no matter how crazy I know it sounds. My neck hurts as of writing this but very mild discomfort perhaps a 2 out of 10. I would assume if you tore an artery you would feel it?

I never figured out where it came from but I ended up in the ER for fear of a heart attack. Had all the symptoms just about. This occurred about 2-3 more times within a week or two and it got to the point that the doctor got frustrated and told me I was wasting the ERs time and money on potential people who may actually need it and gave me a low amount of Xanax and a referral for a therapist. After then I had lingering chest pains for seemingly 24/7 so I also went to a cardiologist and did several tests from ecgs/EKGs to wearing a heart monitor for varying times with one month being the longest. Turns out my heart was 100% healthy and the healthiest he had seen in years which was surprising considering I was a smoker and drank too much caffeine and drank a bit too much. I still smoke drink caffeine and drink here and there but I've cut down tremendously since. I was in therapy for 6 months. It mostly involved us talking things through but we also got to a point where I would try to purposely induce attacks so we could with through them together in order to learn how I can tackle them by myself. Another thing we did that helped was write down my current health fears (biggest one was fearing a brain aneurysm would come at any time because of my constant headaches and ice pick headaches) and I would also write why it was making me scared. Then I would come back for my next visit two weeks later and she'd have me read what I wrote and it always sounded insane but never ever for me to stop being worried entirely but overtime it got better. I was diagnosed with hypochondria/health illness anxiety. I have since moved to California after being in therapy for 6 months. For whatever reason it was like a complete 180 from worrying about it all the time to not worrying about it much at all anymore. I would still get some attacks here and there but I always managed them one way or another.


I haven't seen my doctor in a couple months and I'm going to make an appointment in the morning and talk with her about it and see what we can do as well as probably set up to see another therapist for what I'm assuming to be depression.

The app couldn’t even measure it for a minute I watched the lines squiggling all over the place extremely tiny and just bouncing everywhere. Finally got a reading of 210 bpm and so I sat and tried to calm down some more and it finally slowed to about 160bpm then about 10 minutes later I was back in the low 100s range.

I am on Lamictal Wellbutrin XL Ritalin and Lunesta and I'm not keen on the idea of avoiding the hassle by going off of them for the week. I looked at the State Department and Spanish Embassy websites and they talk about letters forms export and import licenses...all of which is SO not helping my anxiety.

I also was prescribed some Stilnox which was totally awesome if not for my shitty depressive episodes where I would try to sleep all the time and all the mania where I just wanted to hallucinate all the time. Anyway! The Lamotrigine made me feel so fucking awful. I was a zombie for the longest time. Felt no emotions no sex drive I was pretty absent as a girlfriend (which led to the demise of a really great relationship) no motivation to do anything from work to studies et cetera. It wasn't working so she kept up-ing the dose and also asked me to take some Inderal to calm down the increasing anxiety I had.



Meanwhile - This is probably not advisable but because I can't wait between appointments I started self medicating. Went totally sober. No alcohol no cigarettes no weed (which apparently turns BPD people schizophrenic or something? Which sucks because it was so great for the anxiety) no popping benzos - or any other drug. Started working out more consistently. Controlled my eating. I went back on the Lamotrigine BUT this time I started taking the branded GSK Lamictal. Started with 50mg. I paired it with 10mg of Inderal. I FELT SO GREAT!!!! I was having episodes all the time but this calmed me down in a non-zombie way. I started building a tolerance to it though - I think? My anxiety would come back worse. Weeks into this routine I went up gradually to 250mg of Lamictal and 40mg of Inderal. I'm feeling really great. I know it's not mania.

45652,"Hypomanic phases+hypersexuality=social suicide *disclaimer: I understand that this post is insanely long but I feel condensing it will dilute its message. Some of this is unrelated to my bipolar II but it still plays a central role in my issue so I felt this would be the best place to post this (plus I don't know where else to post). Little new here. I've been suffering from the symptoms of bipolar II along with social anxiety since my early teens so throughout middle/high school it crippled me socially. My rapid awkward all-over-the-place speech in my hypomanic phases and my mumbly confused speech in depressive phases (if I even spoke at all) along with anxiety kept me from really connecting with anyone and i was never able (and still am not very able) to display my true self something that crushes/depresses me to this day. It also SERIOUSLY held me back academically/athletically. I was a straight-A student with a promising competitive swimming career up until around 9th grade when my disorder had grown to an unmanageable level due to it going untreated and it continued to for the rest of high school with my relatively strict parents calling it bullshit at every turn and never getting me in any counseling or put on any meds until i dropped out of college at 18. Only then did they listen and see an issue. Knowing that I never realized my potential in any area of my life sends me flying into bouts of extreme depressive episodes in which I cry over what could have been and it can last days. I only thought I had depression at this point so I was misdiagnosed for another year. Now at 20 I am finally diagnosed properly and on a mood stablizier although it hasn't been particulary effective and smoking weed and dropping acid probably doesn't help matters. But I must admit that my first couple trips allowed me to take inventory and understand that I've been bouncing between manic/depressive phases since childhood and that my issue quite possibly extends into sex addiction/hypersexuality. And it brought certain behaviors and memories to the surface that I wasn't willing to face and it's a big reason why I'm even here posting this (I DO NOT condone the use of LSD especially for the people on this subreddit). Now we get to the main point that the title addresses (not sure if I had to give ya'll my life story first).Throughout my adolescent life a common theme has been my complete and utter lack of control of my sexual impulses resulting in shameful behavior that I keep buried away from many: public masturbation. At the beach with a towel over me in the nearest public bathroom and even IN CLASS. I knew it was disgusting as I was doing it but simply HAD to get off constantly like some nympho. I could only dart to the bathroom throughout the day so many times (our monthly hall passes gave us a limited number of times to leave class). After reflecting I feel that this urge was aggravated by a combination of my hypomanic phases (which involves being too horny) and my hypersexuality bringing my sex drive to an INSANE level. If this is the case then it would explain that behavior. It doesn't justify it but it gives insight into how this happened. And teachers did NOTHING to address it. Unless the kid's autistic I would have confronted me about it if I were in their shoes and it may have gotten me the help I needed sooner. Because they turned a blind eye it continued to fester and get worse. I understand that it's not their job to counsel me but such extreme behavior warrants attention I was very sick and nobody helped me. There is one exception in which we were watching a movie in class a year after I discontinued my in-class meat-beating. A risque scene comes on and my teacher promply says ""Ok settle down John."" to which the class erupts into the most intense laughter I've ever heard that rings in my ears to this day. So if anything they made it worse. I quickly became known as that creepy kid that beat it in the back of class bc well.... I WAS that creepy kid that beat it in the back of class. I never stared at some chick's ass to set it off mind you if anything I blocked out the world to focus on my animalistic impulses. So if anyone wants to call me a gross creep save it bc I'm already aware :( But this realization that it may not have been my fault that I'm not a complete pervert really makes me feel better and could bring me at peace but I feel I cannot confirm it without getting some outside opinions and I don't want to go to anyone else (friends family etc.) other than my psychiatrist bc I'm so shameful of it and I fear they would look at me different for the rest of my life. I've just been hurting for such a long time and I'm desperate to get answers about this bc I'm too hung up on it and I likely will continue to be until I come to peace with it.

After a negative experience with my father during the holidays my anxiety only increased until by January I couldn't get a handle on it. It developed in to full blown paranoia. I was (and still somewhat am) convinced I was being watched especially from the strip of woods behind my house. Every time my German Shepherd would let out a guard dog bark at the back door I would lose my shit. If I needed to go to the grocery store I would go either very early in the morning or very late at night when there would be virtually no one there. If I turned to go down and aisle and saw another person there I was overcome with a sense of uncomfortable dread and would wait in hiding until I saw them leave the aisle and go elsewhere.

The store would be selling specific genre records (growing at double digits %) dystopian/speculative/sci-fi/high fantasy books; and games like D&amp;D and Magic and Catan and similar things. Stores that carry everything and try to cater to everyone struggle but boutique style stores serving specific markets do okay and can develop a solid customer base.

I'm very hesitant about identifying myself with a disability. I was able to stay on my dad's insurance with a letter from my doctor but I'm not sure what applies for this. I'm really nervous about letting any of my employers know I am Bipolar. I'm pretty good at hiding my illness but I have depressive dips that last for a few months and they affect my work. I'm on medication but currently I've been having hormonal issues that I'm dealing with my gyno. I get very antisocial and irritable but I am afraid of my work trying to get rid of me if they knew. I know they technically they're not allowed to but I work in the Biotech industry and they can be very cutthroat. I don't want to not be hired for a job if I was upfront with being bipolar. I also do value my privacy and I don't want the whole world knowing about my illness. I was hoping someone out there has been dealing with this issue and can offer some advice.

He acted out in elementary school and attempted suicide and was sent to a psych ward where he was diagnosed.

Since hes type one if he leads a healthy lifestyle he wont get manic again and wouldnt need an anti psychotic. Great. Thats what he wanted anyways.

I have friends who do them but they aren't addicted they're functioning adults even though they smoke and/or play video games. Some thoughts on this; What is the cycle of addiction and bipolar? Maybe it is that at some point in the cycle you need help mentally like anything to feel good because you're in the depressive part of the cycle or maybe you're in the manic part and HAVE to do something ""cool"" and ""fun"" so either way you go to your addiction your life force what keeps you here.

Get frustrated at all their suggestions walk out feeling worse than I did going in. Then my meds will get adjusted or I'll cycle back up again and feel absolutely fine and quit therapy until the next crisis.

Anyway my point is that I always get embarrassed by how melodramatic I get during depressive episodes and because of this I am scared to go back to therapy and repeat this pattern.

I've never felt quiet right but I tried to accept it as I never wanted to be categorized as someone who's mentally ill. But lately I notice I'm getting worse and the only way to describe it for me when I found the word 'Manic depression'/'Bipolar'. It's as if I felt understood for the first time. A lot of my time I spend alone on my room except when I go out to meet friends. So my family doesn't know much of my personality. Last summer I had a job at the same restaurant my sister works and she/coworkers noticed how I'm often staring into space while smiling and this is a big part of me. Whenever I experience this full on power high feeling as described by people during manic depression I get lost in my fantasies and I feel as if the world surrounding me no longer exist and build up whole scenario's and imagine people to be near me. For example I would imagine to be in a big house while holding a conversation with a person I want to speak with and I would laugh at their jokes as if it were their jokes. most of the time my life is amazing in these deep daydreams sometimes they could be described as another persons nightmare. I'm not even hating this. I feel a part of it is a coping mechanism which goes hand in hand with my natural creativity. And I love the force of energy I have during these moments. How I can smile as if I'm drunk just by staring and thinking about all the amazing things i can accomplish. by thinking how charming I am. And then the next second I could cry. I'm not sure if it's how I really feel sad. Or if it's an overload of happiness that makes me sad in the moment. ButI really burst of energy in which I actually do accomplish a lot. I know it's not a healthy me but it's the best version of myself if I want to get things done. I feel as if it isn't totally me but more a phase. But I love who I am during this phase. Because the other part of me is depressed and has no energy. I hate admitting to this part because while I know my life situation sucks and would had likely made anyone insane and as I have experienced horrible things and have anxiety I hate accepting that a big other side of me is useless by depression. As I feel like I'm constantly trying to fight it and these moments of feeling high/happy actually make me feel at times as if I'm on the right track. But now I read more about this subject I feel I'm not winning any battle at all when feeling high on energy is just another extreme on the spectrum.

The medication is proven to be severely damaging to our bodies and often meds stop working all together but are difficult to stop taking due to withdrawals. I'm not anti med in anyway but I'm anti long term meds. No doubt medication has helped during acute episodes but keeping me on them long term did more damage to my life than good.

46390,"Improving Physique and Body Confidence causing onset of some mania symptoms? Hey guys I’m a 22 yo male in college and I have been lifting 6 days a week for a while now. I would say I’m pretty built and over the last few weeks I have definitely been becoming more defined (guess that happens when the holiday season and all the food that comes with it finishes haha). My body confidence is definitely improving and my attitude in general has become better because of it. The issue is the last time I really looked good it caused me to almost have too much confidence and for someone with bipolar I feel this could be an issue. The last time I crashed there were a lot more factors involved and I have learned a lot since. I do not drink alcohol anymore and I have cut back my marijuana usage substantially. I am currently eating a normal amount of food and getting enough sleep everyday. But I’m noticing some possible signs of some type of mania coming if I’m not careful. This means I will probably have to up my meds dealing with the mania but these meds often cause weight gain so taking more may take away a lot of what I have worked for exercise-wise. I feel like I’m stuck in that I have to make a choice between my mental and physical health (along with my body confidence). I will obviously choose mental health if push comes to shove because I do not want to experience the same crash that I did last time but it just feels unfair.

My anxiety began to grow to the point where i felt like the ground was shaking below me all the time and the walls were creaking. I got an intense ptsd flashback where I acted out. There were some nights were i was SURE that all the cameras were watching me and people in photos or paintings were spying on me. This would be around the time work would get complicated and I would need to leave but for the first time ever I pushed myself through it and made it!

46495,"Been lurking over a year on this sub and wanted to share some good news. So I have bipolar 1 with psychotic features as per my diagnoses and I wanted to share some good news with this wonderful community. I will preface this by saying that after I got out of the hospital over a year ago (pretty long and arduous stay around 4 months) I was lost and I had no optimism about my future once I got my phone back I started googling med related things and this subreddit would always come up. I started to realize slowly that there are a large number of people with bipolar living productive and stable lives and that exhibit linear thinking. I thought I was relegated to being acutely ill for the rest of my life and that. I would have at least two major manic episodes a year that would always get me hospitalized. I will spare some of the details about these episodes because they are honestly a bit embarrassing and I imagine they could be triggering (drug usage). Anyways it has been over a year since my last manic episode and I haven't even experienced hypo-mania in the interim. Over the last year I went from living in group homes and care facilities to finally going back to college and getting A's and went back to work. I have been living in my own apartment for 5 months and have never had a period of stability this long. I think what actually worked for me was staying on medication for more than 6 months and working with a treatment team. I am actually really happy with my psychiatrist from Stanford and actually appreciate his style. He doesn't just shove pills in my face and actually takes over an hour to ask about how im doing and then during the last 5 minutes we talk about meds. He was even willing to take me off of my monthly injection and switch me to a lower dose oral dosage which seemed shocked me as the shot was the one thing that I would consistently take due to non-compliance. This made me realize that he trusted me and after that I started trusting him. My relationships are really solid now too and I have actually kept a friend instead of burning all my bridges like before. I actually got a job volunteering at one of the residential facilities I was a client at and this really helps to give me a feeling of fulfillment. I also started making music again which really helps as well. Lastly I think that staying sober (with the exception of the occasional beer with family) has been a huge factor in my stability.

I was diagnosed as BPII a little over a year ago and began seeing a psychiatrist not long after. Personally I think the world of my psychiatrist. But I am still struggling a lot. At times I feel like we've made no progress. Dealing with the illness has been a long difficult learning experience that has also been painful at times. I know that it can potentially take years to find the right combination of medications. So I've tried to keep this in mind through all the medication adjustments and changes. I'm beginning to lose hope that there is a drug or a combination of them that will allow me to function like a (mostly) normal person.

I feel totally enraged and dehumanised. I have recently moved back to the UK (specifically London) after having attended university in the US. This is important because the two countries have different rules regarding prescription medications. It was in the US that I received my bipolar diagnosis and started treatment. When I first moved back my GP was happy to renew all my prescriptions from the US so I do currently have enough Depakote to last me a few months but he also referred me to a new psychiatrist. I met with her for the first time yesterday and she said that in the UK they do not prescribe Depakote to women of childbearing age because it can cause birth defects and she would not be able to keep me on as a patient if I were to continue to take it. I'm on a lot of medications for a multitude of health conditions and it took months of painful trial and error to find a drug for bipolar that didn't give me unbearable side effects and also played nice with my other medications. Finally finding Depakote was the best thing that happened to me. I really don't want to go through the pain of finding a new drug all over again. Especially as I've recently been through some trauma (coming out of an emotionally abusive relationship) and am worried how the instability of coming off and on medications might impact me.




She was deliberately vague about what the 'rules' are surrounding this and if another psychiatrist would be allowed to prescribe it to me or not. My pharmacist certainly had no issues giving it to me after I said I had an IUD. Has anyone else been through this and know what the rules are?

I googled my symptoms for days until I was convinced I had bipolar disorder. I told my psychiatrist I was seeing things and that I was paranoid. I said that so they too would be convinced and help me get rid of those terrible racing thoughts. I ended up becoming more convinced that all of this was real. The depression got worse and worse after a few more months I didn't want to live anymore. The racing thoughts stopped after a month of rest. The antipsychotics they put me on afterwards made me sleep all day which was nice at first but I lost all motivation a little while later. The antipsychotics also made me fat which I didn't like. I was also put on lithium which made me thirsty and made my hands tremble. At a certain point in time I was no longer depressed. Shortly afterwards I went on a long holiday to my parents in Africa where I stopped taking my antipsychotics. I still take lithium but I'm planning to stop taking that as well.

Anyone who wears one of these buttons is signaling that they’re open to sharing their personal story of how the medication helped.

I told myself two weeks ago that I would give myself a week to live and make everyone around me happy just a few more times. I tried extremely hard to hang out with all my friends (after isolating myself for months) to talk to my parents (after we got into a terrible argument) and to experience the things i love about the world. Obviously i didn’t kill myself i didn’t even attempt. I’ve been at points in my life where I’ve just given up but this doesn’t feel like that. This feels like I’ve been desperately grasping at anything that can give me a reason to live just one more day over and over. I’ve found that the small things are the most effective because it’s hard to see myself with any “big” future. I can’t tell if this is good or bad. I know it’s good that I’ve been trying to escape these suicidal thoughts and use every coping mechanism I know but the fact that nothing seems to work for more than an hour or two seems disheartening.

So I had an issue on Friday evening. I had what my husband thought was a seizure but the emergency room physician said was a dystonic reaction likely to my medication (seroquel 100mg) which I’ve been on for about two years at varying doses. Aside from that I’ve been having odd neurological symptoms for about the same amount of time that I’m having investigated by a neurologist currently. So I’m seeing a new psychiatrist and at the request of the treating doctor Friday they have come to the decision to taper me off of seroquel and add a mood stabilizer. I’ve never tried a mood stabilizer. This is the plan so far. She also affirmed my bipolar diagnosis made by the last psychiatrist I saw and also suspects I suffer from PMDD. But that’s another story. Week 1 50mg of seroquel nightly 450mg of depakote Week 2 25mg of seroquel nightly 900mg of depakote Week 3 Stop seroquel (Start 1/2 tablet of trazodone for sleep as needed)just wanted to hear positive experiences with depakote.

While pregnant I was on a very low dose of my medications I had taken before I became pregnant. We were not trying to get pregnant but ended up conceiving on our wedding night. After giving birth I started suffering from PPD. I hated my daughter wanted absolutely nothing to do with her. I sought treatment at a private hospital that had a mother-baby ppd program. I had my tubes tied to prevent another pregnancy and I thought that was a great idea. I thought I was one and done. After the tubal ligation I had a lot of other complications which lead to my having a full hysterectomy.

I started at .5 mg of Klonopin and now I'm at up to 1.5 mg per day (prescribed by my doctor). Even at the upper level it doesn't do much. With Xanax I have to take like 3-4 mg just to feel what I used to get with .5 or 1 mg. Of course I know that's getting to the point of substance abuse which is a problem I don't wanna have.

Has anyone else experienced benzo tolerance getting to a point where you have to take very excessive amounts just for a small benefit? Also I'm considering tapering down for a short while so that if I end up taking more than my regular dose it actually helps instead of barely registering.

And while a lot of these habits/things are enjoyable in the moment once I push past my ""but I don't wanna"" inner toddler brain I'm so sick of having to do so much all the time just to maintain ""okay"".And truth be told lately I haven't. Life has been unnecessarily shitty and I've had to make so many decisions and compromises on big things like my job and living situation that I crumpled. And I know working out would make a much bigger difference to my mood right now than writing this post but I'm sick of everything. Why does life insist on being such a shit show?

Update: After writing this briefly texting with a redditor who was kind enough to reach out to ask if I'm okay and feeling my feelings for a bit (aka crying) I put on my workout clothes and got it over with. It didn't do much right then and there but I also went to bed on time to get a proper night's rest and I woke up feeling a little better. So up and onwards I go until the next time I veer off track managing myself. Because there really isn't an alternative. I know how low I get when I throw in the towel and don't pick it back up again quickly enough. ",Depression

I was always on 100 mg zoloft &amp; then switched to 20 mg lexapro in 2018 but went off of them for about 6 months in 2021 to try to live without them. At the end of those 6 months I started to get dizzy more often &amp; have what I can only describe as uncontrollable thoughts. Not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone but I just did not feel in control of my emotions and I felt like I was gonna lose my mind lol &amp; very depressed. So I got back on lexapro 20 mg &amp; after a few months I started to feel average at best but better than before. August 2022 I started to get brain zaps/dizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start. I worked my way up to 75mg &amp; started to feel a lottttt better but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since. Very dizzy lots of anxiety &amp; panic attacks and the weird uncontrollable emotions/thoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since. It gets A LOT worse at night and that’s when most of my issues arise.
Within the last 6 months I’ve seen an ear doctor to make sure I didn’t have inner ear issues causing dizziness an eye exam (I got a small prescription mostly for being on my phone/computer or reading) and I got an MRI done and saw a neurologist.

So now she gets diagnosed with BPD and I’m wondering if this would have an effect on her sex drive also! I also have BPD but I still have a sex drive… It’s getting to the point that I want to leave the relationship cause I’m not getting what I need!

I see death as an option to free my body of its ailments and the stupidity that caused it had i not hurt myself i would be taking a different path but im pretty much disabled now and have tried to fight the healthcare system with no diagnosis and been labelled as crazy by every person i meet. I wont sing dance look or feel the same way again so for me thats not worth it. I always dreamt of doing those things but now i will never be able to do them efficiently. I dont see death as a bad thing just terrifying and really hard to process and a way to get out of a shitty life i would rather die than be in a lot of situations really because we all die anyway i dont really want to suffer for too long. And the world doesnt care because it will just keep spinning. so there arent any negative feelings just logical and impartial situation which i accept. Everyone will die too so rather sooner than later. Otherwise I would have a degree in performing arts or music by now and would be performing and doing things with my life.

I was just a child and had poor self esteem and confidence even though I didn’t know about those concepts yet. I was afraid to interact with others and felt like everywhere I went people were laughing at me. This lasted all the way until I graduated high school.


I have tried therapy but the “relief” was only brief. I would take a picture or catch my reflection at a different angle and be reminded just how ugly I am. I want to accept it but it’s so hard.

But 3 years later (graduating from a community college) my therapist (another one) just helped me realize I still have depression.

My study turned my passion into mindless work. I am too broke and too far down the study to stop it now. I have one year left. Therapy does not help and I do not trust depression meds. I am lonely surrounded by people. What does one do when negativity takes over? I was told depression means I am not in the right place. That my lifestyle needs to change. Yet...I am barely managing to do the little I am doing. I am trying to take responsibility for my situation and change what I can control but...it all falls short. I feel like I am chasing something but even when I stop and appreciate the moments it is just a fleeting break from the endless torture.


Yet...this is not how I felt just a few days ago. It comes and goes. For a few days I feel like a human and then I plunge back into this torture. Like on a rollercoaster.

My depression used to comes in waves and typically I could handle and channel it into art or music or something but recently this one I haven't been able to shake it and it's killed my productivity. I don't know really what set it off I never do. But in it I've realized alot about myself amongst other things which makes me feel worse. Ill go through some but this ones a biggie. For context I was dating a girl for a while (when it started i was like 15 and she was 18 going on 19) and she was allways emotionally abusive in some form but it all went down hill my junior year when I was 17 she started drinking more often and mixing her meds with it. Long story short she ghosted for like 3 or 4 months and when she did contact me it was pretty much to say she's dumping me and moving to Florida with a ""friend"" she met in college who I have on good report she was cheating on me with. I still haven't emotionally recovered from that mess every negative thing that happened to me has left me afraid of a repeat in my next relationship. Since then my life got worse year after year and it's only just starting to stabilize again. One of those years though has left me blaming myself for getting my grandmother sick during covid leading to her death in 2021. There where other horrible events that lead me to here and now. On new year I decided to try to recapture how I use when I was 15. I was relatively happy I had confidence and drive to try to reach my dreams and personal goals and I had friends and people that loved me. But I cant all those aspects of me just don't last each time I mange to reclaim somepart of my former self something happens to destroy it and leave me worse off. In my attempt to reclaim something I've realized how far I've fallen behind people I considered friends and looked up to. They have great jobs they're chasing their dreams forming families surviving on their own going to college and are making something of themselves and I'm still in our home town working at the local Casey's living in a spare room my stepfather and bio mother had no plans for. I'm not even sure they wanted me here they say they do but I know they didn't want a 20 year old moving inafter being kicked out. It's like no remnants of my former self exists if younger me could see me and realize how much I've changed for the worse he would beat me for wasting time and destroying what little attractiveness we had. I've always realized change was one of those things that are inevitable like death. I've always realized me from 6 years would be different from me now but I just always hoped it'd be for the better and not the worse possible thing to happen to me. The few people I've vented have always told me something about gods testing or he has a plan for me but fuck he must really despise me to make my grandfather (who I lived with from 1 to 20) an abusive drunk who loved yelling screaming and threatening me every chance he got till he kicked me out the day after Christmas put me in an abusive relationship let me get bullied horribly by almost everyone and take away one of the the few people I knew care for me and make her death be on my head. Change is a constant and I've been changed so much that in just I few years that I'm permanently altered and the realization that I can't go back has hurt me far worse then any person can.

She found a therapist and I started medication for ADD. It helped and I continued taking it until I graduated in 2017. My freshman year my friend had committed suicide. It never really hit me until his funeral. Where I promised to myself to never cause that much pain to the people that love me. I swore that day I would never commit suicide while I still have friends and family that love me. Just so I could never cause them that much pain. But I’ve realized something changed in me or rather hasn’t changed in me since that day. I’m not living for me. I haven’t been living for me in such a long time. I’ve only ever lived for the people I care about. Recently my 8 year long relationship came to an end. I tell myself it’s for the best. That I couldn’t treat her right anymore. That we grew apart. But she understood sadness and depression. She lived with it for all of her life. And I failed her by letting my resentment of our relationship get the better of me. I’m proud she was able to leave me. I couldn’t ever leave her I wasn’t strong enough. So now I’m left with the realization. I have been living my life 3 months at a time. Never looking further because I feel that I will be dead by next year. Feeling like it doesn’t matter what I do. I’ve set myself goals and I’m getting therapy for the first time in over a decade. But I can’t shake the feeling of failure. The feeling that no matter what I do it won’t matter. Because I’ve masked this feeling since I was young. Because I believed the lie I was telling everyone. And now that lie is witness to the world. So my question is Is anyone truly happy? Is anyone actually happy? Because for me happiness was chasing a feeling of being wanted being appreciated respected. I could only catch small instances of it. So now I ask how do I become happy again?

You know you still don't have the sufficient social skills or enthusiasm about life necessary to be attractive to women but you persist with this life anyways trying to learn what you can from the men you see around you who seem happy able to confidently express themselves who bring good vibes who have something to say and are interesting. And then inevtiably you look at where you are in life. What you know what you are like. You are trying to change but it's not working really. You try to have a real interest and love for things in this world but it is not coming naturally. Due to whatever mental or developmental reason you constantly forget about the things you try to learn about. Moat of your brainpower is being used trying your hardest to be socially acceptable and not seen as an awkward teenager in an adult's body.

47666,"I feel like a nuisance I feel as if I am nothing more than a general nuisance to people. I say this because I had a falling out with someone that I once considered to be my best friend while we were both away at college last fall. I've known this young lady since high school and I had a lot of trouble trying to make connections and new friends and thus she was the only person I really had up there because I was so lonely. She felt that I wasn't giving her any space and that I was too intrusive and as a result it feels like she wants nothing to do with me anymore. Sometimes I question if she really wanted me around. I remember during her birthday last year she had a bit of a celebration and I only found out because her then boyfriend posted it on Instagram. I felt left out. She said that she didn't want a large group and thus only invited people her parents didn't know and planned on celebrating separately with people they already knew. When we did just that she texted me two minutes before I was supposed to have her up that she was at a pizza party and would be running late. She did not show for another two hours. This past month I've tried to reach out to her in an attempt to make amends she barely responds to me. I asked if we could be able to talk in person over face time or over the phone but I get no response. Because she seldom responds I feel I have to start the conversation all over again. It's stressful and it hurts my feelings.

Meanwhile before I went up to college I worked as a lunch monitor at one of my local elementary schools. This was immediately after I finished high school. While I loved working with the children I had some problems there. Some of the kids were defiant and very stubborn in their defiance. In the months before I went off to college I tried to start a bowling club but most of the kids would not even listen me and would just rough house and fool around. But the worst part was the treatment I was received from two separate staff members. During the 2020-21 school year when I started working at the school lunch was held in the classrooms and not the cafeteria. In the Kindergarten classroom I worked in there was a young boy who had trouble remaining seated and the teacher got angry with me. For two whole months she would scream at me calling me ""irresponsible"" complaining about ""how I can't be trusted"" and how I must be ""firm"".

47668,"Partner with chronic depression started ghosting me seeking advice I've been seeing this person for about 5 months and until recently everything seemed to be going really well between us. We texted most days and hung out around 2 times a week on average which felt like a lot considering their time off and energy levels. About a month and a half ago they told me they were having a depressive episode. I've never had a partner with chronic depression and was pretty ignorant to what it can do so I was taken by surprise when they started ghosting me about a week ago. It was very abrupt and everything seemed to be going really well until then. Since then I've tried my best to learn up and it and it seems like this kind of thing is pretty common among people with chronic depression especially those who've had a long history of partners who do not react well to their depression.








Given all this I'd just like some advice from those also struggling with chronic depression about how you'd like a partner who you've been seeing for as long as I've been seeing mine to communicate with you during situations like this. My current plan is to keep going with my life but text them again a week from now and maybe continue doing that for 2-3 months or until they tell me to stop. I don't want them to feel overloaded with my messages and push them away but I do want to keep the idea in their head that I'm still here and want to be with them.

So I enjoy journaling for a few different reasons and as I continue to do it and get better at it the more natural it feels allowing you to really make use of it and get something out of it. Before this recent journaling expedition I had NEVER journaled. Maybe stupid little doodles and quotes from songs or something in notebooks but not really journaling or for any real purpose. I was somewhat curious and interested in the idea as it had always been suggested to me by programs institutions therapists etc.. however I couldn't get past my biggest hurdle which was how to begin journaling without feeling really really silly or like some teeny girl in highschool writing about people she doesn't like or her crushes or whatever. It just felt awkward and silly. I debated on doing it for a while and I think one day I said to myself to just do it see how it goes and do it day after day or just twice a day even if all I write is a sentence or a gratitude or a to do list the idea was just to start doing it and developing the healthy habit.

When my parents asked him if he wants to go somewhere he just screamed no repeatedly at them. Sometimes when we come back home and I check up on him he told me he regretted it and said he's a horrible person.



I think he has a lot of pressure from my mom. She wants him to go to college in the medical or engineer field. It might be partially my fault too. My mom wanted me to be a nurse but I got a degree in art. Even my relatives told me ""you can't have 2 siblings in the creative field. There has to be a balance. Your brother should be in stem."" I asked my brother and he actually wants to be a writer. I feel bad I don't think I'm a good older sister (I'm 25). I focused on my own issues for a long time now.

My brother ended up yelling at me that I'm a failure because it took me 6 years to graduate got a useless degree and tons of job rejections.

47778,"Why should anyone care about me. I have nothing to offer to this world. I'm 27 never had a job or done anything to contribute to society. I did sort of OK at college (mainly studied IT Software) but even then I had no idea of what job I wanted what my career path would be. With this lack of guidance I tried to go to supported internship places for a few years (I'm always told that because of my autism I need support). They got me some internships at various places (cafe photography shop printer's shop charity shop) but I never felt useful. I always felt like I was too slow and in the way of the actual useful people there that were just trying to do their job.



Maybe I should seek help. I have done in the past I've had appointments with therapists. (I'm lucky enough to live in the UK with free healthcare. My deepest sympathies go to those who don't have this luxury and have to go into debt just to have someone to talk about their mental and emotional struggles) But because I'm so inarticulate and slow and my thoughts are so scattered it takes me a while to think of what to talk about and the sessions only allow so much time. So usually not that much comes of it and I leave feeling unsatisfied and what the therapist says to me usually don't really help which is my fault because I'm fucking beyond help. I sometimes tell my best friend what's wrong and she tries to help but this is basically just me using her as a therapist which is shitty of me and she's too nice to tell me to shut up and stop being so depressing all the time. I feel like this is driving her away which would be horrible because it would be extremely difficult for me to find new meaningful friendships. I'm not sure where I'd go to make friends and then there's the matter of me finding what to say and my voice... but the point I'm getting towards is I'm not sure why people should care. I struggle with depression but so do a lot of people. And those people probably actually have skills and the potential to actually do something with their life. I feel like it's selfish for me to feel like I deserve help. When people suggest things to me that might help me to feel better I never feel the motivation to actually do them. I'm stuck in my comfort zone I guess of just lying in bed occasionally playing video games when I can find the motivation to even do that eating and sleeping. I'm a completely useless person with nothing to offer society. I always have been. Why should anyone care about me? I should just be left to die.",Depression

It is attached deep in my mind inescapable. I want it to disappear. Please. Just make it stop I can not bear it. It cuts my heart the very fabric of the person that I am in half. I break into a thousand pieces only for every piece to break into a thousand peices again and again. There is nothing. I wake up reminded from that moment to the moment I sleep. I hurt myself by remembering him but forgetting him is worse. Weeks go by how can I live with this pain. Every day. Every day I think of joining him. But how could I do this to his sisters? I have been trapped in my life with no way out but to endure this unimaginable indescripable relentless constant real pain. My dreams are nightmares but at least I see him there. How can I let go? How can I let go of my baby? Please I just want him back. I just want to tell him how much I love him how much he meant to me. To take back all the bad things I did and give him all the good things. I just need see him once more. Please. Please just let me see him. I wake up. Sleep is the only place I find solace. Torturous solace. Every one moves on but how could they? I lost my world. Every part of me aches for completeness I never knew I needed. I stand up putting on the uniform that tells me I am part okay. Okay enough to live on. But it is a clowns costume and I sewed it myself. And I look around and people give me their well meaning words and remind me of the real world. Its ridicolous roles I have to get back to playing.

I feel that nothing in life matters and that life is some weird thing I can't relate to. I only live for sex gambling and money however those things don't even bring me happiness.

I've felt no attachment to anything or anyone recently. I'm applying for a job this week had a job before had some savings I just gambled $1k ate a steak dinner and burned the rest (only had like $9k). There was no turning point in my life where I suddenly didn't care about anything. Since I was a little kid I can always remember having schizophrenic episodes but was discredited as I was just a ""dumb kid"". I would always see shadow people and be irrationally scared of the dark and I would see monsters and just scream and cry silently. All the way until I was 14. Then I stopped paying attention to it and just realized if I didn't care then it doesn't matter. I had a girlfriend once. I was with her for a week we fucked once we went for 5 hours I just got up and left at one point. Never talked to her again. Hate my family but I'd do anything for them. I hate religion I hate politics I hate material things I hate people I hate consciousness I hate breathing I hate thinking I hate eating I hate sleeping. I hate life. I can so easily be anything I want in life that it becomes obsolete to try to live. Life is just creating problems and then finding the solution endlessly.

**EKKSTACY** ",Depression
47949,"Don't know what to do anymore Back when I was in high school I was struggling to make friends and didn't have the greatest of home lifes either (my parents argued all the time and at times when they had no form of release for their anger and frustration I would end up their verbal punching bag or in extremely rare cases physical action would be taken as well). Back then I was on a constant mental decline due to loneliness and solitude I constantly found my self in. In order to try and combat it I did theater programs run through my school. The high school I was at is know for their theatre programs as well as their music department. Though run by about 3-4 teachers the school was known for how much it did within the field. the shows had thousands of dollars spent on them each year the music students took trips to music competitions with everyother year taking them to a competition in NYC. I loved theatre even did quite well in it up until I was about 21 but it wasnt the environment of the school that got me into it. It was the fact that all the students seemed to friends with each other. Casts of the school shows seemed like familys at times and with my home life the way it was I wanted something like that. So I joined the select choir that led to me being subtly hinted at to audition for the schools shows (well as subtle as people in that field could be). I did so hoping to join the family they created and got into the shows and was a part of the cast every year. now long story short I was never accepted fully into their family it was those teenage years where they had already determined friend groups but it allowed me time away from home for as many hours as possible. So some days with rehearsals or performances I would be at the school starting at 7 am until 11 pm. So I dedicated myself to the shows they were the one thing that really kept me going. Cut my senior year I was known for being a bad student amongst my peers. I never did homework because I would be too depressed at home to do it so many teachers would yell at me in front of other students in attempts to get me to improve my habits. None of it worked though mostly due to the fact that test scores could easily out weigh a students homework score to create a passing grade and with me never really getting below a 90 percent on any test it led me to focus on theatre instead. I loved it at this point the fall semester I was planning to audition for colleges and try to make a career out of this. Not only that but my school vocal director who doubled as the musical director chose a show we were gonna be dumping money into. I mean I think the show spent around 200k fabrics imported for India a large bell was made so it could be rung on stage without making a sound costumes rented from the former professional touring production it was a lot. I was excited for the year my fellow seniors were all really talented and it felt like for once I had a piece of the future to look forward to even if it was only 6 months worth of future. It didn't last long though. before the call back list was posted one day many of us were hanging out in the vocal directors classroom one girl was sitting behind the desk of the director since it was the most comfortable chair there when she started going though some of the directors things. When pressed about it she said she was looking to see if her boyfriend at the time had made it into the show if he didn't then she'd have to do her senior show without him. Another guy started to help her out of what I could only assume to be a mixture of bordem and curiosity when they stumbled apon a mock call back list as well as peoples rating for their auditions. the guy realized that they shouldn't be doing this and backed away to talk to others while the girl looked around asking others to look at it all for her. I wanted friends so I did. I told her that her boyfriend had a good audition and when other students pressed me about out it we talked about the call back list. The director eventually found out that people were going through her desk and when she asked other students about it they all said I had done it in search of the call back list. None of them said that anything about the other two students they didn't tell her how I just read out what they had found they placed everything on me. I don't know why they all did this I dont think I ever will but it led to the director to looking to see if I had done anything else. Apparently at this point other students had claimed that I said that a girl wasn't in the call back list and it saddened her to the point of tears first off that was wrong because I distinctly remember saying that she had a damn good chance to get the leading role along with everyone else on that list for it. She was and still is extremely talented and I've never claimed anything else. Next these students said I read the transcript of a math class for another student and bullied them for it. Now with this I did read this transcript the student had left it out on a table in the vocal classroom for about 2-3 weeks and one day I picked up and read it made a comment about to to other students in the room and put it back on the table it was. Unknown to me at the time that student had dropped out hence why he never came to retrieve the paper and why itd been there so long. I know the entirety of that situation because I had reached out to him to apologize when people started to blame me for him dropping out. He told me it was fine and didn't know what was happening because he made and followed through on that decision far before any of this happened. Unfortunately for me though the director only heard that the student dropped out and that I according to others had bullied him. She pulled me aside one day to tell me how disappointed she was in me she told me how she knew everything I'd done and that there's no reason to attempt to lie about anything. She said I was the reason that kid dropped out and that I robbed her of the chance to save him she said I violated her trust by going through what must have been all of her things to find the audition information and she said that she couldn't believe I would lie to people and tell others that a girl wasn't up for a role where she really was. I didn't know what to do the director what certain in what she knew and I knew she wasn't changing her mind on any of it so I just through tears said I was sorry that I didn't mean to hurt anyone. The director was like a mother to me and now she was pinning all these things to me and I didn't know what to do. So as punishment she wanted me to apologize to the girl I was to never be in her classroom without her being there and that she couldn't in good faith help me with any college auditions. She finished it all off by saying that because of this all she didn't know if she could ever trust me again. It broke me I isolated myself for the rest of the school year she thankfully still let me be in the show that year but I tried to not talk to many people at rehearsals if I wasn't spoken to first. I applied for other degree fields at colleges. And outside of school I rarely spoke to anyone unless it was online gaming.
I didn't perform for over year after that I couldn't get myself to be near a stage. I eventually got the courage to audition for the theatre department at the college I attended and got in. But after a year and a half the anxiety of being around a stage and performing and the anxiety that I would just be someone's scape goat or disappointment again led to major problems for me. I developed a severe panic attack and anxiety disorder and my body would start literally breaking down under the stress of it all leading at points to trips to the ER for internal bleeding. I quit performing for good after that I haven't been on a real stage since I was 19 and I haven't performed since I was 21. I'm 23 now and I don't know what to do I had to drop out of college because of my mental health my father has threatened to kick me out of the house because my choice to leave school and when my mother opposed his idea threatened to divorce her and list me as the cause.im stuck in a deadend job working 60 hours a week and I've lost all will to do anything.

She came into my room while I was crying and was yelling at me. I told her to get out with swearing involved because I was really stressed out and upset. She then wouldn't and she kept getting right up into my face as if she was going to start throwing hands at me. I then was starting to involve talks of myself going to hurt myself she then said that she doesn't know what I was on about and got really defensive. I then said can you just give me 5 minutes to breath and then I will come speak with her after going back and forward for about 15 minutes she finally left me alone and I shut my door and dragged my dresser in front of it. I then had a full on panic attack for a solid 15 minutes and I could barely breath and I was smacking my head onto my wall and on my desk. She then came back to my room after she had sit in the lounge and listen to it all happen while she was sitting there watching TV. She came back and was back into a calm state herself which is quite a normal thing for her and she came in my room and comforted me. I kept breaking into tears while she was talking to my cat. After the situation she calmed me down after about 30 minutes of a continued panic attack.

August 2022 I started to get brain zaps/dizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start. I worked my way up to 75mg &amp; started to feel a lottttt better but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since. Very dizzy lots of anxiety &amp; panic attacks and the weird uncontrollable emotions/thoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since.

I have a roommate currently. I am originally from the sf Bay Area and while I loved it there I needed a change . Weather for one thing and LA just seemed so exciting and it is . Anyway I moved here in 2018 and love it . So I’m happy in the city I live in but I’m not happy with the circumstances of the last two years and instead of looking back I’m trying to look forward and realize my lie isn’t over and boring and useless.

I work retail so those who work it or have will know exactly what I’m talking about. So in 2022 I tried to restart by going back to being a vegetarian forcing myself to go back to the gym etc but my motivation is just not there yet .

I have often had issues with asking women out etc. it’s weird maybe I am incel yet I don’t blame my problems on women I blame it all on myself that I’m my own worst enemy. I tend to shoot myself in the foot . It’s weird because I don’t consider myself repressed. I grew up in a liberal household in San Francisco. I also am not a right winger as most incels are . I am liberal . Anyways so most men can ask a woman out with no problem and nothing would faze them . I on the other hand have trouble because I don’t want to make a fool of myself come off as creepy etc . Good example is there is this customer at work who I like and comes in most everyday . Her and I talk quite a bit when I’m helping her and we smile at each other . And I think she likes me but probably just being friendly. Two of my colleagues know I like her and always ask “ Have you asked her out yet “ I always give an excuse or that she wouldn’t want to have anything to do with me that way. So other guys could just ask a woman out with no issue but not me. Also I’m not at my best right now and want to get back to being healthy and exercise. The funny thing is I can talk to beautiful women because I do every day because I work in Beverly Hills and I can engage and be friendly but on my own I don’t seek out to talk to women because of my own fear as how they view me.

34276,"Rabies Anxiety - Long Term Incubation I'm not sure how many of you are familiar with rabies as the subject of your health anxiety but one of the worrisome things about it is that there have been documented cases where the incubation period after exposure to the virus has been years and years as high as 25 years in one case (although the evidence for it is not definite). A few other examples of long incubation periods include 4 - 6 years and around 15. My fear here is that despite not having rabies yet I am incubating this terrifying virus and will ultimately die from encephalitis and insanity which is the outcome of all rabies diagnoses.
11 years and 8 months ago I handled two baby raccoons over a period of days my aunt found in her yard after her dog killed the mother. We kept them for probably 3 days and I would imagine my aunt had them for 2 or 3 days as well before we gave them to a local animal hospital which gave them to a local wildlife rehabilitation center before release. After dropping them off with the clinic we never heard anything else from them. My father confirmed with me yesterday that he left his contact information. I called them yesterday and they don't have documentation about it that far back but the woman on the phone was not exactly reassuring because apparently a local unlicensed person was doing the rehabilitation back then. Still it's someone who would have had the animals in their care for a period of time that would have seen anything to indicate rabies.I don't recall the animals behaving strangely but that doesn't say much. I also don't recall being scratched to show blood (maybe some white-marking from their little claws but no deep contact) and if they did get saliva on me I don't imagine it was on an open wound. My aunt father two neighborhood friends have not gotten rabies. We never heard anything back from the animal hospital. The only report of raccoon rabies is from 2003 before this happened in 2006. In that county in 2006 there was only one documented case of raccoon rabies in the wild (not humans). For the length of time we had the animals we would have seen some sort of odd behavior.

So today at work I go normally to the restroom and strech my groin since ot was feeling a bit stiff. While feeling the groin with my hand I notice a bump and freak out completely. It's about 2cm long and quite narrow. My first thought is obviously lymphoma. I mean how could it not be... I haven't been sick since the first week of January so it can't have swollen on it's own right?? Then I connect the weird feelings in my stomach during the last three weeks to the bump and the anxiety is back all guns blazing.How do I move on from here?Tl;dr/summary
185cm tall and 65kg skinny. Noticed a new bump in my left groin it does not hurt but is quite hard and about 2cm long and narrow. I have previously noticed two other lymph nodes one in each groin and they feel similar but slightly larger. The only reason why I think its a swollen lymph node is because I haven't noticed it earlier (I dont check my groins very often).Edit. I think its important to note that I started a new job in a warehouse two weeks ago. I lift boxes stand and walk the whole day so my muscles are very tense all the time. Could this have something to do with the bump",Anxiety

2 weeks ago I was in and out of the hospital for some strep throat complications which has completely peaked my anxiety. I’m only 19 and I’m indoors most of the time and have no family history of Melanoma but I can’t help but freak out. They’re very tiny one is small and brown but the other may not even be a mole? It’s the same size but red and not raised. No pain or itching. It’s just making me paranoid.

6 or 7 years ago I felt a huge discomfort around my abdominal belt so much that almost had to sleep standing up because it was the most confortable position for me I went to a doctor and he shoved his hand in my lower stomach so hard I screamed in pain he said it was appendicitis even though the pain was coming from him and him only and he rushed me to the hospital. After a day of stress they announce me that i'm fine and that I just have to take some medication because there was a problem with my nose for some reason.Because of that experience any small tingling sensation in my stomach puts me in a state of anxiety my heart rushed i feel heat around my head I want to throw up and I have diarrhea which are common symptoms for appendicitis so i end up in a vicious circle.I've been suffering from anxiety and depression for a while now and i'm pretty inactive at the moment I'm a lot on my computer but ever since too weeks i've been feeling stomach discomfort for sitting too long which triggered my anxiety through the roof and messed up my digestive system going from constipation to diarrhea every few days I also suffer from lower back pain.

I've been on allergy medication but it hasn't really helped.
2 blood tests have shown that I have low white blood cell count and I have had a round of antibiotics but it didn't help.

34616,"Pressure on head likely due to stress and anxiety but knowing this doesn't make it go away. Hey everybody
20 yo Male here.To give a little rundown for the past year or so whenever I have any sort of problem with my body I tend to assume the worst and can't stop thinking about the issue until I get 100% confirmed of the problem and that it is solvable. A good representation of this was in December I thought I was having heart palpitations and it really stressed me out. Long story short and a few doctors visits later I had an ultrasound of my heart and I passed with flying colors where there were no signs of any problem with my heart. After that day my heart did not flutter once and hasn't really since because if I ever start to get to that point I remember the ultrasound and how good it was and the problem will cease. More recently however my lower right abdominal was hurting and after some googling (which I know is bad for me but I still do anyway) I believed it could be appendicitis. So I did my classic worrying and got some bloodwork done and a CT scan and there was classically no issue to worry about. A few days later with some medication the gut problems went away but then I had my first nosebleed in a few years. I live in upstate New York so this should not be an uncommon thing but it spiraled into something very aggravating.This is where we address my current issue which is a pressure on my head that is likely some sort of tension headache. The pain level in my head is extremely low probably around a 1 but I can tell all the muscles in my neck/shoulders are now tense. I have been doing my classic Googling and I'm certain that all these symptoms I have been getting are solely due to anxiety and stress but knowing that isn't taking away any of the tension in my head. This problem has caused me to have trouble falling asleep making me wake up in the middle of the night and waking up much earlier than I would want to. Last night it felt as though I just laid there and didn't sleep at all but I'm sure I likely did. I am now on a more or less sleep schedule of trying to go to bed around 1 am not being able to until 2:30 am then rising for morning at about 7:30 am. This whole process is likely what is causing my stress but is also something that is tough to conquer due to my stress. I have started to work out recently and usually after hitting the gym I am feeling ""normal"" for a little while but right when I wake up my symptoms manifest and it's back to this anxious version of myself.I am not sure what I am hoping to come of writing this maybe I just want someone to tell me that what is happening is solely due to my stress/anxiety so I can affirm that even further. Or maybe I want somebody to reciprocate with me and tell me they went through the same thing and let me know how they got through it. Right now it just seems like a constant cycle that is very tough to break but I'm hopeful for the future.Hope everyone has a great day and thanks for any help.",Anxiety
34629,"Anxiety/Antsy 2 weeks Post-Op Septoplasty/Turbinate Reduction - Need Support Hi all! First time poser here. I am a healthy 28 y/o Male who recently just had a Septoplasty/Turbinate reduction 15 days ago. I am a very active guy and usually very ""chill"" and outgoing. For those of you who don't know what that is it's for a deviated septum and you have splints up your nose for a week with a ton of congestion and basically can't do anything while recovering but sit at home (I live by myself with family close by). Due to the surgery I was instructed to not be super active for 2-3 weeks (I am a runner and take boxing classes). So far my nose and breathing feels fine and is healing normally but the past few days I have been experiencing super anxiety/restlessness/antsy behavior that I have never experienced before in my life. Let me explain a bit.
8 days ago I got the ""splints"" removed from my nose and had a minor complication the day after where my nose bled for 5-6 hours and I went to the ER and they packed it with the most painful ""rhino rocket"" thing up my nose that was the most pain I have experienced in my life. I immediately saw my ENT 6 hours later and she took it out and was pissed they didn't contact her (it was 3am). She said everything looks fine and is healing correctly and gave me the number to call if anything like that happens so she can be contacted.I got relief that day and was able to take a nap/sleep but the next day I got a migraine I tried to wait out that kept me up all night but ended up taking my imitrex to relieve it. A few days later I got oral thrush (didn't know until the end of the day on Sunday when my Uncle told me what it was an not super serious) with a swollen uvula where I felt as if there was ""something stuck in my throat"" and driving me crazy.On Sunday I think everything just hit me at once: not being able to workout being cooped up in my house the whole trauma of the bloody nose incident the swollen uvula driving me nuts and not healing as fast as I wanted to living alone with my dog etc. I started pacing and my mind was racing to the point where I was like do I need to go to the ER for anxiety or do I need to call my doctor? I have no history of anxiety/depression and have never felt this way before. I am not even close to suicidal thoughts or any self-harm. I was able to sit with my Dad and talk for a few hours while watching the Red Sox then have Sunday dinner at my grandma's with my whole family and that helped a lot and by the end of Sunday/Monday I was feeling better (though the oral thrush is still annoying).Today I had some restlessness/anxiety at work that started resurfacing again like on Sunday but talked to a co-worker who used to struggle big time with it for a bit. Is this normal after surgery? Any thoughts/recommendations/words of encouragement?",Anxiety

34788,"I've been making a fool of myself for the past month This is going to be long sorry. I just really wanted to let this all out and I figured this is the best place to do it.I've always had a little bit of health anxiety but it typically subsided very quickly. It was never something that had an effect on my life until recently.One night in early December I was playing a video game for several hours and barely moved. Eventually I had a pain shooting up my left leg and it appeared to be swollen. My mom suggested I pinched a nerve but I just knew it was a blood clot. My symptoms were a mild pain in my leg and ""swelling"" Google told me I was about to die and I was thoroughly convinced.A few days pass of me obsessing over this. I read about DVT for hours every single day. I'm basically an expert on it at this point. I know all about taking blood thinners and the effect it could have on your period. I was preparing myself for this life.I measured my legs to compare them many times a day. This had me believing the ""swelling"" wasn't going down. Turns out the left side of me is just fatter than the other half and I never noticed it because the difference is literally less than a cm. Was I *ever* swelling? No idea. My mom measured her own legs to show me a difference in the size of your legs was normal which only kind of comforted me. Briefly wondered if she too was dying and didn't know it.Somewhere around this time I thought I had sleep apnea because one night my anxiety was so bad that I was jolting awake every time I started dozing off. This fear faded pretty quickly since my obvious blood clot was my biggest priority.After those few days passed my anxiety finally won the battle and I went to the ER. Shocking news: I did not have a blood clot in my leg. I thought this confirmation would make me feel better and it did for a few days. But my (mild barely noticeable) leg pain persisted and after all my DVT research I decided I was among the extremely rare few who had an inaccurate ultrasound reading.
6 days after the first ER visit I had an excruciating muscle spasm in my leg. Surely the blood clot has moved up into my thigh I thought. This was accompanied by my lower back feeling like it was on fire and the fiery pain radiating down into my leg. My mom once again suggested a pinched nerve. I was in hysterics at this point so I ignored her and went back to the ER.They did another ultrasound. It was negative. I had sciatica. Started googling that to make sure it could cause the symptoms I had (it can). The pain was goddamn miserable but I wasn't going to die.You'd think at this point I'd be good but my mind had other plans. I developed a cough. Welp the blood clot was real and must have traveled to my lungs. I'm dealing with a pulmonary embolism now and death is imminent. I believed this for a few days before finally accepting that it was fucking ridiculous.So after about 3 weeks of this hell I finally moved on from my blood clot obsession and just focused on healing the sciatica. Had a nice 2 weeks or so of feeling like I was back to normal mentally until this week.I had a pain in my lower abdomen. Convinced myself it was a kidney infection. Didn't start off assuming a mostly harmless UTI (or literally any of the many other things that could cause abdominal pain) nah I went right for the hard hitter. This one could kill me it's gotta be that one. I considered appendicitis too.It was constipation.I was hopeful that my life would go back to normal after the whole blood clot disaster but now I'm worried that it was just the beginning. I *knew* I was being ridiculous when I diagnosed myself with a kidney infection but there was still that voice in the back of my head saying ""but what if..."". I was still researching still getting worked up about it. I don't want to be like this. It's humiliating and exhausting.",Anxiety
34928,"Anyone ever had lung/chest sounds? Would really appreciate your insight. I read a lot of the posts here and I nod along and think ‘Yeah that’s me.’ But this is my first time posting as I’m looking for some input and would be grateful for your thoughts.
2018 was a busy year for me. I got married (and I’m very happy aside from the crippling HA) I run my own business and I’m fully self-employed. I lost 20 pounds doing a 10 week intense gym course and I got wait for it 8 colds. HA nightmare.I’m a 31 year old male and healthy (except for that undiagnosed illness that changes every month but is surely secretly killing me) but getting the cold 8 times last year really set my HA on a spiral. That’s not the only “illness” I had last year. I had mouth ulcers and sore throats that I thought were somehow HIV. I had a sore on my tongue that at the time had to have been tongue cancer. I had a pain in my lower back which radiated into my testicles and down my left leg which of course had to have been testicular cancer (saw the doc twice about this - no meds given) You all know the story all of these things cleared up and I moved onto the next killer.Anyway I went and got my bloods tested yesterday and I’m awaiting results next week. I did this because I got so many colds last year and also I want to see what’s slowly “killing me”. But my new symptom scares me. It a sound when I breathe deep. Like a bubbling or a mild rattling. Only sometimes maybe around ten breathes a day some days less some days none. I am getting over a series of colds as I mentioned. And I also have a tickley cough. It’s not chesty. And sometimes I cough of clear snot with it (sorry) I had this exact same episode Summer 2018 with the sounds etc and it all cleared up but has returned after a winter cold and it just won’t go away. Obviously I’m thinking lung cancer or that I’ll need a lung transplant etc I went to the doc but because the sound/sensation is only there sometimes he listened and said my lungs sound Chrystal clear. I wanted a chest x ray but he said he didnt see grounds for one at that point (a month ago)Has anyone had any breathing sounds with anxiety? Like deep in your chest? Has anyone had stress/anxiety cause extra mucus that could maybe cause such a thing?Would really love some input on this. Thanks in advance! TL:DR: Having sounds in my lungs every so often when taking a deep breath. Anyone have this and live to tell the tale? ",Anxiety

I've been like this my whole life. I don't even know why but ever since I've been a kid I've been worried about my health. I was a semi sick child but nothing life threatening or horrible. I have been seeing a therapist off and on since I've been 14 and it does help though I haven't gone in a few weeks.
2 months ago I began getting vertigo. Doctor told me it was an inner ear problem and the whole thing made my anxiety completely spiral out of control. I haven't stopped thinking about whats wrong with me or worried about not being dizzy for longer than 15 minutes in the last 10 weeks. The room spinning vertigo is gone I'm just left with some random dizzy spells and disequilibrium/unsteadiness. I was convinced the doctor missed something so they agreed to do some blood work and booked an MRI. They don't seem overly concerned but said they will do it. I'm waiting for the MRI but just got news back from my bloodwork. Apparently it's all normal expect for my B12 which is elevated (cut off is 950 and I'm 1048).. This is pretty unusual since B12 is normally low if anything. I have been taking B12 supplements so I'm going to try to assume that's what caused it (the nurse told me about the blood results and the doctor has yet to follow up so I don't know what to do about it besides stop taking the supplement) but of course my crazy self went on Google and found out high B12 can be indicative of blood or liver cancers and is really serious. Cue freak out. I'm just done. I'm so done living like this. I don't know what the follow up will be for the B12 if anything but I'm just going to be sitting here wanting to browse the internet in hopes of making myself feel better when in reality I never will. I will sit here and think about every bodily sensation and worry about feeling off balance and worry about something sinister going on and picturing all the horrible scenarios that are going to happen and how I'm going to die young and suffer and leave my children motherless. &amp;#x200B;I just have to make a change. Even if I do have blood cancer or liver cancer (my current fear) there isn't anything I can do about it. It's not like worrying is going to make it go away so why do I do this to myself?

I've booked an appointment with my psychologist for this Wednesday and I am vowing to myself to get off Google and never go back on for answers.

8 months ago I had a viral infection which has since caused whatever chronic condition or disease I have.\-Just want to add my viral infection started with a bad stomach/lower abdomen ache 1-2 days before the actual infection (8 months ago) and I had a rapid heart-rate from right at the start of the viral infection.My symptoms are:\-Just want to start off by saying my heart-rate was high right from the very start of whatever infection i got like from day 1.\-Tachycardia through-out the day. Little things make my heart race (whereas before I was very fit) I wear a fit-bit and my heart-rate is very normal in the 60s when I am sleeping. But in the day time when I am out even if I am just seating my heart-rate is constantly around 110 BPM. And if I have anxiety it can easily go up to 140. And if I for example climb the stairs or jump around a bit my heart-rate shoots up to 150 and if I go for a short jog (I can't because of my heart) but in 1 minute it is nearly 180 BPM. Due to how fast it beats I do not take part in any exercise. I had normal Echocardiogram and EKG.. but I did that 5 months ago. I want to point out for some reason when I am with my family at home my heart-rate is also normal if I am just seating. And it was also normal when I visited my cousins and when I was in their house again just sitting.Recently I had to attend a science lab for my university and even though I was sitting my heart-rate was consistently around 110-125.\-My systolic blood pressure has been evaluated since this chronic condition.. at 130-140 but my diastolic pressure has remained 80.\-Lately my chest feels more pressure and stress and I think its because I put alot of strain on my heart throughout the duration of this whole thing. I visited a cardiologist 5 months ago and he said my heart everything was good.\-For the past few days it feels if I breath in very deeply my heart hurts but not really sure where the pain is coming from\-My only blood abnormality is a very high B12 at more than double the upper limit 1476 pmol/L. I have measured homocysteine just now and it was in the normal range at 9 umol/L. Not really sure why my B12 is very high as I am not taking supplements and am a vegetarian.My hands (for nearly 8 months) have blue veins appearing on the finger. very similar to the hand in this photo (but on the finger as-well): [https://imgur.com/a/n5V1XjC](https://imgur.com/a/n5V1XjC) .\- I had muscle twitching and tingling which happened alot through-out the day it has since gone down but the tingling and twitching still happen at times. I had a normal EMG.\- Leg muscles have gotten much weaker according to my wall-sit time and squatting. Prior to 8 months I could easily do a wall sit for 3 minutes now after 20 seconds my legs feel unbearably sore and they are shaking like crazy right away when I start a wall sit.NORMAL TESTS AND RESULTS (all this are from several months ago except the blood results posted above those are from today. ): Normal: TSH Blood CBC LDH ESR CRP PROTEIN ELECTROPHORESIS abdomen ultrasound Echocardiogram EMG test urine analysis EBV bicarbonate chloride creatinine AST/ ALT Potassium.ABNORMAL RESULTS: Very high Blood B12: 1475 pmol/L (range is 200-600 pmol/L). Slightly low Iron and Vitamin D. I do NOT take any B12 supps when it was measured high and I am also a vegetarian.To summarize: I feel I have some type of post-viral autoimmune disease which causes High B12 Tachycardia anxiety and high-normal Neutrophils and monocytes.

2 weeks ago I was spinning out chest pains shortness of breath pains in arms you get the gist. I’m sure you all understand the downward spiral of HA.The weekend prior to that I went to an event and had purchased a new bra turns out it was a wee bit ill fitting and I was uncomfortable in it but didn’t think much of it.Turns out ill fitting bras can mimic heart attack pains and my shoulders and arms hurt because the straps were too tight. I felt like a moron. Anyway an entire week of worrying crying you name it. My bra ended up being too tight. Wow. ",Anxiety
35327,"Its funny how HA works Lately we've had a small problem with rats behind one of our walls at home. We through some poison into the hole in which they climb. No biggie.So today my dog was being more friendly and excited than usual. My fiance and I spent some time playing with her since he was in such a good mood. She licked my face a ton while we were playing (the dog not my fiance lol).
5 minutes after she calmed down my fiance eventually said ""did she catch a rat or something?"". Instantly I realized that if she did she might have been poisoned by the poisoned rat and her licking could have poisoned me. I was fine until I thought of that. Suddenly I got dizzy and nauseous. HA works like that. Unless we have the idea we don't worry about our health. Our symptoms are caused from our overactive brains. But I'm sure you knew this already.

Apparently it wont effect him till his old but what the hell !Straight down the rabbit hole googling away... heart pumping i bet i have leukemia im certain i don’t know what else it could be...I have NO symptoms of why it could be swollen and the worst thing is i don’t really know how long its been like that for i just felt it while rubbing my neck one day about the size of a cashew..Anyone had a swollen lymph node on there right side that turned out not to be leukemia..😒",Anxiety

Well...I've tried I caught up with old friends made some new ones actually have some hope for the future for the first time in a long time even been trying to get a girlfriend (I'm 22 and have never had one). Turns out my health anxiety hates this I'm not allowed to be happy because to be happy is to be excited for the future something that's hard to do when your thoughts are once again racing with things you thought you had moved past. Why would I go out to the bar with friends if I'm dying why am I mixing up words when typing why is my leg suddenly jerking frequently why am I even feeling motivated and confident is this finally the personality changes that come with having a brain tumour. Anxiety is cruel but this is the cruelest thing it has done yet preventing my ability to be happy because what's the point I'll obviously be dead soon. And you know what set me off tonight? I sat down on the toilet and noticed a drop of liquid on the seat. Was it there before I sat down or did it leak out without me noticing?

35484,"Shortness of breath that just won’t go away Age: 19Male
220lbsJust for some context I’ve been feeling this constantly since December and since October I’d say I’ve had pretty bad health anxiety after finding multiple lumps under my skin. In November I went to a dermatologist to get them all checked out and the dermatologist said they were all lipomas and nothing to worry about but health anxiety forgets about that after a week and ever since then I’ve been scared of the potential of those lumps being sarcoma cancer. I’m not sure if this is what is causing my shortness of breath as the shortness of breath never goes away it’s there 24/7. Yesterday I went to a walk in clinic to get examined for my shortness of breath and the doctor noticed a slight wheeze which sent me into a spiral of health anxiety as me thinking I have sarcoma I thought it might’ve spread to the lungs or something. Anyways he does some tests to see the power of my exhale (don’t remember what it’s called) and then gives me abeuterol and tries the text again. I got the same results but he said when he checked my breathing after the wheeze was gone. So in short is this shortness of breath from anxiety or could it be a very minor case of asthma? The doctor also got a chest X-ray done and said everything looked normal.",Anxiety

I had a very rough year. Professionally I didn't get along with my old teaching team and they turned our kids against me. Principal got involved and was on my side it was ugly. So I finished my first year of teaching and now my second year is going much better but the end of that first year was miserable.
2017 was not my friend.I saw an idea on Facebook to put a note in a jar each week that has one good thing that happened that week on each note then at the end of the year look at all of the great things that happened.

45911,"7 years later: tales from an SO Hey all. A whiiiiiiile back I had a really rough week. And I [wrote about it here.](https://np.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/fy8mx/its_a_long_story_but_i_need_to_tell_it/)Well I just wanted to say:LIFE IS FUCKING GRAND.Yeah Chris has bipolar. Yeah his medications suck. But he's up again. He's doing again. This isn't a sudden thing either this has been slow and gradual and we wouldn't want it any other way; as if we had it faster that's... bad news.But... our relationship is better than it's ever been. I stuck through the worst of things and honestly the worst was only about 1-2 years. (Only. I know that's a long time but seriously compared to eternity it's nothing.) During that 1-2 years time I basically had lost all hope and was only driven by my promise and loyalty to my husband. Promises that were hard to keep because he seemed like such a doppelganger.We kept adjusting medications. We lowered stress in our lives. I took over on all the hard stuff and I give Chris whatever latitude I can. I've lost my judgementality. Chis still judges himself very strongly and I am trying to help him be less critical. He's come a long way but he wants to help more and I think this is a good sign. He just needs to be more patient with himself.About 4 years ago he had another psychotic break. This was while he was medicated. But the problem was we were moving. The stress of this put him over; it's something that happens. But the second time was much milder much easier. Firstly everything was set up so we had a p-doc (The best thank you Madeline god thank you so god damned much) and he had medication and he was able to recognize the discrepancies. The first time through he had no idea something had gone wrong in his head. But this time he DID and it made a HUGE difference. ([Here's where I wrote about it](http://www.pushypixels.com/post/122389851999/missing-the-man-who-is-there) at one point sorry the picture is missing my hosting screwed up; I'll have to fix that later.)Anyway that was much milder and cleared up in a few months.So all sounds pretty bad-ish not GRAND like I claim but seriously let's step back and look at things specifically this statement:&gt; During that 1-2 years time I basically had lost all hopeI. Had. Lost. All. Hope.I had lost the LOVE OF MY LIFE. He was gone. I was resigned to caring for his shell for the rest of my days. I even... god help me... I even wished for his death. Or my own.And NOW I HAVE HIM BACK.There are no words I can write to explain the magnitude of this. None. All the worldly troubles I've ever had have MELTED in the face of this tragedy. All of them.Anyway hope this was worth a little read. Chris will be waking up soon and I am gonna cuddle him back into bed the moment he does! &lt;3

So since mid January I've been..I don't really know how to describe what it's been like. Definetly been up and down. I didn't end up creating this throwaway until I cut myself I dont even remember when a few days ago or last week I dont know anymore. I just get so confused and disoriented whenever I try to figure out what's happening. I've just been crying and then being happy and then wanting to die and cutting myself and enjoying times with friends and sobbing because my friends hate me. Alot of crying and confusion I guess. It all started about maybe mid January ? I just remember not being able to speak up to my family (I'm 16) since it was my brothers birthday soon. Now it's my birthday in a few days. When I'm at my best I'm drawing (all I ever do really) and watching but not listening to things. A sort of list of some stuff: crying constantly eating constantly and feeling extremely hungry sleeping at 9am until 6 pm having trouble recalling events and feeling disoriented and confused alot I was already paranoid before but it's been even heightened now seeing larger things that aren't there than usual feeling extremely insecure alllll the time and doubting and hating myself and feeling as if everyone I care about hates me and feeling guilty I'm like this stopping doing everything I love (aka art) because I just can't bring myself to do anything but play cookie run and listen to videos being tired all the time from crying and not sleeping not being able to focus barely thinking about wanting to die when it gets really bad being extremely short and snappy with my family because hearing them speak to me is irritating me so bad I get so unreasonably angry Ionly moving to eat and having even more extreme memory issues (it's taken me a long time just to being it back into my head everything that's been going on).

Luckily Ive never been caught but Its only a matter of time. Some co-workers have even seen me hit the wall and throw objects work before. (Im usually quite jolly so they probably think Im nuts).

46696,"SO in need of help We have been together with break ups for 7 years.
2 years ago we moved for a fresh start but I feel it was to get me away from friends and family as all I have is him now. He also now has little support. I am scared for my safety and though I love him I can't do this to myself no more. I want children and a house and this feels like it'll never happen. We have moved countless times from him damaging the houses or putting us in financial debt that we are then kicked out. We have been homeless from him not being able to accept help and choosing drugs. My jobs have been comprised from him going into work and abusing me having police show up or I become sick from no sleep or malnourished or crazy depressed. He is in and out of work for his family but really is just a pay cheque and he never goes to work so has no routine. Especially now days. I've had many police involvements and hospitalized from them and other times. This past year and a half has been nothing but a downward spiral and I feel I am an enabler and he does better without me because he has to stand on his own two feet when I'm not there. I feel like a mother more than a partner. Our current house is trashed inside and out. Actual mess and filth to house damage aswell.He recently got out of hospital but his mania is still very high up. He spent all our pay on material things drugs and the likes and we now have to paid rent that I'm aware of for 2 weeks. He goes out at all hours night driving around and from this his car has been in multiple crashes but won't tell me any details so we can't get insurance. It's still half drivable but suspended and I'm worried of him driving my car. I have most of my belongings in my car as he has said he will light the house in fire before being hospitalized and did try. I am extremely mentally drainage from all this and the way I am spoken to constantly. I am walking on egg shells and get no sleep as he hardly sleeps and does many OCD things to wake me up like flicking lights rummaging through draws. Half organising or cleaning at inappropriate hours of the night. Physically waking me up to harrass me when his not driving around. I know his taken his meds and the hospital and docs just won't believe me that he isn't fine and his meds currently don't work anymore. I am sorry for the mess of this post. Hard to put 7 years of a very stressful realtionships in words and currently what's happening. How do I get out? I feel I have spent majority of the years trying so hard to help and also been a bad guy and an enabler which makes it hard too. But it gets harder and harder to see a future and happiness. I am scared he will try to hurt himself or follow me if I try. Any advice I'd be so greatful for. ",Bipolar
46923,"Questions for you people who are bipolar. Hey I'm actually not bipolar but my ex-girlfriend is and I had some questions regarding the disorder. I hope that this is allowed on this subreddit if it isn't then I'm sorry.We dated for 2 years. Before we got together she was in a manic episode and then afterwards we got together. At this point I didn't even know that she was bipolar. She had social anxiety schizophrenia and depressions the same as me so we worked perfectly together. We would sit at home playing videogames and were just enjoying the company of the other person. Then her life changed. She finally found the motivation to get into a new class and I think this is what triggered the manic episode. She was suddenly a complete other person she spent like 1000$ (all she had) on creative things and new hobbies. She was really outgoing which I wasn't used to at all. And then it happened. She met with another guy. Then she met a second time with him. Until then I just thought she is finally making friends but then she cancelled a date with me to go out partying with the guy and another friend of hers. That was the moment I realised something was seriously wrong. We had a talk. She didn't cheat but she also made it pretty clear that she does not want the relationship anymore. I asked her why and she couldn't even give me an answer. She tried to explain it by ""feeling like she is trapped in a cage."" and I first thought that she meant she wants sex with other guys but no. She told me she misses the time from before the relationship (her last manic episode). And yes I know that it sounds like she cheated but she didn't I know this for a fact.Even more things happened. She proposed the idea of a 1 month relationship break (without cheating). I agreed. And I think that was the time where the manic episode manifested itself completely.After 1 month I texted her and her response clearly showed me that there is no spark of common sense left in her. She didn't care about anything anymore. She straight up told me that she knew 3 weeks ago already that it won't work. She told me she is currently at a restaurant with another guy and she will bring him with her later to pick up her stuff. When she arrived she had completely new clothes a new haircut tons of make-up.BUT I also knew that she did not do any of this to hurt me. It was pretty obvious that she didn't really have a clue what her actions did anymore. It was almost like a child that just wants to have fun and that doesn't even realise how his actions affect other people.
1 week later I visited her parents to get back my stuff and they just cried and told me they don't know what's wrong with her and that she is behaving really weirdly lately.So now my questions for you guys : What will happen once her manic episode is over ? Will she feel regret and shame ? And what can I do to prevent that ? She tried to commit suicide multiple times in the past and I'm almost sure that once she realises what she has done that she will do it again. And the last times I was there for her but I'm scared that she is too ashamed to contact me this time. After the break up I texted her that she can contact me anytime but I'm not sure if she will do it. I mean what happens to you guys once the manic episode is over ? And especially what happens when the manic episode started like this ?",Bipolar

3 weeks ago I switched to a different SSRI and I started having symptoms like anxiety panic ruminating over that experience and feeling worthless which I think were withdrawal symptoms from the old drug (lexapro) I noticed that these symptoms come when there is something wrong with the medication or I am going through a stressful time.I got a panic attack at work and my manager noticed and when I asked for some time off to recover they stalled and then they released an exit visa from the country and told me I would work remotely from my home country but there is no guarantee that they would keep their word. So now I am faced with the possibility of going back to my country which is going through a tough time economically and uncertainty about finding a new job.

All i wish is to lie in bed all day and stare at the wall.I opened this thread because lately i have more and more thoughts like ""whats the point of this? why do this another 60years?"" and after another successful ski weekend with family i just prefered to stay in bed after skiing for 10min.&amp;#x200B;Its not something that just started to happen a few weeks ago. It follows me since childhood i would say. Nothing ever motivated or brought me joy me except computer games as kid but not even games nowadays bring me joy at all. Somehow i got through all schools till university without doing anything and missing about 20% of classes. Even in university my motvation is still equal 0 and thus I am still stuck in bachelor after 6years.I write exams from time to time because i guess thats something you have to do in life but my motivation is negativ. But when Ifind a tiny bit of motivation to write an exam I usually write very good grades while not attended 1 class at uni over all these years but they dont make me happy nor motivate me for more.But its definitely not the issue with the chosen path. I tried different part time jobs like char mech hotelero(?) sales (not retail) vet or logistics. ZERO motivation for any of it. It always started fine while I kept up my mask but usually after few weeks I couldn't find motivation to stand up anymore and quit. But also here they usually were happy with me and few even called me year later to help out again during summer holiday etc.I dont find any sports enjoyable. handballunihockeyskisailingboxing... tried and tried nothing lasted over a month except gym once because I thought all my problems are because of my physical appearance. Not even this gave me any motivation even though after intensive few months I got way more attention from women people treated me better and so on.

I had a few romances including two longer relationships which lasted 1years and 2years with very beautiful&amp;great character women. BUT the same problem again NO MOTIVATION.

Even now almost towards 30y they still meet multiple times per month and go on holiday 1-3 times /year since we are 18. even here NO MOTIVATION i usually join the holiday once a year but this is like enough. It is just not fun to me to hang out. No they are very good people alone for the fact they still ask me out even tho i go deep sea most of the year.

I think I'm gonna use it to get off drugs so I can fially move forward in my life. Cause right now I'm seriously not having a good time. I feel like this is my last chance to turn things around before my life devolves fully into chaos and I'll feel like it's necessary to clock out and leave. I just wanted to tell somebody.",Depression

48159,"Depression and memories of the past Is it normal to think only of negative things from the past or even see the past worse than it was while depressed?I keep going over a certain experience from the past the lasted for 2 years but it doesn't meet the criteria of PTSD but there was mistreatment from superiors and bullying from other colleagues but it wasn't consistent actually most of the time I was treated better except for some situations that I keep remembering till now.
3 weeks ago I switched to a different SSRI and I started having symptoms like anxiety panic ruminating over that experience and feeling worthless which I think were withdrawal symptoms from the old drug (lexapro) I noticed that these symptoms come when there is something wrong with the medication or I am going through a stressful time.I got a panic attack at work and my manager noticed and when I asked for some time off to recover they stalled and then they released an exit visa from the country and told me I would work remotely from my home country but there is no guarantee that they would keep their word. So now I am faced with the possibility of going back to my country which is going through a tough time economically and uncertainty about finding a new job. I am now back to the old drug I used to take and increased the dosage to 30mg with the Dr's supervision. I am not sure if the medication is not working yet or that I am going through a challenging time so I am having anxiety. I spend most of the time alone in my hotel room thinking of the past and worrying about the future and I am just exhausted. Your insight would be appreciated",Depression

I told her to worry about her children not mine.This morning at 6am I woke up to find my partner in his parents room talking. When he came back he stated ""It's me &amp; you"" over and over. Later he explained how no one will understand me or my Bipolar and how much weight I carry and how hard it can get for me on a daily basis. He didn't go into full details of the convo because I'm an overthinker but him stating his parents asking if I'm in therapy or taking medications made it obvious.

50741,"Seeing some progress but feeling stuck. Hi
24-year-old male with AVPD here. For some time I have noticed that contacts with other people (in my case only at work) began to bring me pleasure. I've also become more relaxed and when I'm around people I don't worry as much about how they react to what I say. At the same time a desire for more close relationhips arosed in me. This desire applies both to finding a partner and friends. I just want as real as never before in my life a simple conversation with another person and intimacy.However I don't know how to achieve this. I've finished my education and I don't have any social hobbies (the gym can be considered as such but I still can't find a way to start naturally a conversation with other people there). I'm starting to get annoyed with this situation because certainly something has changed in my attiude and I truly want to form some relationships outside of my work environment. I think I'm ready to get out of my comfort zone step by step but I don't know how to do it.One way to do it is to start dating. Finding a partner is something that I want very strongly and I think love is something I'm capable of. The thing that's holding me back from making that move though (other than well... the lack of photos to use on dating apps) is knowing that I'll be too much of a burden for her not having other relationships. Perhaps there is also an element of shame in not having any friends. I am not sure…Have any of you reached such a point on your journey to ""normality""? I'm not sure if I'm over-analyzing everything and if I shouldn't just do what I feel regardless of my doubts. In my case finding friends seems to be something more distant at the moment and I don't know how I could achieve it. However I will be grateful for every piece od advice!",Personality disorder
51075,"The hollow self My life is spent largely devoted to work. Between morning prep commute actual work hours and evening prep like laundry packing lunches and other small maintenance tasks I only get about 3 hours a day to be myself. After all I need to be in bed at a decent hour or else I won’t be well-rested for the next work day. That’s it. That’s my life.Meanwhile even though I’m so devoted to work that I sacrifice the vast majority of my life for it I’m barely earning enough money to survive. I have over $50000 in debt that is slowly growing as I struggle to make ends meet. I don’t know if I can ever pay it off. I can pay off maybe 1/3rd of it if I really push hard and eat ramen for the next 6 months. I’m turning 40 in 6 months.At what point am I supposed to go from “surviving” to “thriving”? I know most people earn the majority of their money later in life but I just don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. What is my purpose? Why am I grinding on the world’s worst-ever RPG system? I feel like I’m on an economic treadmill that keeps speeding up every year and at some point I know I won’t be able to keep up.My job itself is relatively easy I’m a data analyst at a medical device manufacturer. For the most part it’s just pulling reports for managers and being really good at Excel and Power BI. Though I don’t know if I’m that good at my job. Tomorrow marks 1 year in this position and every night I feel like I’m doing the bare minimum. Like I’m that guy on the team that everyone else talks about behind his back. I imagine they say things like “He’s so slow. What’s he even doing all day?” or “I better schedule this meeting because if I wait for him to do it it’ll never get done.” They don’t say these things out loud of course and maybe they don’t even think them… but maybe they do. Maybe I’m just treading water but refusing to swim towards the shore. I think I’m ok because my head is still above water but realistically if I keep doing this I will drown. I need to swim.I just feel like such a loser all the time. I don’t have kids and I don’t want them. I’m not married but I’ve been in a relationship with someone for just over 12 years. We live together. She makes a lot more than I do so she pays the mortgage and I pay everything else. It’s probably not a fair arrangement for her but I just literally don’t make enough to split everything 50/50. She earns $40k more than I do a year. She would literally need to pay our mortgage 3x a month just to get to my wage. Then we could split the 4th one that would make it even. Even with that justification in my mind it makes me feel like a loser. Not that she makes more than me- good for her! She deserves it! Just that I can’t contribute equally. I feel like a mooch. We work the same hours at the same company and do roughly the same amount of work. But her’s pays more. Them’s the breaks I guess.Overwhelming shame. About nearly everything.I’m too fat. I’m too bald. I’m too old.I’m not smart enough. I’m not rich enough. I’m not funny enough.I know those are called “automatic negative thoughts” or ANTs and like ants they should be easy to squash. I’ve read about them in cognitive behavioral therapy books. I would go to therapy but it’s expensive. My company pays for 3 sessions a year. The other 49 weeks you can fuck off and die I guess.Is there more to this life? Is this all I’m supposed to do? Click buttons all fucking day sit on the couch and scroll on my phone while watching some insipid movie or tv show then repeat? All day every day until I’m old enough to scrape by on social security? This is it huh? This is the whole fucking thing?There needs to be more because I swear sometimes it just doesn’t feel worth it. I’m not suicidal or anything but like what exactly is motivating me to keep going?I have hobbies and interests and I indulge in them as often as I can. I grow hot peppers and make my own hot sauces I hike in the woods and enjoy nature there’s so many things to occupy my free time—if I HAD ANY- but the fact is I devote 87.5% of my day to making someone else richer. So my measly 3 hours a day- which are in the darkness by the way because the sun has set- are not exactly prime times for gardening or hiking. I have an automatic timer that waters my plants for me because I can’t even be present to tend to my own garden.It’s absolutely ridiculous.When exactly am I supposed to do anything of substance of value?
3 hours in the fucking dark.That’s what I get to live off of.Most of that time is spent focusing on my increasing mound of debt.$50000 would literally change my life and put me back in the green for the first time in years. Meanwhile I get to help analyze the company private jet spend. Cost us over $365000 to operate for a total of 11 days last month. We paid $75000 just in pilot fees for the month of January. I don’t earn that in a year. So when I see how much money there is how much is available to toss around and just how little of it I get… why would I “work harder”? Why would I sign up for more of this disrespect?I just don’t know why. Why can’t I work 4 days instead of 5? Why can’t I be remote considering I have only had 1 face-to-face meeting in the last month? I’m wasting a ton of money on a car that I primarily use to get to work a ton of money on a special wardrobe that I only wear at work—it’s absurd. And depressing.",Personality disorder
51284,"am i forever going to be haunted by my ex-friend? **tw; rape sexual assault**i'm 23 and an ex-friend of mine is 24. three years ago i cut off our friendship. it was the closest relationship i've ever had and i've never felt more connected to a person since. i think about him everyday.
3 years ago my sister who we'll call S accused him of raping her. but she didn't even. i had to confront her about it.according to my ex-friend who we'll call F they got really really drunk one night and ended up having sex. one week or so after it happened F told me first. he said that S thought it was his imagination until he saw S had blocked him on every social media and he wasn't sure what happened. he thinks maybe she's guilty because S had a boyfriend at the time. he tells me to ask her what happened. i say ""maybe she thinks it was non-consensual since you were both inebriated?"" he says ""that's possible"" he tells me she was asleep he was in bed with her drinking and getting high (she had invited him into bed with her-she told me she felt he was a little brother and could trust him).he was drinking all night as she slept. when she woke up they were both black out drunk. he doesn't remember who kissed who first but that she ""initiated grinding"" and that something happened after that... it makes me sick thinking about it. after that night he tells me my mother messaged him saying ""never step foot into this house again. but OP needs you as a friend. so let's just promise to keep this between us."" he wasn't sure what that meant but was afraid of the worst.context matters. S was 30 years old. F was 20. she's a decently heavy drinker (by no means an alcoholic but she can hold her liquor). he's literally autistic. does it sound like an imbalance?maybe more context matters. the people who checked in on them noticed that he was decently lucid last time they were seen together while she was asleep high and drunk. passed out? blacked out? he claims he was in the process of getting drunk as she slept. even more context. my family has a shaky moral foundation. they lie to get money to get their way. they've made me do it even if i didn't want to. they don't care about anyone else except the family. but they'll even mess with family if it comes to it. my sister and mom planned to keep it from me. like i said my mom thought I needed F so much that she was willing to keep it a family secret.and i keep thinking... if F was a monster if F had such shaky grounds if F cared about power he would have played along with it.i know that monster's don't rape. people rape. but people also look out for themselves when they know they've fucked up. people are selfish. F didn't seem selfish to me. a self-aware rapist would have kept his mouth shut right?why didn't he accept my mother's conditions and kept the family secret? he told me my friendship with him was his greatest source of happiness. he would've done anything to preserve it. why didn't he? and my family knew this friend meant so much to me that they were willing to keep my sister's rape a secret for my sake? if F was a monster he would have taken the deal? but monster's don't rape. people do.F told me everything. he agreed that I should talk to S and get her side of the story. because he wasn't sure if he had raped her either. he didn't know. or was his game to play dumb?S told me that she only remembers flashes. ""he raped me"" she said after i asked. she starts crying. she says she woke up with bruised wrists. she woke up sore. she didn't look like she was lying. i don't think she was lying.and for three years i've been haunted by the idea. what if *truly* he didn't think he had raped her? not in the way idiot monstrous men believe that drunk women can consent. me and F took consent extremely seriously. but what if *truly* they were *both* extremely drunk and they lost control of their *both* their bodies and that nothing could have possibly made sense except for an ugly truth? if there *were* a reality where my friend was truly too drunk to rape someone and too drunk to give consent himself but somehow ended up having sex with someone equally too drunk to not give consent then what would that reality look like? because everyday i wake up and think that reality looks frighteningly close to this one.",Personality disorder

51741,"Seeing some progress but feeling stuck. Hi
24-year-old male with AVPD here. For some time I have noticed that contacts with other people (in my case only at work) began to bring me pleasure. I've also become more relaxed and when I'm around people I don't worry as much about how they react to what I say. At the same time a desire for more close relationhips arosed in me. This desire applies both to finding a partner and friends. I just want as real as never before in my life a simple conversation with another person and intimacy.However I don't know how to achieve this. I've finished my education and I don't have any social hobbies (the gym can be considered as such but I still can't find a way to start naturally a conversation with other people there). I'm starting to get annoyed with this situation because certainly something has changed in my attiude and I truly want to form some relationships outside of my work environment. I think I'm ready to get out of my comfort zone step by step but I don't know how to do it.One way to do it is to start dating. Finding a partner is something that I want very strongly and I think love is something I'm capable of. The thing that's holding me back from making that move though (other than well... the lack of photos to use on dating apps) is knowing that I'll be too much of a burden for her not having other relationships. Perhaps there is also an element of shame in not having any friends. I am not sure…Have any of you reached such a point on your journey to ""normality""? I'm not sure if I'm over-analyzing everything and if I shouldn't just do what I feel regardless of my doubts. In my case finding friends seems to be something more distant at the moment and I don't know how I could achieve it. However I will be grateful for every piece od advice!",Personality disorder

Legs felt weak had to sit down.I smoked it in at the bottom of my road so I sat down on a neighbour so outside wall (roughly 4ft high). Next thing I knew I woke up on the pavement looking up. I later found out from friends that were with me that I had fallen head first onto the concrete sidewalk from about 4 ft high. I am 99.999999% I had a concussion. Anyway next day all was fine - no anxiety. Obvious scars and bloody face but nothing else. About two weeks later I decide to play soccer with friends. The ball hit the back of head from behind.

Up to the surgery i was a mental wreck more than before. Now after the surgery ive been Well for the most part. I have had alot of fears after that actually got worse over the two years instead of better. Now to start This story up we gotta rewind a few months its a few days after Christmas im at granny inlaw having a good time when My girlfriend notice My right ankle is a little swollen above the achilles tendon we call the emergency eoc and he wants ud to Come in he frels it and want it scanned with ultrasound. It was fine. Now i didnt Think much of it then but im sure My ankle above the achilles always was swollen but i havent ever really looked much at My ancles.Now here is where it gets difficult two days later we Are home i wake up and notice i have a coin sized point bit left from My sternum with minor painand I get spells of dizziness.At night i get admitted to the ER and they do ultra sound ekg bloodwork work etc. And everythings fine except from slightly elevated troponin which could be scar tissue though they think i have a minor infection in my heart and release me sayinf i should be fine sfter some time but i dont feel fine. Onde home i get This feeling of not being able to get enough air when I breath. A week later im back in the ER they do the usual checks plus a ct and guess what im fine except for the same slightly elevated troponin and they release me Again sayings its just a minor infektion.
3 weeks later i have an appointment with a specialised cardiologist that is educated for valve disease and has byen following me for over a decade. She checks me and im fine My heart is in a good condition. Now i didnt feel happy when told so but extreme dissapointment i started to get a feeling of fear of Them having made a mistake or missed something . The reason being is that before My surgery the hospital i was in the ER at didnt see that My heart wasnt doing Well when I was in for chest pain(wasnt a heart attack but My valve failing badly) the Same pain i have Now. Now i startede going to a psych every third week and its good. But at this point im uncertain of what is wrong ive been checked at the hospital 3times and at a specialized cardiologist and they havent found much that could explain the pain.So im trying to accept the fact it could be anxiety driven but the moment i started trying it i got issues with breathing Again.

52548,"How I am *almost* over my Health Anxiety Quick intro:
3 years a go I had an incident in the shower that mimicked a stroke. I came out of it unharmed but it messed me up psychologically. Ever since then my body takes any feeling it gets and goes into panic mode. Now i hate driving i hate taking a shower i hate exercising. You name it if i makes me hot i get anxious. At onc point i was so anxious showering i had to sit down and hold on for dear life the entire time i was in there.Now i'm about 80% over it. and form my experience the only way over it - is to go through it. And what i mean by that is you need to face this demon head on. I know its the last thing you want to hear but trust me. If you never face it you will be running forever.However it will take time for your brain to rewrite its default path ways. So at the moment the default behavior is fear and to curl up and say please dont hurt me. So your brain interprets it as a threat and will spiral out of control causing all sorts of symptoms the worst of which being a panic attack.Now next time you start getting the fear coming on try this instead. Say to your fear out loud ""Just kill me then"" ""Bring it on"" ""Lets see what you can do"" and taunt your fear and let what ever you think is going to happen happen. by wanting the what ever it is you are afraid of to happen will make the fear vanish.Another thing to think. If you were to say have a heart attack it would just happen... whether you worried or not. Worrying isnt going to some how miraculously save you.At my lowest - the turning point for me was when i just thought i'd rather be dead than to feel like this anymore. and from then on i basically laid down my life to my fear and said just kill me. Kill me now or shut the fuck up. I needed to hit rock bottom so I could rebuild my brain the right way. and for a few weeks i just kept saying ""Kill me now or shut up"" over and over until my brain started using the new default behavior. It can take months to retrain your brain and then add years on that to fully forget. but this is what is working for me.TLDR: Taunt your fear. egg it on. call it out. ask it to do its worst even if it kills you. Let it flow through you and out the other side I bet nothing bad happensTLDR 2: If you were going to die it would just happen... whether you worried or not. Worry isnt going to some how miraculously save you",Anxiety

52727,"Having anxiety and PTSD over being excluded from a reunion. Toxic ex-friend who socially traumatized me was invited. **TL;DR: Having very mixed feelings over a reunion that I was not invited to but I feel I should have been plus a former friend who socially traumatized me was invited**Backstory: I am a pro player at a certain game. I went viral on YouTube and Reddit (different profile). The game's official YouTube channel's video of my gameplay has over 5M views and is the third most-viewed video on the channel. I had worked with the game's PR on stuff in the past and was always welcome at events and such.I befriended many other players of this game over social media. I deactivated Facebook in early 2021 because I realized my mental health issues were showing and people were leaving group chats because of me and even unfriending me. I decided to deactivate before I ruined any friendships that meant a lot to me. I still maintain strong friendships with many of my fellow players.For many years the makers of the game said that they would never do a tournament or any kind of ""bring together the best players"" event because the player base is just too large and because the game is very luck-based (but if you're like me you can sort of manipulate your odds). This year a new person was put in charge of the game and they have decided to finally have a special event reuniting ""fan favorite"" players in person most of whom went viral in the same way I did.
15 people were invited and I was not one of them. The day the invitations went out I got several messages from fellow players asking me ""Did you get invited to the thing?"". Many in the community were shocked I was not and one of them said ""They're missing out without you"". When I found out this was happening I started trembling with anxiety for multiple reasons. One being that I was overthinking why I wasn't invited and paranoia that I may be blacklisted (I have been very vocal about the game's flaws on social media). One thing that got me was that around the time my gameplay was posted I was often grouped with two other great players in promotional stuff and we were kind of like the de-facto ""GOAT trio""; we were the top three viewed videos on the YouTube channel at the time though a couple have snuck between us since then. These two people were both invited to the reunion event. I am so happy for those who were invited and I'm trying to convince myself that not everyone could get this opportunity but I can't help but feel hurt and worried.The ""reunion"" happened today and I purposefully avoided everyone's social media so I wouldn't have to see photos or anything of them hanging out at bars or restaurants and stuff afterwards. I suffer from FOMO big time. I've flown out to events that friends went to just to avoid FOMO but I didn't have time to fly out for this reunion even to just stop by and say hi. The event is not being publicized until May so I'm going to have to deal with this feeling again in a couple of months.Part of the reason I am anxious about this whole thing is because one of the players who was invited to the reunion is a former close friend of mine. We bonded over the game of course and his high score blew mine out of the water. We discovered we had a lot in common. He also suffers anxiety and he gave me advice on what meds are better than others; I still take the one he recommended me to this day. We're also both gay and I found him very attractive (as did many others in our community). Our friendship shattered when I went to visit him in person (across the country) and he showed very manipulative behavior that I was too naive to discern at the time. He purposefully distanced himself from me whenever we were in a room together (e.g. sitting on a different couch) and excluded me from ""parties"" he went to while I was in town to prevent anything sexual happening between us and lying about them. He had been sending me several pictures of him shirtless and in bed with other guys we knew knowing it would turn me on among many other forms of leading me on but never had the courage to say ""I don't like you like that"". Instead he let me come all this way and then gaslit me for trying to come on to him saying it was inappropriate behavior (behavior that he exhibited with other guys right in front of me and said ""It's different with them"" when I asked). We tried to move on from that experience while staying friends but then he kept making jokes about me with the other guys and I got tired of it. We haven't spoken in months and when we did speak it was only because he had a question about the game.I suffered so much social trauma from this person I trusted and his group of friends who seemed like a Mean Girls Plastics clique that acted polite around me but I later realized they didn't care about me one way or the other. I followed all of them on Instagram and only one followed me back. These people ostracized and humiliated me on top of my friend's various forms of mental and emotional abuse. The trauma only started setting in as months passed and I started crying myself to sleep and sort of ""reenacting"" the day everything happened in my head wishing I was more assertive. Now I get PTSD at the mention of his name and I deleted almost every picture I took on my trip to meet him. So since he was invited to the reunion I might have declined if I was invited so I wouldn't have to be in the same room as him because it would have been so triggering for me and I would not have been able to concentrate on the game. That being said I would definitely be willing to take a day to have a serious discussion with this person over how he made me feel and maybe we could start over strictly as friends because I do think he is a good person.I really hope come May when the reunion is made public that I don't suffer any more PTSD. I hope I can find some healthy distractions.Has anyone ever been in a situation like this involving being excluded from an outing involving a traumatic person from your past?",Anxiety
