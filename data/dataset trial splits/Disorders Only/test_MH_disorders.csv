34601,Stinging pain in far left side of chest thats worse when I move my left arm. Hey guys.Im trying to get some help identifying what this may be. For about a week Ive had a constant pain in the far left side of my chest.I went to the doctor about it who said my blood pressure and heart sounded fine so I should just carry on as normal. However having HA Im freaking out that its not fine. I have noticed that if I raise and lower my left arm the pain comes on sharper as a burning stinging like sensation in the same far left spot on my chest.Any idea what this may be and if I need a second opinion? ,Anxiety

51790,Does anybody else has worse anxiety alone than around other people? Like when I'm hanging out with the others they are distracting me from my anxiety. When I'm alone I just can't focus I know it's coming and can't stop it.Today I wanted to work on my computer project.

35025,ThroatChest Palpatations Left Eye twitch and weakness almost everywhere So I had been doing great with my health anxiety for nearly a year. I actually havent visited this sub reddit in a few months as things were smooth sailing. It all started last Sunday and its only gotten worse. Ive been having this palpitation that happens probably 34 times ever single hour along with my eye twitching constantlypain in back of my head. It feels like I constantly have to burpthrow up. Anytime I eat I feel sick and either want to puke or use the bathroom. Accompanied with these symptoms is general weaknessfatigue everywhere. The pressurepain in my cheststomach refuses to go away. No amount of pepto or antacids works.Ive posted on this subreddit before that I am terrified of having a heart condition. Ive had a lot of testing done after one incident back in 2015 and doctors have said Im fine. I dont know what any of this could be. Maybe its something they didnt find with my heart? Maybe its something else? But its been a weak and its just been so damn frustrating. Any thoughts opinions and responses are more than welcome.,Anxiety
34300,Health anxiety makes everyday tasks so difficult Some background about my health anxiety history Ive had severe health anxiety intermittently since my teens. Most often I am preoccupied with my heart. My heart rate has always jumped up quickly 180ish bpm with minimal exercise or even at times of rest but my resting heart rate is usually 4555 bpm. I mention numbers just because my heart rate is a little atypicalbut I have been checked out by cardiologists so many times over the past 15 years always with the reassurance that I am fine. Most recently this past summer I wore a 30 day holter monitor where they would measure my episodes of high heart rate. They also did a stress test numerous ekgs etc. They confirmed I had periods of sinus tachycardia but it was normal rhythm and said I was healthy. They said the heart was appropriately responding and was likely beating fast because of anxiety which I dont think is the whole story I think I have a food allergy which can trigger it but thats beside the point.. They gave me a low dose of beta blockers to take as needed for comfortanxiety but promised I wouldnt have a heart attack with or without the pills. Anyways to bring my story to today Ive been putting off doing laundry for far too long. Im embarrassed to admit I have been buying new clothes to prolong my laundry chore. The issue is in my apartment I have to carry my laundry down a few flights of stairs outside and into another building. After its clean I have to carry it again outside and then up a few flights of stairs. The laundry basket is heavy and my heart races so fast when I do this and I panic. I just did a load and I could feel my heart beating out of my chest. I sat down with a glass of water and within 60 seconds my heart rate was back in the 70s. I remind myself that my stress test was normal even when they brought my heart rate to 190 for several minutes. But I am still so freaked out. I have several more loads to do and Im so afraid.I know part of the answer is that I am incredibly out of shape and weak. This is not coincidence I am extremely avoidant of anything that raises my heart rate and am terrified of exercising. I stopped wearing my Fitbit a few months ago at the urging of my therapist because I obsessively measured my heart rate and was even afraid of standing upwalking I believed if my heart rate went above 80 it would trigger a heart attack. Taking off my Fitbit was one of the scariest things Ive done but now that its been a few months I feel SO much better. I do my best not to measure heart rate now and have been going on more walks but lifting anything makes me feel my heart rate and I cant ignore it. I just feel so stuck and like I cant keep up with basic chores. I feel like a failure of an adult. I dont know what Im asking for this is mostly a rant. Ive been lurking this subreddit for months and its brought me a lot of comfort. Health anxiety is such a difficult illness but this community helps me feel less alone.TLDR my health anxiety is about my heart rateheart attacks. Basic chores like laundry elevate my heart rate and cause panic and avoidance. Feel like I cant keep up with life. ,Anxiety
34148,Never ending coldflu I'm sooo tired of being sick!Since december my health dropped. I had a really stressful semester and when it was done I got sick. Like a cold. Then it was fine for like a week and then another cold that felt more like a flu but not quite it. A big big cold. And a week later today I have the flu I think. I'm coughing like crazy my lungs hurt and now fever. Crazy headache.It's just like my body hates me! I don't know what to do except venting. It's really not nice I feel like a pile of poo right now.

34941,Love yourselfTake care of yourself. Historically for me.. JanuaryMarch is the hardest time for year for me.My Anxiety journey began two years ago in February. One of my best friends passed from a Brain Tumor the month before. I went to his funeral and they talked about all the symptoms he had.... next thing I know Im consumed by constantly looking for the same symptoms. Then they start to appear.... One day Im fine. The next day I have a pain in my neck and googled it and was convinced it was cancer and I was going to die and leave my young wife and daughter. Then I had a full blown panic attack on Valentines Day and ended up in the ER convinced I was having a heart attack.Since then it has been on and off struggles with a brain tumor fearmy longest battle. But every January the anxiety comes back with a vengeance. I know this is the case for a lot of people... the bad weather the dark days with not a lot to do it takes a toll. Remember. Take care of yourself. Excercise hell even just go on a walk. Distract yourself. Dont seclude yourself. Dont google. Eat your greens. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. Were all fighting the same battle. Were all constantly battling with the very real symptoms that our bodies have. The very real fear of passing before your time or having a terminal disease. I care about each and every one of you. Hang in there. And lets fight the good fight every day. ,Anxiety
34454,Hantavirus Hi all. I have OCD hypochondria panic disorder Cyclothymia blah blah blah the whole nine yards. Health anxiety fucks me up like daily but this week it's been super bad. So my fiance and I found a mouse in our room and kept it in a box for a bit because we had just had a bad snowstorm and don't want to put it out there and have it freeze. We've been packing because we're about to move and so we've been kicking stuff up but haven't found any droppings. Of course after we caught the mouse there were droppings in the box. Anyway now about a week and a half later I have heavy chest pressure a dry cough and back pain in the area of pleurisy. I went to medemerge last night and my blood pressure was 9865 pretty low but the doctor kept saying how great it was. I was diagnosed with a upper respiratory infection but she also gave me an antibiotic because my tonsils were pretty big. Well this morning I wake up and as I'm brushing my teeth I hack up something black. What the hell?!? I'm freaking out! I live in NJ but don't know the Hantavirus facts about NJ.,Anxiety

Think back to the time you experienced or started experiencing your first anxiety induced panic attacks the shock and debilitation from not knowing or understanding what is going on with you and the lack of control you feel over your own body in trying to identify it to make it better If you could go back in time to that first experience and sit down beside that person knowing what you know now about your relationship with anxiety what would you say? ,Anxiety

35143,Anyone have constant vivid dreams with health anxiety? Hello allampx200BI don't even know where to begin. These last few months have been absolutely unforgiving to me. I had three family members pass way in three months. I wish I was making this up. One died in October November and early January. Also in November I was diagnosed with early stage melanoma. Now I already suffer with severe health anxiety however these events have really set me off. I focus on every aspect of my body from my breathing coughs to my abdominal paints to my moles. I have some symptoms that I hope are associated with health anxiety.I have been focusing more on my breathing. Not that I have been having trouble breathing I sleep well but I focus on it more now which makes me think I'm putting in more effort. Also since October I've been having very vivid dreams almost every night never ending ones. And I never wake up feeling like they're good dreams. I feel like all of my fears manifest in these dreams. I have had a vivid dream almost every night for months and I don't know how to get rid of them. I try praying right before I sleep but that doesn't help all the time.I need help ,Anxiety

35067,Fear of Brain Aneurysm presenting as Headaches and Pulsatile Tinnitus So for the last five years or so i 26m have had some various symptoms that i am not sure are simply me being aware of them or something much greater. In particular I experience Pulsatile Tinnitus where i can clearly hear my heartbeat thumping in my left ear much greater than my right. Exertion makes it much more noticeable. Occasionally I also experience mild to moderate headaches that seem to follow a distinct line from the back of my skull to right behind my left eye. Some mornings if i sleep on my left side I will wake up with a headache on the left side of my head that throbs in time with my heart and laughingsneezingstraining can create a very weird sensation in that same area behind my left eye. I don't know if i could describe it but to my HAaddled brain it seems like what you'd feel if you had a ballooned vein suddenly swell slightly.I also have been experiencing a slight visual disturbance in the left eye where lights and bright objects have a small shimmery 'smear' above or below them hardly noticeable unless I'm looking for it but still strange. I know symptomatic unruptured aneurysms can cause double vision but this seems to minor that I couldn't trust whether or not this is what 'double vision' entails. I have 2020 vision don't smoke drink or do drugs no family history of aneurysms to my knowledge my grandmother did die of a stroke she was 86 though. I did have a MRI done when i first encountered these symptoms about 5 years ago and they found nothing the visual disturbance was there during that time but I'm unaware if the pulsatile tinnitus was.I've had a long bloody history with Health Anxiety and I'm reaching out to you guys to finally admit that i've got a worrying problem. Can anyone shed light on if my fears are justified?,Anxiety
34455,Back pain and worst anxiety day in years!! Crying and scared 33 female. I have been doing really well with health anxiety not googling going to therapy etc. NOT TODAY! i am terrified I have some sort of kidney disease or something. Last night when I went to bed at 1 am i was irritated with back pain sort of mid back no matter how i moved so I changed my pillow my old one was giving me neck pain and headaches and still no relief. I didn't sleep well. I have been unable to function all morning so far bc I can't stop googling kidney failure infections back pain etc. I have sort of all over back pain mid back lower back not sharp but achey and like i pulled something. I can really feel it when i take a deep breath or move. Sitting on my couch right now even hurts. I finally broke down and took ibuprofen. I also keep excessively checking my urine to see if its cloudy and keep moving and touching my back and checking for other kidney symptoms. On sunday i spend several hours sitting on the floor going through several closets of clothing reaching and moving differently than normal. Yesterday I carried a heavy gaming system by myself from the floor to my car to the post office I also used my lap top while sitting on my couch to work most of the day and evening....Is it possible this is from weird posture and will go away or should I be going to the ER???? I know my anxiety is probably making it worse and my husband and parents are giving me the silent treatment now because I've had a slip in my anxiety. I am just really really really scared.,Anxiety
34607,Hydroxyzine for Anxiety After having anxiety for most of my life I had my first panic attack last night. I went to the ER today to make sure everything was working okay I was experiencing chest pains and I told my doctor about my anxiety. I've never gotten treated for it because it hasn't been totally unmanageable until lately. I am a 22 year old college student so most of my current anxietyworriment comes from the stress of school. The doctor prescribed me Hydroxyzine 25 mg. Since this is my first time taking anything for anxiety I was wondering if anybody has taken this for anxiety? If you have has it helped? Any experiences with hydroxyzine will be helpful. Thank you so much in advance.,Anxiety

I have had like a nagging pain there that comes and goes randomly most of the week and dont know why. Of course the first thought is heart related because 20 year olds have so many heart attacks. The logical part of my brain tells me its indigestion or Im just backed up or something. But the terrible part of the brain says a heart attack is imminent. Just wondering if anyone has had similar experience and or have any tricks to prove to themselves that whatever it is your feeling is not a heart attack but more likely nothing serious at all. ,Anxiety

33987,Im 19 yo and my hair is thinning and more worrying symptoms I first noticed my hair thinning two months ago. I've always had thick hair that would grow pretty quickly. Now my hair's gotten thin and quite dry. The thinning is more extreme on the sides of my head with visible patches at the top there arent any such patches but still thinning and dryness. I impulsebought biotin tablets to help with the thinning but im hesistant to take them at the moment since nothing's been diagosed yet.But it's not just the hair. I have also been getting although not frequent a tingling sensation in my right fingers and sometimes on a whole hand at times. More recently say the last week or so my vision's gotten blurry. I don't know if the blurred vision is permanent and i've just gotten use to it or not but ive definitely had these phases. Ive looked up my 'symptoms' and what's come up are thyroid conditions B12 deficiencies and a whole load more. With B12 deficiency in particular its symptoms seem to align with mine pretty closely. Other than my symptoms ive mentioned already B12 deficiency symptoms include 'tiredness' and 'memory loss' i feel like i have these or atleast they're more pronounced recently ive always been fairly forgetful.Im genuinely worried if i have some serious conditon. Ive booked an appointment with my doctor and hopefully i can get however many of these symptoms i actually have sorted. Sorry for this being so long winded. Stay healthy friends.,Anxiety
34115,paranoid about testicles and now I'm freaking out So I'm totally serious here and I know it sounds like I'm trying to be funny but I'm not! A week ago I was lazy and didn't do laundry so I went commando for pretty much a week. Because of how loose it was down there I became more aware of my testicles and would reach down there more often. Anyways because I was constantly reaching down there I became paranoid about my testicles. I should also note that I was a frequent fapper like 34 times a day and decided to stop that. So I would go nofap for 2 days and then have a go at it once the next day. Then again 2 days not and then on the 3rd day have a go at it. I started this 2 weeks ago and last week I felt a little pinch on my left testicle. It didn't hurt or anything it was just... uncomfortable but went away fairly quickly but that feeling only heightened my paranoia!!I haven't felt that feeling since but I keep thinking about it and now I keep imagining I do have that feeling again. I always constantly reach down there feeling them and thinking omg one is bigger than the other! omg one feels softer than the other! I'm dying!I want to go to the doctor but I also have a fear of doctors! I can't sleep. I'm undereating. I sometimes cry at night. I was never like this and I hate it. Last year I was paranoid about my neck which took me a while to get over and now it's below the belt. I just want to live my life normally again. ,Anxiety

It comes and goes. I went to the doctor last friday he did a neurological exam and nothing came out of it that is unusual. He gave me some anti inflammatory medicine.

33934,I cant wait for this health anxiety phase to be over with. Als or carpal tunnel? Female age 26Duration of complaint 3 weeks. Area on body hands arms sometimes feet and thighs. I went to the doctor a week ago who diagnosed me with carpal tunnel. And gave me a brace that helped a little. Hand pain coincided with symptoms of carpal tunnel but it still made me nervous because my grandmother died of als and nerve pain always puts me on edge. I dont show any other signs of als besides very little muscle twitching. I am doing some weird things to test myself through out the day. For example. Testing my WPM words per minute that I can type. Which is 75 words per minute . I do this to see if I have any weakness in my hands I am standing on one foot to see if I can balance myself and shit like that. Also tonight I just came home from dinner and I was holding a fork and I noticed it felt very odd in my hands. It was a heavier than normal fork because it was at a steak house. I also have health anxiety but I wish I knew I was okay. So I can stop worrying. I feel some pins and needles in my hands and light shooting pain in my arms and feet and thighs. Any help would be appreciated . Thank you. ,Anxiety
34576,I need new ways to cope Im 26 year old female and Ive been struggling with health anxiety since I was 17.Whenever Im sick or hungover my heart starts racing and I have a hard time calming down or sleeping. Ive been to the doctor about my heart and everything always checks out as normal but I cant keep the anxiety and worried thoughts away. The best form of coping that Ive used is showering. On a bad day Ill shower around 56 times a day. It seems to be the only place I can meditate and really relax and get my HR down. Im lucky to have at least that but its not very practical especially when Im trying to function with my day to day responsibilities school work socializing. I need something else to get my heart to calm down. Breathing exercises or meditating outside of the shower never works for me because I cant calm down enough to focus.Ive never posted on here before but this sub is regularly helpful to me and any responses are appreciated.

34733,My story of chronic chest pain and health anxiety Six weeks ago I M26 was keeled over in bed clutching my chest. I felt a pain on my left side that felt deep and biting. It subsided shortly but since then I had what felt like a mass in my chest. Im not newcomer to chest pain either. Last year I was diagnosed with having PVCs preventricular contractions which are benign but ended up requiring me to get a Halter monitor and Echo. Those results indicated my heart was fine. Now however I was panicked thinking I might have a respiratory problem. I started googling lung cancer symptoms bone cancer symptoms the whole nine yards. One night I had a full blown panic attack thinking I was going to die from what felt like a huge tumor growing in my chest. And that damn pain never went away I paid attention to the tightness I felt in my chest all the time it was inescapable. While at times I would be distracted and not notice it a large portion of my day is spent studying and during those times of quite my mind would be drawn to the tightness I was feeling. I should also mention Im in medical school so learning all of the pathologies that could happen to a person made anything I felt be drawn to the worst diseases Ive since come to learn. It was only last week that I actually discovered this subreddit and I became sure my chest pain was related to anxiety. The anxiety of school the anxiety of my chest pain and the anxiety I had regarding my own mortality after a recent friend passed away. And what made it worse was that all of these things were acting as a positive feedback loop. For example Id stress about an exam which would provoke my chest pain which would make me more anxious which lead to worse chest pain and on and on. Maddening. Even though I knew how incredible rare it would be for a young nonsmoker to be diagnosed with a disease like lung cancer it was always where my mind went. In order to rule out actually having a physiological problem I got an Xray done today and it came back negative for anything. Though I question if that was the right thing to do. I dont want to be a hypochondriac and get needless and expensive tests done. And in some ways I felt like I gave in to my emotions. However Id be lying if I said I wasnt much more relaxed knowing that my problem stems from anxiety and not pathology. I write this only to say that chest pain is scary but more often not a lifethreatening ordeal. I hope to calm those who come here freaking out about a symptom similar to mine. And while I still have the pain I now understand it and accept it. Our bodies are weird and no one has the same body as you or will experience the same symptoms as you. My body likes to give me chest pains which are sometimes chronic sometimes short sometimes after a tough exercise. But after having run the gamut of tests Im actually just fine. TLDR Chest pain turned out to be nothing but anxiety after extensive testing. Youre fine. ,Anxiety

34842,I've never had an ulcer and can't remember the last time I had acid reflux. Upper stomach pain... brain says cancer logic says acid reflux or ulcer. Help? Mostly asking what an ulcer really feels like. I've never had one before as far as I know I'm 29 and have never been diagnosed with one. But then again because of insurance issues I've not really been able to see a doctor in like. Years. It's ridiculous. Long story. Anyway I'm hoping to get insurance and be able to at least be seen within the next few months. Until then though reassurance is kind of all I can get.I know what that sharp burning acid reflux feels like I used to get it sometimes in high school but generally I don't ever experience that. I honestly can't remember the last time I got that sickly burning acid reflux feeling. My diet's really bland out of preference mostly vegetarian some but not a lot of meat which I think contributes to a lot of my inexperience with acid reflux.I have pain in my upper abdomen right in the middle. I can't tell if I'm feeling it in my esophagus liver or upper stomach. It feels very close to the surface and hurts when I push on it. It doesn't really feel like the way acid does when it trickles up into the esophagus. The pain worsens when I have gas and eases up when that passes. It's dull and honestly easy enough to just work through but the fact that I've been having it almost every day for a couple of weeks now concerns me.Doesn't hurt to breathe. Just this dull ache ranging from annoying to actually kind of ouch but still not enough to vocalise about. Just concerning because it keeps happening.I used to drink a couple beers every night but now have since eliminated that to see if it makes a difference I can't tell if it helps. Feels the same as when I drank every night. Is it possible that this is just acid reflux and that it can feel different from the hot burning feeling in the heart area?Does this sound more like an ulcer?For what it's worth I think I'm in fairly good healthjust underweight 95lbs 5'4 Female with no family history of cancer but I recently learned I have a family history of gall bladder problems. Mildly sedentary activity levels work a desk job and tend to spend a lot of time writing at my computer while at home.Any advice to tide me over until insurance comes through would rock.

35752,Severe health anxiety... lost 15 lbs. need support. I started having abdominal pain that radiates to the back in January did a bunch of blood test ultrasound and xRay. I was diagnosed with Fatty Liver which is not related to my pain. I was told to loose weight and that I should be good.I was on a diet for a month after the fatty liver diagnose lost 4KG in a month which scared the hell out of me but I keep telling myself its because Im on a diet. But Im also noticing that my appetite isnt very good I have bad days and good days. I just feel nauseous on bad days like I literally dont wanna eat anything. My pain has almost gone away now.Now Im obsessing over cancer like lymphoma and things like that checking my lymph nodes and literally I feel pain in my groin area.Ive always had health anxiety all my life but last 3 months I feel really depressed over my health anxiety constant worrying.Any suggestions? Planning on going back to my doctor? Im not eating as much these days due to nausea. I dont even know how to explain to my doctor anymore. This weight loss is concerning is though on good days I control my diet due to fatty liver...,Anxiety

34630,Terrified of colon cancer Hi everyoneI'm in full blown panic attack right now and I can't function properly because of it. I've practically convinced myself I have colon cancer. My symptoms are blood while defacating especially while constipated but when I'm not I sometimes feel my anus hurt and see the blood on the paper then diarrhea constipation pain on the right side of abdomen for over a year now it comes and goes now it's mostly in my upper back extreme fatigue I've had black stool once but it was after drinking red wine so I thought then that's the causeI'm also scared the cancer is already in my bonesspine as my back often hurts and I can feel some kind of dent in my spine. I'm also diagnosed with severe anxiety duh so sometimes it's hard to tell which symptoms are real For example my fiancee tells this dent in my spine it's just my muscles contracting because of my anxiety. The same can be said about diarrhea fatigue... But then again how do I know when it's anxiety and when it's real?I know I should just wait for the colonoscopy in 4 weeks but I can't function properly right now. I've made mistake and visited a forum for colon cancer survivors and not only they all have symptoms similar to mine but lot of them were very young like me. My doctor told me it's probably IBS and hemorrhoids but my mom had colon cancer at 50 and I've read it's getting more and more common in young people and here I am crying myself to sleep every night because I'm convinced I'm dying. What should I do?,Anxiety

Since then I've been looking for triggers that makes me feel more anxious. Like a pattern. So I could deal better with it I dont have any pro help. I've realized that my anxiety gets worse when I have to talk with people. So I've been trying to better my communication. And Im better actually. I'm feeling more calm around other people. But there is something that it's haunting me since I'm trying to better my anxiety. I realized that there are some people that makes me worse. Sometimes even colleagues. For some reason when I see them or talk with I have a bad feeling a heavy energy and my anxiety explodes. Because of that I cant trust on them. And I'm always in the alert mode when I'm around them. I don't know if this is a problem that my anxiety creates in my mind or if it's something that other people also feels.That's why i'm here.

Its gotten so bad that I barely leave the house and Im afraid to exert myself which is depressing because I used to be a gym rat and exercising was what I used to do help cope with my anxiety but thats not something I can do anymore Atleast In my mind I cant. This has really intensified over this past year after dealing with multiple panic attacks that have landed me in the ER and Ive been getting a bunch of physical symptoms constantly that does not help with my worrying. Ive had many tests done and the doctors are very reassured that Im healthy. My Doc believes the Lexapro will help me but I cant seem to find the courage to take it.

35648,Seeking postcancer anxiety advice I had cancer at 21 and been clear since but it created some serious anxiety. I get real aches and pains from the scars but also the fake aches and pains from anxiety the trouble is differentiating between them. I usually get weird looks when I see a doctor about these aches and pains so I feel embarrassed to see my general doctor. I have trouble keeping up with my cancer tests and follow ups because Ive always been needlephobic and get panic attacks when it comes to anything related to medical emergencies. I know better then to search WebMD but if I hadnt searched WebMD when I was 21 I wouldnt have suspected a tumor and seen a doctor so I have a fear that cancer is back or that theres a real unrelated issue. Im trying to see a psychiatrist but does anyone have advice on how to deal with the health anxiety so it doesnt get to the point where I feel the need to go to an ER? Is there any benefit to seeing a cardiologist or checking on these anxiety aches and pains? Is there such a thing as health related PTSD?,Anxiety
35720,Okay I can't live like this. How do I get help? I've had health anxiety since I can remember I was like probably 6 or 7 when I had my first flare up but this last year it is off the charts. I actually have had some health scares and I think it's triggering it beyond belief. I think it's actually causing the aches and pains. I'm at the point where I'm 500 sure I have colon cancer and ALS and cervixovarian cancer and an undiagnosed heart issue. Now my kidneys hurt? So naturally my cancer has spread. It's been like this for a year and my only relief has been when seasonal depression hits.I'm getting married soon. I have a good job. I have lots to look forward to but I'm so so sure I won't be around to see it. I need help and no one takes me seriously. My doctor doesn't understand that this iya ruining my life and keeps giving me meds. With side effects. To someone with health anxiety. I've taken like six different types and none help at all. I can only afford 4 sessions of therapy per year and have found them mostly useless.There has to be something. I can do. I'm so sure I'm going to die and I'm fucking terrified.,Anxiety

34337,The fear just keeps getting worse and I need some advice Hi allI've had health anxiety ever since I was a little kidbut this past month I have been unable to manage it anymore.I know that what I feel and fear is irrational and improbable but I can't seem to make myself truly believe this.Instead I just keep googling and freak myself out constantly.The past month I've been very paranoid about pregnancywhich is irrational in itself my last sexual contact was in october and the circumstances made pregnancy very unlikelyafter PCOS treatment completely fucked up my cycles.Two weeks ago I had an ultrasound to ease my mind and everything came back negative which relaxed me for a while.But now I can't stop worrying about an ectopic pregnancy that could rupture at any moment and kill me.The doctor only checked my uterus and ovariesand because of this I worry that she could have missed it if it was ectopic.I've been having a lot of cramps and spasms pain that goes from my neck to my shoulder and a couple weeks ago I had an episode of really bad sharp abdominal pain that I attributed to bad nutrition and stress.I know this probably sounds crazy but I can't shake the thought that there's a ticking time bomb inside of me.I'm really panicked and I just want to move on.How do I deal with this?,Anxiety

Get nervous around attractive people for some reason. Yea. ... It is interesting... but these don't normal trigger. I am fine in crowds or social situations.

51586,I live with two people in my family who have schizophrenia and there was a butcher knife placed on a picture of me im a 19 year old cc student and i live with my grandma mom uncle aunt and little sister.my mom has a meth addiction and shes developed schizophrenia from it and its been getting worse as the years go on. my uncle was hit on the head at a young age and im not exactly sure what he struggles since we never talk but i think its schizophrenia. my mom doesnt take her meds i think and my grandma is constantly trying to help her with moving in and out of motels and rehabs and all this stuff for the past 8 months or so realistically shes been trying to help her for many many years now but my mom had moved out recently my mom moved back in like a week ago. my uncle is very strange and i dont know really anything about him. he leaves his room a few times a day and doesnt talk to anyone sometimes i hear him talk to himself in his room but he doesnt yell and scream like my mom does hes just very quiet and intense. so earlier tonight i was using my grandmas phone for school since mine was dead and i got curious to look in her messages between my mom because ive seen messages between them before where my mom is talking about how she hears voices talking about someone wanting to kill me and how shes constantly was thinking about me and she doesnt think im safe. so i looked and my aunt shes mentally well sent my grandma a picture where she found a big butcher knife placed on top of a picture of me. the message said uncles name is acting strange again. i asked moms name if she did this and she said she didnt. does uncles name know what it means to stab someone? that they will die? in the photo my aunt sent my grandma the picture of me was in like a mouse pad that was custom made with a photo of me from 4th grade. the thing is im not sure if its a coincidence because the mouse pad is on a desk for like where a computer used to be but the desk in like directly connected to the kitchen like almost next to it so it could be possible that someone had happened to place that knife there so i didnt really freak out. but i talked to some friends and when i kinda said it out loud to them i did kinda realize like damn that does kinda sound bad and they told me that yea its probably not safe. i dont know if it was my uncle or mom either though if it even was intentional. my uncle used to come home and hit me in the head as a kid a lot and we would yell and scream at each other we lived together for like 6 years and this would happen then we moved then we moved again and he moved back in with us but ever since we moved back in again we literally do not talk to each other at all. hes very awkward around me and everyone tbh and quiet and i can tell he doesnt like to be in the same room as me even though i do not interact with him at all whatsoever. weve said hey to each other like less than 10 times over the years and thats about it. he does kinda seem like he hates me but i dont think he would want to kill me. on the other hand its possible that my mom was lying to my aunt but from what ive seen i dont think my mom wants to kill me either. whenever she has talked about me in that way its more of a this is my son i need to protect him from whoever gonna kill him type of way rather than a malicious tone. but again they are both schizophrenic which i really dont know much about besides they can be unpredictable and so thats why im asking. i know its weird to ask about this on reddit but i really dont have anyone to talk to about it. im not going to directly confront my uncle about it because again we are very distant and hes a big guy i just dont want to i feel like itd be worse and i dont want to ask my mom because i know she would say no even if she did. im going to ask my grandma tomorrow since i havent been able to since shes been asleep all night but shes just going to ignore me after i express my concerns which she always does. i can talk to my aunt about it even though were not really too close but yeah. another thing is my grandma sent the photo my aunt sent her to my uncle asking if he did it and he kind of just ignored it didnt deny it so. but yea i cant really move out or anything i dont have the money for that since i just graduated high school and honestly i dont have a job right now since im a full time student and i just dont know where i would go. i dont have any friends that would let me live with them either so thats out of the picture . the best thing im hoping for is the convince my grandma to have them move out but thatll probably never happen even though i want it to so bad. i just dont know if this is a coincidence with the knife and i shouldnt be worried or what i should do so yea pls help,Anxiety

52197,I really need some help with managing my anxiety when it comes to lack of cleanliness Hey everyone. I'm new here. I'm writing this to be very transparent and to ask for help. I don't want to ruin my relationship or participate in toxic communication habits. I am finding that my anxiety really acts up when my apartment isn't clean. My husband and I both aren't the best when it comes to doing the dishes as soon as we use them or cleaning up clothes right away. But I feel like I atleast take initiative and try. I feel he usually won't start cleaning on his own unless it's his own stuff or I practically yell at him to. I feel like I shouldn't even have to ask my partner to care about taking care of our home. I can't be the only one doing it. I'm honestly losing it because sometimes I get so frustrated and anxious I do get mad quickly. How do I change this? It's not even like I want to be mad it just happens because I've reached my limit mentally. I'm not on meds I wouldn't even know what to ask for.I feel like I just don't wanna have to ask him to clean anymore. Why can't he just do it on his own? I don't think I'm asking for a lot and I'm made to feel like a bitch or like I'm lecturing him when I'm all I'm doing is asking me to do some chores. In fact why do I even have to ask? I feel hopeless. I feel stuck. I can't afford a housekeeper every week right now. I can't control him. I just wanna know what I can do to manage my anxiety around this. And please no stupid advice like leave him because we are married. I know this issue can be fixed I just don't know where to start.,Anxiety

52430,Road Test anxiety I'm 21 years old and I don't have my liscence. I've taken the road test three times in the past year the last time I took it was on Thursday of last week. I bombed. Hard. I made sure I knew everything and what to do I'm decent for a new driver I know how to do a three point turn and my parallel parking is great I drive as much as possible with my mom and I made sure I was extremely prepared. However when I got in the car for the test I was panicking the whole time. I failed almost everything and everything in my brain got jumbled up. I'm not diagnosed with anxiety never seen a psychiatrist or been on meds or anything not how my family is but I am a deeply deeply anxious person I don't know how to get past this. My next test is in a couple weeks and I know I'm prepared and can drive and having my liscence would make my life so much easier but I'm so worried I'm never going to get it because of how anxious I get on the test. I just want to know if this is a shared experience and if anyone has any advice or anything. ,Anxiety

She told me I'm just going to get worse and that the medication will turn me into a lethargic zombie.

35420,I can't remember a day when I wasn't worried about dying... Hi allI'm a 26yo male that's been suffering from health anxiety for pretty much ever it seems. I've run the gauntlet of tests doctor visits and scans with my results always coming back negative yet I'm never satisfied. I always have this sneaking suspicion I'm the 0.1 that is sick and doctors cannot diagnose.For the past 2.5 years I've had a swollen lymph node 1cm on the side of my neck and lower on my neck I can feel multiple squishy tinier lymph nodes. I've had ultrasounds many times and even a biopsy for a swollen node in my groin that came back negative for anything strange. Today I found a swelling in my armpit and now I'm in crisis mode once again.Every day with this feels like a battle I must constantly convince myself that I'm healthy when deep down part of me believes I'm not. Every time I think I've made progress it all comes rushing back in like the tide and I'm completely derailed again. I'm so fed up with this and it's clearly no way to live. I never think about the future at all because I can't picture lasting long enough to have a future.I know this is kind of a rambling wall of text I just needed to get this out somewhere because everyone I talk to in my personal life just tells me what to do to feel better. To change my thoughts to eat healthier to be more active yet when these thoughts occur it's like I'm completely overwhelmed and I don't feel like I have a choice.I guess that's it.,Anxiety

35201,Mucus in Stool and Anxiety Do you guys have white mucus in your stool? I'm very anxious and very often worry about my health. As the rest of you here I survived numerous illnesses diseases and I always worried about them without real reason. In the last 2 years I have some white mucus with every stool. Sometimes barely noticeable sometimes more. Of course I'm freaking out and think about IBD cancer and the worst possible outcome. However I don't have any other symptoms. No abdominal pain no blood. I even don't fit into IBS those guys have much more troubles than me. If this is IBD or cancer I'm pretty sure I wouldn't feel well and would have more symptoms. I'm also one of those guys who afraid to be diagnosed thus I didn't visited a doctor yet. I had periods when I managed to convict myself that I'm fine and during that periods I have very small amounts of mucus. But a few days ago it become more noticeable then I started to examine my poops and freaked out. Of course now I have more and more of it. I'm curious if this could be my anxiety only? Do you guys ever noticed mucus in your stool?,Anxiety

51731,Advice greatly needed 26 year old female sorry for the long post Ive been on anti depressants for about the last 12 years of my life. I was always on 100 mg zoloft amp then switched to 20 mg lexapro in 2018 but went off of them for about 6 months in 2021 to try to live without them. At the end of those 6 months I started to get dizzy more often amp have what I can only describe as uncontrollable thoughts. Not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone but I just did not feel in control of my emotions and I felt like I was gonna lose my mind lol amp very depressed. So I got back on lexapro 20 mg amp after a few months I started to feel average at best but better than before. August 2022 I started to get brain zapsdizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start. I worked my way up to 75mg amp started to feel a lottttt better but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since. Very dizzy lots of anxiety amp panic attacks and the weird uncontrollable emotionsthoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since. It gets A LOT worse at night and thats when most of my issues arise.Within the last 6 months Ive seen an ear doctor to make sure I didnt have inner ear issues causing dizziness an eye exam I got a small prescription mostly for being on my phonecomputer or reading and I got an MRI done and saw a neurologist. All has always come back normal so Im thinking its a medication issue or lack of something. Im mostly looking for advice or comfort to make me feel better since Im not doing well lol.

35560,Swollen lymph node rash dermatits and surprise another lymph node today What the fuck is going on with my body?In October 2018 my perioral dermatitis flared up again after accidentally eating gluten. It was around the time of the holidays and i was stressed due to major family issues. December comes and I start to notice and itch on the back of my neck. I also notice after I eat a heavy meal I have this mild pain on the left side under my rib cage. Spleen? January the rash is a deep red unbearable itchy oozing and now paired with a swollen lymph node.I change up my diet to vegan because I figured it was keto catching up to me. That helped and the rash slooowwwwllly got better but still lingers. Fast forward to this week the itch is mostly gone but the lymph node is still there albeit smaller. Yesterday I finally got my hair done because I couldn't previously with it so itchy. I noticed a deep pimple on the opposing side of my scalp. This morning I now have a swollen lymph node where the pimple is. I also am hardly eatingnot very hungry and have managed to lose around 10lbs in a month but this could be due to vegan mostly raw diet. Of course I researched online and the worse is coming up lymphoma. I am absolutely panicked.

35575,Antibiotic cocktail and side effects Disgusting me has a bacterial infection in the stomach and I'll have to take 15 pills every day of antibiotics to get rid of it. Normally I won't take a look at the side effects because I know I will go insane about them but after my mother saw the prescription she said I should consider another form of antibiotic treatment that only has 70 success rate compared to 95 but less side effects. SO I looked up the side effects and its worse than anything I've ever taken. It's nausea and diarrhea and vomiting in over 10 of cases and a condition with black burnt skin and multiple organ failure with unknown probability. As I'm already vegetarian and you're not allowed to eat dairy products I have to go vegan for a week and I'm not allowed to go outside in the sun cause the medication will cause my skin to burn in the sun.I can't find the side effects for the other therapy but I also I want to be done with the whole thing if I survive the ten days. I'll probably take the pills but I will properly go crazy and miserable too.,Anxiety

34234,Spinning Downhill All Over Again PLEASE HELP! I haven't been to this sub in over a year. I started stressing about the things I was reading and freaking out more even though I just wanted to support others like they were giving me. I decided to stop googling stop this sub and try to re focus to feel some relief from the anxiety. 2018 has started out pretty rough issues with relationship stress and more stress have been a real struggle. Therapy hasn't been feeling the same neither does school which last year I was so happy to actually be doing. It's a sad time.Between all this I've tried different things to help me yoga some gym journaling hobbies etc. I realize that my life will forever be good and bad days....TODAY IS A BAD DAY! I'm overwhelmed and I'm not even out of bed yet.I feel asleep fine last night thankfully and sleep through most of the night again thankfully however I woke up at 530 to my right thigh twitching so quickly and non stop. Maybe I needed a stretch? No...Still going. It doesn't hurt but I've regrettable done something bad. I've let myself have bad thoughts then fueled them with the dreaded Google...PLEASE HELP.I saw where it could be just benign twitching...COULD BE. Last year I went to the gym and may have lifted wrong so the next day I had arm twitching almost all day. But for this case I haven't been to the gym since Monday! Now Wednesday. Can't be that...right?Stress can cause an overload of muscle stuff...even if I sleep? I'm dissecting everything right now. Yes it's been a hard month with you health fears and questions and stress but I'm now like thinking to myself I'm not really that stressed can that truly be the cause?Google sucks it's the worst type of fear enabler yet so accessible. I'm finding so much Lou Gherigs disease??? Ahh!!! I can see the twitch so that's promising but I'm finding it hard to no look up other symptoms...is it possible???Heart issues! I've always been focused on cancer and stuff along those lines but now I'm freak g about heart stuff. My fit bit typically sometimes shows a range of 58119bpm depending on exercise and relaxation etc. I didn't sleep with it last night but as soon as I saw the heart stuff on Google that heart arythmia and skipping beats I ran to put it on. It ran 54 bpm... then at 66 down to 61 bpm granted back In bed in my safe zone but what if my heart is beating too low??? It's slowly shutting off and gave me the leg twitch as a signal?!?! I'm terrified again upset I'm stressing out about this and worried I might not get out of bed today.Please help I could use any words or advice. So scared...,Anxiety

Fast forward I feel like my driver is taking too long I gave her a call and she sounded nervous and said shed be picking it up in a minute or so even though the app said the food had been picked up. Eventually brought my food about 20 min or so after the call. And now that Ive eaten it for some reason my mind only thought of anthrax... and how my nervous driver could have poisoned my food... So here I am full and satisfied... awaiting the appearance of any anthrax related symptoms and I guess the ol lights out after that...

35219,I got innocently bit by a feral kitten trapped in my house now I'm dying of course. Two feral kittens were eating food my family put out for them and our cat scared them so they ran inside the house. In the process of trying to literally herd cats one of them bit my knuckle while I tried fishing him out of the corner. I washed it with alcohol and soap for 10 minutes.After doing some Googling !!! I went to the ER two days later. I must have rabies!After explaining the situation the nurses and doctor were very reassuring that I probably didn't need a rabies vaccine. They said it was ultimately up to me but she said in my professional opinion I wouldn't get it. As it was expensive and insurance might not cover it.So I got a tetanus shot and antibiotics instead.Tetanus shot made me feel like trash and now I've had a the subtlest mildest of headaches for three days. It's so light I'm not even certain I have one half the time. I'm hyper aware of every muscle twitch I have. When my hands get cold I panic thinking they're going numb. I check to make sure I can still swallow.Any day now the headache will get intense and I'll wake up to my hand being completely numb. Then I'll go back to the ER and they'll tell me there's nothing they can do because I'm dead meat. It happened on the 9th and all of the feral cats appear fine still. Mom and dad cat and three kittens. None rabid or dying.But I'm still dying. And constantly on alert about my body. Does my head hurt or am I making it hurt by thinking about it so damn much?To make it worse I got taken off my Ativan ages ago because I switched doctors and the new one refuses to prescribe anything remotely addictive.Fml,Anxiety

35271,2 Week Rule Hi everyone!I wanted to share something very helpful I learned from this subreddit.While browsing one day I saw someone say that they wait to go to the doctor until they've been having symptoms for 2 weeks. I started thinking about that and it has helped me sooo much to internalize it.Whenever I have a weird symptom most days I tell myself this That's fine. Have something weird happen. I will go to the doctor in two weeks if it hasn't gotten any better. I will freak out then but I'm not going to worry about it until it's time to book the appointment. And believe it or not symptoms almost always disappear within a day or two.....I really hope that will help some of you too.

35843,Anxiety at it again over mice this time. What do you do to ease your mind? Ive had health anxiety in the past about rabies and amoeba. Each episode is weeks apart sometime a good couple months. Since Monday its been about hantavirus. Which I might add being in Australia there hasnt been any cases as of yet and to my knowledge dont have deer mice which are apparently a more common mouse to carry the virus. Nonetheless on Monday when I went into work there was some little black things on my desk that I thought was dried glue from work however turned out to be mouse poo. I only picked the one bit up before being told it was mouse poo then slid the rest onto paper towel with an aid so I didnt touch anymore with my hand directly. I then tossed it in the bin and washed my hands I could have touched my forehead prior to washing but I cant be sure. Anywho ever since then when I googled mouse poo originally just to see what it looked like and it lead me down a health anxiety hole so to say. There is some mouse poo around my area as I work near the kitchen however I didnt notice until I accidently picked a bit up off my desk with my bare hand. I know its unlikely to get Hanta I have posted in other threads however it doesnt ease my mind. How do you ease your mind when having anxiety over some disease?,Anxiety

35202,SO HAPPY I FOUND YOU ALL So i have been agorohobic and having panic attacks for 6 months now. I have SEVERE health anxiety and would LOVE TIPS.So basically I have chest pains not in the heart area. It's like far left under breast. Sharp pain sometimes I've had ekgs and blood tests and physicals. I cannot get over the fact something is wrong. Everyday. I'm afraid if I throw up I'm going to die. So being nauseous is my biggest fearI go to doctors every other week to get evaluated and I always get sent away. Sometimes I break down and just start to cry and say I can't die now. I'm so young. Please. I can't die. Help me. I don't want to die. over and over again becuase my toe hurts.I'm in therapy and working on it. It's ptsd from a year ago when a client I am a CNA I worked with closely felt a little sick and got out of the car and threw up and died as I did cpr and he bled all over me. Then 2 weeks later my grandma died. Then 2 weeks later two friends died of random heart attacks. Healthy 20 year Old college students with no history of drugs or alcohol. One was found on her bathroom floor and they found out she had an unknown genetic heart condition. The other was eating with his girlfriend and on the way home said he felt a little sick to pull over. He threw up and died of a heart attack there.Basically I'm terrified I have a brain tumor and my physical symptoms of my panic attacks are severe. I can't speak. My throat closes and I gag. I get cold sweats and I can't even get up to pee or drink water. Every single tiny little ache or pain in my body I fixate on for the whole day and Google 50 symptoms a day. I take my spo2 10 times a day. Blood pressure 8 times a day and heart rate 1530 times a day. I've never been diagnosed with any condition ever. I've never had high BP. My hr is 62.I'm 22 and terrified daily I will die any second and I'm working SOOOO hard to not live like this.

35350,Dealing with health anxiety for years... and how Im learning to move on from it Im no expert and I know everyone is different but Ive come a long way with my health anxiety and wanted to share a little of what I learned. On mobile excuse format and typosI once read something along the lines of our brain believes everything we tell it so if we start filling it with doubt and anxiety we create a world that is simply not true A year ago and I was telling myself every little symptom meant imminent death I worried about brain cancer breast cancer blood cloths etc etc etc. Im still in the process of completely desensitize myself from the most minimal sensations and Im still trying to learn how to really understand what my body is trying to tell me this is kind of how I learned to deal with it again I know not everyone is the same but hopefully this will be useful for someone If I can distract myself from the sensation or discomfort then its anxiety I call them sensations because any little thing I feel I wanna convince myself is pain even if its not. I try to ignore it if thats the case. My doctor always told me small sensations or symptoms are not a sign of anything serious.If its interrupting your day to day then take something for your symptom and try to move on eg. you have a sore throat then get something specifically for that If over the counter meds dont do it and its well over a week or so then Ill call my Doctor explain whats going on and see if I can come in for some answers and peace of mind. If you have multiple terrible symptoms then of course go check with your doctor asap. But the main thing is breathe friend. Dont freak out immediately dont google about it try to accept the thought and the sensations as exactly that thoughts and sensations and nothing more theyre not a sign of anything. Ironically life is not guaranteed for anybody no matter what but looking for symptoms constantly means youre wasting something you want to hold on to so desperately. Think about that I do it everyday. ,Anxiety

35857,Rash? Eczema? Scabies? ? Im and 18F student and ever since coming to college Ive had very bad health anxiety where as soon as any small thing is wrong Im online 810 hours a day trying to diagnose.My most recent issue is a rash Ive had on my forearms wrists and back of my hands for the past few days. Its very itchy mostly at night and when I scratch I get hivelike spots that sometimes stay and sometimes go away. I also have little white bumps that are very tiny and dont show up well in pictures. Ive been applying hydrocortisone 1 since Saturday night and its still happening so today I bought Benadryl cream and made an appt at my universities health services for tomorrow morning. After looking online Ive narrowed it down to hives eczema scabies or maybe ringworm. I think scabies scares me the most. I woke up this morning to myself scratching my wrists like crazy after doing so good not scratching and then I started hyperventilating because I was so scared because I have read scabies is worst at night. Also Ive been feeling itchy around my ears scalp and legs but nothing is as itchy or hive like as my wrists.Overall I dont really know what else to do as everytime I look at it I freak out and I cant talk to anyone about it because they laugh when I say it might be scabies or something serious.

52546,Crazy how powerful thought diaries amp breathing techniques have been for my anxiety I've been undergoing therapy for anxiety and depression for the past two months. My therapist recommended that I start keeping a thought diary to write down any worries or concerns that I may have and to practice a breathing technique that involves breathing in for four seconds holding for two and then exhaling for four seconds.Initially I was skeptical that these simple practices could make a difference in something that has troubled me for years. However I began to notice that whenever I started to become consumed by anxious or depressive thoughts jotting them down in my diary helped me immensely. This process allowed me to break down those thoughts and identify that 99 of the time my worries and depression stem from hypothetical situations.For instance one of my thoughts was What if my friends are judging me behind my back? for context this was after we went out for drinks. The key phrase in that being 'What if' meaning it's just hypothetical with no real evidence to back up the worry. So in my thought diary alongside my worrisome thought I would write down a 'Helpful thought' where I deconstruct this worry. For the aforementioned thought my helpful thought wasThis is a hypothetical worry you have no evidence to suggest this will happen. Your friend's opinion of you shouldn't be taken seriously anyway. You don't need to seek approval from your friends.Of course this may not help everyone but I wanted to share how thought diaries have helped my mental health and they can be quite powerful. TLDR My therapist recommended keeping a thought diary and practicing breathing techniques to help my anxiety and depression. Writing down my thoughts and using the breathing technique has helped me identify that 99 of my worries are hypothetical. I recommend trying it out.,Anxiety
34817,Being persistent with doctors or accepting the 'health anxiety' label and just accepting it? Whats your opinion. So to start off i'm a binge drug user so i occasionally binge on most things meth cocaine heroin etc so i recently developed health anxietyapparently along with lots of pricks and pains in my hands feet eyes pretty much anywhere really nothing chronic but enough to make me panic so i'm wondering should i persist with doctors to fix this or just deal with it. I'm so fed up with being afraid once i sat in the hospital emergency room parking lot snorting cocaine waiting for my heart to mess up so they could figure out the problem and fix itI know that is dumb lol. Just getting desperate and annoyed. Also along with health anxiety my drug use now is almost 0 due to the fear maybe a good thing? Sure doesn't feel so.,Anxiety

34031,Health Anxiety is ruining my life. So it all started getting worse when about three weeks ago I accidentally got hit in the forehead with a soft car seat... I wasn't knocked out or anything A amp E said I had no serious injuries no bruise etc. My Health Anxiety's like Well how do you know you're fine you should see a doctor again so that nothing new has come up.I go to the doctor I phone two different doctors and they tell me I don't have any signs of a serious head injury... I end up freaking out a few days later because of persistent headaches and feeling spaced out so I go to the A amp E again a different doctor gives me a neurological examination and tells me I don't have any serious injuries and should be more concerned about my anxiety. Then out of nowhere one of my relatives has a heart attack and is in hospital he's fine and well now and I start to worry. A few days after visiting him I'm at my boyfriend's house and lying in bed... I'm getting these headaches that have lasted about a week now as well as a sudden pain in my arm and chest and become totally convinced that I'm having a heart attack or a stroke. It doesn't help that I was starving myself because I was so stressed out I had lost half a stone in the space of a week. I thought that I was dying because I hadn't eaten and was having heart problems because of this.So now my HA brain thinks I've had a stroke twice without noticing or being diagnosed and that I have a damaged brain and that I also might have a brain tumour.I've not been able to smell or taste things as well since I got a minor bump on the forehead but it's quite possibly the case that my anxiety is convincing me I have these symptoms... so I've remained in this constant heightened state of numbness because of my anxiety believing that I have some sort of serious condition... I was even at an audiologist because I believed that a visit to the cinema had permanently damaged my hearing everything was fine and he said I had no hearing damage...I go to the doctor again because of my severe anxiety she tells me that all of my symptoms headaches ringing in ears loss of sense of smell are being caused by my anxiety. She prescribes me with propranolol... naturally I look up the side effects and become terrified to take the medication.Just today I started getting a headache and was convinced I was taking a stroke again. I've became kind of emotionally numb now because I'm constantly ruminating about what could be wrong with me healthwise. I can't even enjoy things anymore because my HA goes Well maybe you can't enjoy that or feel much emotions or think about that the same way as you did before because you have brain damage caused by an undiagnosed TBI or a stroke. I can't pay attention to things.It doesn't matter what the doctors say after a few hours I'm always convinced that they're wrong and that there's a serious problem with my brain and they haven't been able to find it yet.I'm so sick of this. Can anyone else relate?How do you convince yourself that there's nothing seriously wrong with you? ,Anxiety

Tomorrow I have to travel to NYC from CT which is a literal train ride plus the subway to get downtown and I am in a panic.

I have thoughts that I'm not being productive and that there arent many things I could do to be productive. This is what concerns me most. I'm doing a degree and that's the only productive thing I'm doing. I feel trapped in a boring lifestyle and i'm also living with my parents..

34492,Post TC anxiety Hi allJust venting some steam off here.So last August I found a lump I had a CT an op to remove my left testicle and then on 02 October was officially diagnosed with Stage 2a Testicular Cancer. Since then Ive had Chemo Radiotherapy and as of a few weeks ago my first Scans are normal meeting with the Onco. Hooray!That said the health anxiety Im experiencing is taking the piss. Every little ache twitch twinge anything makes me worry unnecessarily.As a result of the Radiotherapy my guts have been a bit iffy since but a recent toothache caused me to take a lot of Ibuprofen which together with the Radiotherapy caused me some really dire constipation. This lead to a hemorrhoid. Its internal and normally I cant feel it unless Ive sat on something cold in which case it throbs for a few minutes and then stops. Occasionally theres a spot or two of blood on my crap and one occasion I had such a large bowel movement that it turned the toilet water bright bright red but otherwise my bms are consistent size shape colour and bloodless they just scratch a little as they pass. Im improving my diet to include more fibre so hopefully itll sort itself out.Right now I want to concentrate on the future. Ive been given a new lease of life but I feel that all the residual after effects are holding me back and the worry over everything my body does is becoming quite a burden.,Anxiety

35212,Worried I could have contracted HIV at work I am a nurse who works in a doctor's office where we perform minor outpatient procedures for skin conditions. I was injecting a patient with local anesthetic lidocaine on the back. While injecting the lidocaine all of the sudden a stream of liquid started squirting out of the cyst I was injecting but only while I was injecting the anesthetic. It was clear liquid. It happened to squirt right on my mouth and lips. I was not wearing a mask at this point. I immediately wiped the area and then went and told the physician who I work with as I didn't know if it was just anesthetic that has come out or was whatever the cyst was consisting of. He stated that he would be able to tell as soon as he got in there to remove it. He injected more anesthetic and he same stream of liquid came out of the same location. He assumed it was likely lidocaine the medicine coming out of a pore. I was surprisingly fine right after it happened but now I am so concerned about any exposure to blood borne pathogens hep c and hiv as I am vaccinated against hep b. I am not sure if I was exposed to blood as it was only whatever liquid it was that splashed onto my mouth. I am concerned because my lips were dry and slightly cracked and I had a small very small cut as well. Being a medical professional myself I understand how those diseases are spread and I don't want to be unreasonable in my worry. There is just a part of me that wonders if there was blood mixed in with the fluid as I was injecting anesthetic with a needle and there was some small amount of blood on his skin from previous pokes with the needle and that the crackscut on my lips could have been exposed to any virus. The physician stated he would be glad to have the patient and myself tested if I am concerned but he does not seem too concerned himself. I know there is also no difference in testing the patient at this point or waiting to get tested myself in a few weeks as the outcome would be the same. I am simply wanting to hear if anyone has any thoughts and wanted to vent. As far as I know the patient was healthy and not HIV or hep c though there is no way to be sure without a test. This is my first real exposure to any body fluids in my career so I am very curious what others think or to get any advice on how to calm my mind. I am already planning to get myself tested in a few weeks once the typical window period of infection has passed. I know having the patient tested would be the easiest way for me to get quick results and relief from anxiety but I do not want to offend the patient either. I am getting sick with worry! Thank you in advance to anyone who responds. I appreciate you listening. ,Anxiety

35539,Heart anxiety is back thanks to weird arm pains My anxiety is back. This time this weird arm pain that extends from my elbow to my hand is triggering it. Logically I know that it's likely due to the fact that I tend to lean on my left arm but my brain keeps telling me well what if it isn't? The pain usually happens when I'm resting my arm on my leg or have it bent to some capacity it happened about 5 or so times during an hour video game session but I've been lying in bed and it hasn't happened since. It doesn't seem to get worse with exertion either as I run and do other cardio and weights at least 4 times a week. It just comes and goes seemingly at random.I want to believe it's nothing wrong and it's a nerve thing at worse. My mind won't let me. To it any arm pain like this is impending doom.

Now she could of done that because i pissed her off constantly asking if she had hiv or she did it because she found out she did and did not want to be sued. two weeks after the sex my anxiety kicked in and i thought i had every symptom but a week later i found out that i had a 0.04 chance of contracting it so it went away. fast forward to today i am having daily headaches sometimes accompianed my nausahuge hiv sympom. i had a 98 fever for one day last week and also had a leg cramp one day and sometimes would get some aches in my arm maybe hiv or anxiety. Im scared out of my mind right now. The only reason i had sex was because i was feeling kind of depressed and thought sex would help. Little did i know that i was going to contract hiv from it . I will be a medical phenomenom i can already see the headlines 17 year old depressed boy has sex to make himself feel better ends up contracting HIV instead. I can't go to the doctor or get a test because im not 18 either. So i have to wait 4 more months until i find out i have HIv,Anxiety

52586,Had a really bad turn the last few days Hi everyone I've had anxiety for the last 6 months or so in varying levels. From January I was in a decent headspace with it but the last three weeks it's got worse and then the last four days or so it's gone off a cliff. It's all I think about all day long I had panic attacks on Monday and Wednesday and my heart is racing all day. Where before I'd wake up rested now I wake up with my heart racing and frequently my muscles are spasming which is scary. The thought of doing normal stuff feels impossible and I can't shake this feeling I can't get better than this ever again. I spoke to my doctor on Thursday and he prescribed propranolol which I took yesterday for the first time which helped with the body stuff but my mind was still racing.Has anyone experienced similar and have any tips? I feel like this is really really bad and worse than most people have anxiety.,Anxiety
35242,Can't stop coughing! Hey everyone I'm new to this subreddit but was wondering if anyone else has gone through this and had any advice. For about a year now maybe longer? I've had a dry cough. Like I cough like crazy every day. When I go to the doctor they say everything sounds fine no liquid or anything. I even had them test me for asthma and my breathing tests came back normal. At this point I'm pretty sure my coughing is just a nervous tick that stems from my health anxiety... which is pretty severe. I do get acid reflux and I have bad seasonal allergies but neither of those things caused my cough before a year or so ago. I guess I'm kind of obsessed with making sure my lungs are clear especially if water or something accidentally goes down the wrong pipe. When that happens I cough nonstop to the point where it hurts. Aside from being annoying and embarrassing I find that I've been getting a lot more chest pain from time to time and my throat hurts. So does anyone else do this? Do you have an advice on stopping? I just really want to stop. Thanks!,Anxiety
35779,Reinforcing Anxiety by going to the doctor Recently I have been thinking about whether or not I should go to the doctor for the bigger problems I can't seem to shake. I was told a while back I had a lesion in my leg that was most likely benign and then that was it. I didn't hear anything back from any doctor about it and I didn't know where to go or what to do about it and my HA went through the roof because of it. I recently went to my main doctor and asked him about it. He told me they can't legally say 100 something is benign because they can be sued over it but reallistically it most likely was benign. He said that I could always get an xray if I needed reassurance to make sure it hasn't changed ar all. My question is this what do you guys think you would do in my position? I have had enough radiation in my body already and I want to avoid it as much as possible. And I feel like maybe not going and getting the xray can teach me more skills that I need to cope. I know something is there but I still have to live my life. And trust in my faith of God.I appreciate any advice.,Anxiety
34363,Can't stop obsessing.. Any tips? Sorry if this is a little long but I'm new here and desperately looking for some advice. Plus it kinda helps to get it all off my chest.. I've been struggling with health anxiety for a little while now and although I keep kidding myself that I'm in control I don't feel very in control. I can't stop the constant worrying and obsessing.It all started just over a year ago when I spent a week in hospital. I'm not going to go into detail as to why as I don't want to trigger anyone else's anxiety... But it wasn't a great week.Since then I've been fine. I have ibs which is unfortunate as the symptoms I get seem to really trigger my anxiety. But that's the most serious problem I have. A few other minor things asthma skin problems but nothing unmanageable.I noticed my anxiety levels shifting around a year on from my hospital stay. Think it must have just been on my mind then I had a really bad ibs flare up that threw me. Was off my food had no energy and lots of other unpleasant things.Ibs is more under control now but my anxiety is not. I feel anxious in general have quite a foggy head alot of the time don't really feel like myself don't want to do much getting tired out easy feel like crying alot. But mostly I'm struggling because I can't stop obsessing about every little thing wrong with me.The slightest cramp or ache sends me spiraling into a panic. I can't stop googling things to find out if there is something wrong with me. Even though I don't really have any ongoing symptoms and they are more one offs. Can't stop poking and prodding looking for lumps or enlarged lymph nodes.Any time I find the tiniest little lump found one or two in the fat layer on my stomach I obsess. Can't seem to stop looking for it to see if I can find it again. Most of the time I can't any if I find anything it's tiny so logically I know it's nothing to worry about. But I just can't stop.It really feels like it's taking over. I just feel like I'm stuck in an endless obsessive cycle of prodding being hyper aware of every tiny sensation looking for things wrong with me a constantly googling.It's got to the point that when I have a nice symptom free day I find myself looking for something that's wrong with me as I feel like i can't trust that I'm actually ok.Anyone got any advice or been in a similar situation? This isn't something I find easy to open up about but I'm scared it's going to completely consume me if I don't do something. ,Anxiety

So this past weekend I went to a college reunion with people I hadn't seen in 7 years. We went out one night and a friend asked if I smoked I said no. He handed me his vape and said try this. I did and hit it a few more times through out the night. Well at the end of the reunion weekend he revealed to a friend that he had been HIV for several years and currently has his virus controlled and undetectable. But needless to say it was a very stressful drive home. I had one of the worst HA freak outs I have had in years and didn't eat for 48 hours I was so nervous. I could hardly get out of bed!Thankfully I have been reassured that HIV is not passed via saliva even though I've what if'ed the hell out of the situation. Of course I will still test to confirm but I learned so much about HIV in particular through this experience which has helped mitigate my anxiety. ,Anxiety

I keep falling back asleep after I hit snooze and I have intense dreams right away then my alarm goes off again and the same repeats until I drag myself out of bed because I'm too hungry. I am extremely tired all day as if I had multiple sleepless nights in a row while I actually sleep 11 hours per night.

I feel like I can't function properly I'm sluggish and think slowly my mind is clouded. My eyes keep going out of focus randomly. When someone talks to me their voice echoes in my head as if it was waking me up while I'm already up and awake. I randomly start falling asleepzone out even when standing up and get a falling sensation when trying to resist. It's true I had insomnia for awhile and whatnot but I don't know why I keep being so tired now that I am sleeping. I do wake up multiple times per night because my mouth is dry or because I have to pee or other things but it's not really new.

51702,Why can't I believe what the doctors tell me? I 26 M am super frustrated with myself today I had a cardiologist appointment bc I have palpitations sometimes and my heart races randomly when I have acid reflux. The cardiologist did some blood pressurepulse checks to rule out POTS and said I was fine on that front. The EKG came back great and he said my heart was in excellent shape. I even asked him to order a take home monitor for me just for some peace of mind and he was ok with that. I had an echocardiogram done about 1 year ago with a different cardiologist and everything came back great. Now as I get home from the doctor my anxious brain gets to plotting and is now worrying that He didn't order you another echocardiogram what if he's missing something. My rational brain believes and trusts this doctor very much but the anxiety part of my brain just wants to create more worry for any reason it can find. Can anyone give me some advice or insight? Is there even any Medical reason I would need a second echocardiogram 1 year later? I assume it detects defects that have been there probably from birth so a second one is probably pointless but it's hard to tell my anxious brain that. I Just want to believe the doctors when they give me positive news and believe that I'm fine.Edit I should note I am very aware that I have health anxiety and I am currently in therapy for it already It still bugs me though.,Anxiety

Sure I googled symptoms all the time especially because one of my enflamed lesions was causing me chronic nausea for more than a month leading me to finally start on my google journey again and begin to go down the rabbit hole of different problems I could possibly have. Until I got double vision I was almost convinced I had esophagus cancer. It was crazy. I googled stuff all the time cried over things I might have worried about it till I fell asleep. But I never really expected the new thing called MS i saw in passing was actually going to end up being me. It was crazy. Every single part. And as you can already expect it's fueling even more even worse anxiety as I try to figure out some current bowel problems that have been plaguing me since my diagnosis last year. Today I made it a job for me to find out what is going on. I've made my way up to taking 290 mg of Linzess a day and still deal with constipation unless I decide to have a fun day out. I always have to go to the bathroom anyway throughout the day whether or not I actually end up going. I started having lower right dull pain halfway into my newfound constipation and was told the linzess would help. It didn't. Then we decided to try more. It helped for a week. I'm vaguely aware or trying to convince myself that drinking more water should help because I'm supposed to with linzess or i risk becoming dehydrated but its been hard to keep up with. TMI but because I'm nervous and desire opinions I must go on. My stools are pale and light a lot of the time. Yellow or white mucus covers some of it and half of it floats half doesn't... Most times I go I bleed a little after and this past time quite a lot. A bright red glop of blood which just didn't seem right for what could've been a hemorrhoid or something else. I usually always feel some kind of discomfort or dull pain in my abdomen across the lower side usually and recently I even had a blood test taken that said my blood count was low. This may be because for MS reasons I'm trying to cut down on red meats and aren't getting enough iron... But it doesn't seem right. At all. All these symptoms line up. down to the anemia. I'm worried beyond compare of anything else before. Nothing from anyone helps because they're just repeating their words before my MRI. I'm scared. I already panicked and cried and called mom and I'm going to tell my neurologist tomorrow to see what she has to offer in guidance. I can only hope I'm not this unlucky... getting two incredibly rare health problems for my age and form and everything else in the same damn year even. I just don't even know where to start at dealing with this.,Anxiety

35622,Bad Tattoo Experience making me lose my mind I got a large elbow tattoo Wednesday and it's RUINED my mental since to make a very long story short basically the tattoo artist wasn't as clean as I'd like him to be he didn't even wash his hands before putting on his gloves and tattooing me the needle and grip were new but the tattoo wire was not covered in plastic or the workspace. He says that he uses a very strong cleaner between every client but my mind doesnt want to accept it.ampx200BTo make it all worse he didn't do the tattoo i even wanted and did a fucking terrible job so now i have a huge bad tattoo with a terrible story with it and just waiting til i can lazer it off. ampx200BI can't stop thinking I could've got hiv or hepatitis c because of this do you guys think I am being crazy? I went to my doctor and asked the opinion of many people in the tattoo and health field and they all say I'm fine but I can't stop thinking that I could've ruined my entire life and it wasn't even my fault.ANY ideas on how I can make myself feel better? Thank you,Anxiety
52074,Blonde highlights Hello first time posting here but I feel like I'm going to explode.So a few weeks ago I got the amazing idea to get blonde highlights like a balayage. I don't know if it's because how the hairstylist did them because my hair is wavy or I'm just this insecure. But now every time that I see myself on the Kinrara I hate my hair so much like what the he'll I did to my precious color.I'm thinking to get dyed at home because I can't deal anymore with hairstylists and giving explanations but it makes me SO ANXIOUS to not get a color that matches my hair. I just want my highlights to dissappear.I'm feeling like a mess and I don't know how to proceed and I don't want to hear the others saying how I'm wasting my money after getting the highlights . I just want to feel peace at something.,Anxiety

34632,Excessive neem oil Today my skin was in flaming. I was getting frustrated and angry so I used heaps of moisturizer then neem oil.While applying my skin was feeling iffy and I noticed my heart racing. I wasn't sure if this was because I was getting anxious or not so I stopped and went online and looks up the dangers of neem oil.I only used it externally but I used quite a lot. Was I getting poisoned? Should I be taking precautions I'm unsure. I took a quick shower to try to rinse off the excess.Sorry if I'm just wasting time. ,Anxiety
34146,Is it normal to get screened for psychosis even though I dont have any symptoms of it??? Ok let me explain what is going on. Hope some of you can relate to this. My anxiety is through the roof.Couple of years back I had stressinduced panic anxiety with all the classic symptoms rapid heartbeat crazy tensions panic attacks fatique etc.. My doctor had a hard time telling me what was going on and I kept coming to the worst conclusions gt this gave me some crazy health anxiety and the fear of dying. I came over this in a year and haven't had any of this for 2 years straight.Now 4 months ago I start to feel a little depressed nothing major I assumed it was due to the winter coming messed up sleeping pattern and life just being a bit boring. This threw me right back into the health anxiety. Thoughts racing constantly about why I got depressed what is happening to me am I going crazy etc. I went to the doctor saying that I felt off a bit emotionally numb and racing thoughts 247. I took a depression test there but kinda showed nothing so the doctor kept asking me questions about hallucinations and delusions which I have had nothing of never. I went back a couple of more times assuming something physical was wrong with me or atleast something crazy that messed with my cognitive abilities. Got the same questions again and again.So I slowly started thinking about the questions what if I am gonna hallucinate see stuff that isnt there etc. Now I am stuck here with some 247 dpdr constant hyperawareness and crazy anxiety about hallucinating or going psychotic or something. It's like my brain is in super defence mode recognizing everything that changes in my surroundings telling me to reality check everything so I am sure that I am not going crazy. I feel so off.I went to my doctor again and told her about the fear of going crazy or developing schizophrenia. And she sent me to a psyciatrist with the reference of me being psychotic. When I read the reference I had a fullblown panic attack I just froze. This made my anxiety 100x worse than before thinking that I must be super crazy.Recently I went to the psyciatrist who asked me the same questions about delusions and halluciations and I described again the same things. That I've never had them never had any delusions. But I am starting to think whenever I see something delusional thoughts pop up in my head because of my obsession about the fear what if I thought someone were actually following me etc.. all kinds of intruisive thoughts that I know for a fact that is no were near real but just scary that that they pop up in my head all the damn time. I used some metaphors there at the interview and I think she might have gotten the totally wrong idea of what I told her. Because now I am being sent off to an interview about schizophrenia and psychosis because she thinks I am that apparently even though I don't have any symptoms at all. She even gave me a temporary diagnosis as a schizophrenic wtf.This is throwing me off what the f is happening. Am I losing control I can't believe this is happening. Is this normal to get screened for??? I feel so detatched right now stuck in full blown overanalyzing mode of my surroundings I can't relax. What if I am going schizophrenic or psycotic????Sorry for my grammar my anxiety has never been worse.,Anxiety
51869,Tell me it gets better . . . My almost 10yearold is six weeks into Prozac started at 10 mg and went to 20 mg about 3 weeks ago. We're seeing violent outbursts almost nightly this week the whole reason we started this was because of these but they weren't nightly at the time. He'll be fine during the day and then everything goes south when bedtime hits. All the anxieties of the day start invading his thoughts and suddenly he's hitting pulling hair kicking saying he wants to kill us he wants to die. Full blown anger. I have to hide every single thing in the house that could be used as a weapon. Is this part of the process? My husband and I are trying to be calm and patient and use tools to help calm him down using your senses breathing with a stuffed animal on your belly name it to tame it but I just can't live like this. All day I dread bedtime and what it's going to bring. The thought of going through all this yet again tomorrow makes me sick. I need to know this will get better and we'll find the best way to help and get to the other side of this. It's so hard.,Anxiety
35491,Positive thinking for others whose HA is cancer based the what ifs So my health anxiety is almost entirely grounded in cancer. Today Im worried about lymphoma and brain cancer. A month ago it was lung and digestive cancers. Before that leukemia and before that bone cancer. You get the gist. My dad was diagnosed with cancer and did pass away from it. Before you freak out he was older active but poor poor diet his whole life. History of alcoholism. I mention this because its good context for my issues. My health anxiety spirals every year around this time JanMar when he was sick. Even though I know many many statistics about age of diagnosis and general health and this and that it doesnt always stop the worrying as many of you are well aware. I tend to catastrophise. If I feel bad it must be cancer and since its cancer Ill die a painful death in a couple months. I typically avoid cancer stories as they trigger me up pretty badly duh but today I stumbled across a story of a 27 year old guy who was diagnosed with a rare brain cancer a few months ago. Today he announced he was cancerfree. The world isnt perfect and it isnt always fair. There are lots of what ifs. But I think its so so so important to remember the what ifs are conjecture and NOT fact. So you go through the thing your lymph nodes are swollen. Youre probably a little sick with a cold or maybe youve been poking your neck non stop for weeks to check. So you probably dont have lymphoma. Okay but what if you do? Honestly youd probably be fine. This is not ALWAYS the case. But if we go by percentages 99 of your worries are not cancer or malignant or serious at all. 75 of that 1 of real and serious conditions respond well to treatment. Theres variance but this is a great time in history to have cancer. Treatments are so plentiful and effective. Maybe you DO have brain cancer but so? That 27 year old kid did. Hes alive and well. To be abundantly clear I think its most important to challenge false conclusions first and foremost. Challenge your worries. If youre in a rut though and you just cant shake the feeling that THIS TIME is has to be cancer I just know it has to be stay optimistic! We are a community of worriers. Challenge yourself to think of best case scenarios even if theyre within the worst case. Im here with you if youre scared of something today. And Im so positive that we will get through it just fine I want you to be positive of that as well ,Anxiety
34930,heart skipping beats so for the past seven months since a wisdom tooth surgery that did not go well my anxiety has been more healthrelated as well as manifesting physically. i have intense dizzy spells stomach discomfort etc. when i am especially anxious. today i sat down after doing some cleaning and noticed my heart seemed to be skipping beats. i am not the most fit individual but this was pretty loweffort activity and my heart was POUNDING. and every 1015 beats it seemed to skip one. i started freaking out worrying that my heart was going to stop. i just went to the doctor the other day for a UTI and they didn't notice anything off about my pulse so i hope i am just crazy. fuck fuck fuuuuck.,Anxiety
34923,I dont wanna be like this anymore Ive been dealing with health anxiety ever since my mom was diagnosed with cancer. Every time I have some symptom I google for hours until ive convinced myself I have days left to live and have to go to the doctor right away. I saw my doctor yesterday and I could tell he thought I was insane and told me to stop googling stuff. Its honestly so embarrassing and I feel like I have no control over myself anymore. He referred me to a psychologist within the first like 5 minutes of us talking. Im just embarrassed and everyone around me is so annoyed with me constantly thinking I have some issue. I wish I could just get over this. rant ,Anxiety
35405,Afraid of hospital infection Well I do not want to rationalize my fear of hospital infection however if we look at the stats hospital infection rates are significantly higher than before. I will have an arthroscopic knee debridement surgery the procedure just needs two 48 mm incisions basically. Usually patient would be discharged after a few hours of waking up or stay one night at hospital in some cases. I know in every surgery there is a chance of infection and I know that my surgery is one of the easiest surgeries available too. However I am really afraid to get an hospital infection. I had 4 surgeries before but the nearest one was 7 years ago when I was 17 years old. I am almost 5 inches taller64' and 100 pounds heavier now300lbs currently. I mean when we put all those things together these make me anxious. To sum upI am really scared of hospital infection even though my surgery is pretty easy and incisions will be just 8 mm max.I am slightly afraid of anesthesia since my body changed a lot in last 7 years.What are your thoughts? Thank you guys!Have a great sunday! ,Anxiety
52360,My health anxiety is spiralling I just got back from an eye check up for a new set of contact lenses and the optometrist told me my eyes are healthy and I just have a few eye freckles theyre on the whites of my eyes and are light grey. After the appointment KNOWING he said my eyes were fine I went into a rabbit hole and googled eye freckles and found out that in rare circumstances they can turn cancerous. I felt sick to my stomach and want to go back to an optometrist to get them removed but I know Im sending myself into a spiral. Its been about two hours now and Im starting to calm down about it all trying to tell myself that if anything was wrong I would be told. But I hate this.

34429,Recurring chest pain for around a month So I started having pain on the left side of my chest on the inner part of my pec towards the top. It happens mainly when I exhale. Kind of a sharp pain. It sometimes happens on the tail end of taking a deep breath. Movement doesn't increase it. The pain hasn't increased. It's possible that the frequency at which it happens has. I had an appoint two weeks ago and had an ekg and blood tests which neither of which showed abnormalities. Im a 29 yo male who has exercised on and off for most of my life. Only problem I have is decently high cholesterol. I called the doctor today and they made a referral to a cardiologist on Apr 21. I want to think that's to much I hope. My first worry goes to endocarditis.. Other than that I don't know what to think of it. It's hard not to worry about it. I want to assume its inflammation but I've never experienced something this consistent for so long.,Anxiety

51906,Anxiety Impacting Visual Ability and Causing HyperFixation on Partners Physical Appearance Hi allI hope I could get some opinions from the kind followers of this subreddit!For as long as I 27 M could remember I had pretty intense anxiety. As a result I overthink and selfsabotage a lot. About 2.5 months ago I got into a relationship with a phenomenal woman 21F. Shes so driven smart witty and funny and at first I was sure that she was absolutely gorgeous. However these past few days Ive been wondering if I truly am attracted to her. I know this is weird but when i look at pictures of her I find myself analyzing her facial features without even realizing it. I am constantly quizzing myself on whether I like her or not. This isnt the first time it has happened. I remember the first time I went on vacation with my one and only ex I suddenly started to hyper fixate on each of her features and started to see her differently if that makes any sense. Instead of seeing a coherent face i saw a collection of facial features. Her nose seemingly looked larger and the proportions were all off. Again I know this sounds so weird. I pushed those thoughts aside and eventually got over it she broke up with me for a completely unrelated reason.Im wondering if anyone has been through this as well? Part of me thinks Im shallow for worrying about this. But part of me wonders if its the anxiety thats causing this.Thank you!,Anxiety

35191,Hearing loss At what point do I talk to my doctor about not being able to hear well. I've noticed more and more struggling to hear. Last time I asked she said I just had fluid in my ear and said it would be fine. It's been 6 months since then and I've switched doctors because of her being dismissive on other things. Rolling eyes laughing at me etc. I had the flu between then and now. And after the flu it seems like it had gotten a lot worse. And being in public with hearing issues is making my anxiety skyrocket. What really scares me even more is my mom had a tumor removed from her ear area that was causing hearing loss. What do I do? Can anyone comfort me? Is this a reason to go to the walk in or do i need to make a regular appointment? I would of talked to the doctor the 8th but I've had such horrible times with doctors I ended up cancelling because I was having such bad anxiety attacks. I ordered pizza instead to calm myself it didn't help I'm not on any anxiety medication. Or anything but birth control. ,Anxiety

34107,I'm convinced I have HIV. I've had a bit of HIVphobia for a while now and I realize now it was mostly unfounded. But this summer it got worse. I have no job right now and I wasn't going to school so I spent most of the summer inside to an unhealthy extent. When I did go out for long enough I developed a rash that I think is PMLE which is a mild allergy to sunlight not fun but harmless. Then I saw that it can be a symptom of HIV infection. Granted I've never had this reaction before. The page said it can develop around my age and nearnonexistent sun exposure mixed with periods of high exposure can probably cause reactions like that especially since it was a pretty brutal summer but I'm still terrified.Around this time I also started to develop these purplish veinlike patterns on my legs and that just made me panic even more because I couldn't just explain that away. I am overweight and I think I gained some weight during the summer so I thought of stretch marks but aren't those usually white? They seem to be going away now but that's only a little comforting.I've never done drugs or even had sex. But I remember finding an unexplained cut on my finger a few years ago that I'm afraid might have been from a needle in the trash where I worked at the time. I don't remember exactly when that happened. I haven't been getting sick often or having issues with infections but would I really notice those things if my immune system wasn't working properly? Isn't the immune system where most of the symptoms come from?I still haven't been going out as much as I probably should and I realize that I probably have a severe vitamin D deficiency so that might be causing some of this but I don't know if it can explain everything. I keep checking my skin for any changes fearing the worst. I'm really scared.,Anxiety
34865,Lymph node just...gone? 21M Ive been worried about lymphoma for over a year now. I had a lump in my armpit that I didnt know if it was a lymph nodecystmusclenothing at all for over a year. It never grew changed anything. I check it from time to time and get anxious once in a while but have gotten it relatively under control the anxiety. Anyways I go to the gym today like any other normal day come home to shower and its....not there? I cracked my shoulder at the gym but nothing else out of the ordinary I did work shoulders and its just not sticking out like it did and Im thoroughly confused and quite honestly anxious for no reason at all. I have been dealing with a shoulder injury for as long as I can remember as well. Where did it go? Was it not a lymph node then? Its still the slightest bit asymmetrical from my right armpit but not like usual. Was it likely not even a lymph node then? Ive been told that if it remained unchanged for so long 14 months from noticing it that its either unlikely a lymph node or just a shotty one. Its rare that lymphoma would leave the same node unchanged for such a long time I was told. ,Anxiety
35446,Just gotta say today was really tough I recently got hired at a fast food restaurant and today was my third day of training. While my trainer was going over some things I got this pain beneath my shoulder blade that felt really sharp when I breathed in. I started internally panicking worried something was wrong and I was gonna mess up at my new job because I didnt want to leave early or make anyone worry and I didnt want to die in the bathroom etc. I felt a panic attack starting my chest felt heavy and I felt so scared I was convinced something was wrong with my lungs since it was hard to breathe as well. I managed to keep myself from having a panic attack and pushed through my shift even though I got a bad headache for the last hour of it. I got home exhausted. Im still scared that something is wrong with my lungs. Health anxiety is so incredibly exhausting. I hate waking up every day worrying about dying. Its so hard just to work at this minimum wage job. Its just really tiring. I feel like crying.,Anxiety

34664,Stomach related cancer Hey guys....I've been having problems with my stomach lately it started on September. Basically I had tons of things to do on my uni got really stressed out and started feeling like my stomach or better yet the area above it felt heavy. I started running by that time and I ran almost every day until the real winter kicked in around two month period. I also started eating more healthy and I stopped eating after 7PM for quite some time. While I ran I almost felt as if a weight was in my chest and as if it was jumping while I was running so I visited my doc.In the meantime I lost quite some weight. I was usually around 100kg 5 and last time I tracked my weight I was at 83.The doc basically said it's all stress related and she took my blood urine and stool sample.Stool gt negative for H. PyloriUrine gt everything good except high amount of proteins in urine I had wisdom teeth extracted and took antibiotics a week before so I'm not sure if it's related to that if anyone has something smart to say regarding this...please doBlood gt All goodShe gave me a prescription for Controloc pills proton pump inhibitor and told me to take them for two weeks at least.Well newsflah. I'm stupid. First of all I started taking them and the situation improved. So I stopped taking them after around 5 days forgot one day and figured oh well if it doesn't hurt it's fixed. Then another period of high intensity workload on uni arrived and so did the pain. I started taking them again but for a week and it improved a little. Later I figured I won't be my own doctor and I stopped taking them so for a while I felt just a minor annoyance above stomach but nothing alarming or hurting so I ignored it.Now back to another high intensity period my stomach is going crazy again I google telling myself not to do it but hey I said I'm stupid didn't I?The moment I read about bla bla cancers of this and that caused by gastritis I totally lost it.If I had these symptoms on and off considering I didn't take my meds as I was supposed to how bad did I fk up my stomach? Could this half a year have made any permanent damage? I'm terribly afraid of well...pain doctors disease and death nice combo in fact so nice that it keeps me scared but not scared enough to face my fear of doctors and operations.Yesterday it was hell I took 2x20mg Acipan same thing as Controloc basically and I feel a lot better but my mind is still in a terrible place. I guess this turned out into a rant rather than a question but still... any comments are welcome.sidenote I read that the usual period of taking controloc or similar pills for such symptoms is at least 4 weeks considering I didn't take even 14 of the given time is it possible it's simply the gastritis coming back every time?,Anxiety
51875,Week long attack I was diagnosed with GAD three years ago but have declined treatment in the form of long term medicine probably due to my medical anxiety go figure. I would describe my attacks as completely random and not stemming from outside situations typically. For instance i will be laying in bed watching a funny show and suddenly feel like an elephant is on my chest. Two weeks ago i found a man hiding under my car in my driveway. I chased him off and called the police. Turns out he crashed his car up the road and was hiding from the police. I was worked up that day and the next but have been able to feel comfort knowing this wasnt some weird targeted attack on me. But a desperate man in desperate times or however the saying goes lol.However my physical symptoms have not left. My chest constantly feels heavy and i cannot get a good breath. I almost have to force myself to yawn to feel like im getting that deep breath. Its affecting my life mostly limiting my physical movements and causing headaches assuming from constantly forcing a deep breath. I dont have a pcp i can call for advice. But I feel like enough is enough and i would like to be able to breathe normally again. My mom has copd so I have a pulse ox around and my oxygen has been consistent at 9899 so i can mostly confidently say this is anxiety. My issue is do i call a doctors office and wait weeks to be seen? Or go to an urgent care pay 150 for them to tell me this is just anxiety? Ultimately what are my options here? I just want to feel normal again,Anxiety

35543,Hows do you differentiate between imagined problems and real problems? Long rant Since I was probably 1920 I have had a roller coaster of health anxiety. It all started with an actual kidney issue which later resolved itself and the only possible cause was stress. Since then I have had a huge fear of STI's which led to my ultimate fear of cancer and warts caused by HPV especially throatmouth. I have always had some form of anxiety when I was younger I'd pull out my eyelashes and scour my face for blemishes. I believe this has led to me being so hard on my self that I notice any imperfection. I have tonsil stones and while I stuck my finger down my throat I went past my tonsils this time gross I know and I felt a bump almost like a skin tag. This led to me feeling so panicked I became physically ill and left work early. Since then I've been googling and come to the conclusion that I can't keep doing this to myself. Normal people do not stick their fingers down their throat to find god knows what. Of course It's going to feel weird down there.I understand this new thought will not pass immediately but how do you guys differentiate real vs imagined issues? How do you calm yourself down? I am at my wit's end my gf is too. I'm sick of being withdrawn and lying to her about what's wrong. I'm sick of going down rabbits holes for hours on end. I'm sick of physically checking my self countless times. I'm just sick of it. Sometimes the only times I find any relief is when I am in actual distress from a confirmed ailment and that's just sad.,Anxiety
34221,Heart anxiety pvc vt and cpvt Hi there. I want to begin to tell you that I have suffer from health anxiety for few years. I was actually good for 3 years until 10 weeks ago. Last two years I've had skipped beats. Doctor told me it was probably pvc and did no test. I believed him and continued with my life. These skipped beats would happened when in rest so I wasn't worried. Last year I had a hernia surgery and I couldn't run for 4 month's. Then last summer I noticed when I started running that my heart would skip beats or flutter more frequently during excersice. Sometimes just 12 times but sometimes 10 times. I saw a cardiologist and he did ECG echo stress test. My heart is structurally normal and everything looks fine except 1 pvc during stress test. I didn't have any anxiety and continue working out. Than 10 weeks ago I was running. I'm not in good shape because I'm scared of exercising. Everything went fine until I had pvc. I continued running and got few in a row! my heart started pumping and I felt numbness and my heart was getting pvc A LOT. I thought I was going to faint but I didn't. My friend called the ambulance. I freaked out When they came my pvc had stop and I just had 150 bpm. ECG showed nothing. Had a blood test as we'll and 2 more ECG which showed nothing. Docs told me nothing to worry about. I was fine until week ago when I was watching tv and relaxing. I noticed chest tingling. I took my pulse and it was fast. I had a panic attack and skipped beats few in a row. I called a ambulance and they did ECG 2x and there we're no sign of anything. My skipped beats were not happening when they came. I had a holter and I'm waiting for the results but it only captured skip bear while at rest. I'm trying to get on with my life but I can't take this anymore. I'm so anxious. Deep down in my heart I worry so much that I have Venticular tachardia because of those skipped beats while excsersising or panic attacks. They came more than 3 in a row and that is suppose to be a bad sign. I want to believe my doctors but I can't get it out of my head that they have never capatured my heart fast and inregular at the same time. Only pvc or fast sinus rate. I'm can't sleep I can't enjoy anything and I'm have been a mess last week's because of this Venticular tachardia anxiety. summary. I've experience at least two times fast rate and skipped beats. It also happened one time when I had adrenaline rush because of a bad family fight. My heart started skipping beats alot and sometimes even during dramatic sport events my heart races with skipped beats. It happens if I have adrenaline if I'm excsersising and panic attacks and stress.Also sometimes when drinking alcohol I'm 24 year old 90 kg 185 cm never smoked have panic attacks and health anxiety. Should I worry that they have never capture my heart going fast and skipping beats? Any advice? be honest.I had few good weeks with my anxiety but then googled some shit and found CPVT and it's giving me one helluva anxiety.Im just playing everything in my head. I get more skipped beats when my heart is racing curing excersice or panic.I have had ECG when it happened but my pvc had stopped already and it only showed sinus tachardia.I just want to stop think about this. Deep down I know I'm 99 all right but my brain keeps getting what if especially with cpvt fear. ,Anxiety
51694,Is it anxiety and over thinking? Or is it intuition? How to know the difference? My partner has lied to me in the past and now anything that is remotely close to that topic makes me think hes lying. And then I spiral and think I have to check his phone then I think he deleted messages then I need to check his Apple Watch and then I think he may have used another form of contact and I start to feel like maybe Im being illogical and crossing the line. In the moment I feel like nothing can give me relief except for finding solid proof. Im not proud of this behavior. I recently started therapy for my overall anxiety. Unfortunately it is hard to afford to have sessions often enough. Context He lied 1.5 years ago about something relating to a female coworker it was not infidelity. After lying he was able to prove he was telling the truth. I feel 99 confident about it. Since then he lied about about small things like not playing video games while on the phone. Idk I dont want to damage my relationship with this but I also dont want to be lied to again and turn a blind eye. So how can I know if I am acting because of anxiety and overthinking opposed to following intuition and following my gut. My intuition is how I caught his initial lie.,Anxiety
51840,Does anyone subconsciously hold your breath in while youre doing things like even just laying in bed using your phone? I cant even do simple tasks in peace. Even if Im adjusting to sleep and using my phone in bed my heart feels like its about to explode if I dont take a deep breath in every few seconds because I hold my breath in subconsciously or thats what my body just does to me at least. And then my heart rate gets up and I feel so uneasy and breathless from literally just lying down using my phone. I hate this shit. I cant even yawn properly or take a deep breath in it always gets cut off and Im left feeling like Im about to suffocate.,Anxiety
34414,Swollen lymph nodes for years driving me up the wall. Ugh Hello! I just found this sub and it's so nice to know it isn't just me. This month has been full of health issues and to try to make it a long story short an eating disorder gave me a ton of symptoms that I didn't even consider were from not eating such as really bad nerve pain dizziness lethargy LOTS of weight loss etc. I was POSITIVE the nerve pain positioned right over my left chest was a heart attack and went to the ER at 4am. They did an EKG a blood test urine test a full physical and xray. Everything was aokay aside from malnutrition and general ED signs.I started eating regularly and every symptom went away completely. I feel healthier than I have in a long time go figure. eating helps and I felt reassured and content for about 3 weeks. This all started on the 23rd of last month.But now I have a swollen rock hard lymph node under my chin I've never had before that is sore and a few big but squishy ones on the sides of my neck along with the muscles on the sides of my jaw being sore I grind my teeth possible cause? Something else that is important to note is I had shingles at around age 15 with very swollen and painful lymph nodes and a lot of them never went down. I'm 22 now and can't remember a time when they weren't swollen and occasionally painful but for some reason NOW I'm convinced I have lymph node cancer and can't stop freaking out about it because a new one popped up. I also have yet to gain any weight back but maybe it just hasn't been long enough yet. Panic attacks are becoming a regular occurrence. Has anyone experienced lymph nodes swollen for 7 years? I would have way more symptoms than just pain and swelling if it was cancer right? I just need some reassurance or tips I think. Thank you so much and I hope you all have a good anxiety free night.,Anxiety

52243,trying to cope is killing me too... ive been isolating myself and unintentionally staying sick ulcers and other stomach problems bc its the only way the self hatred and obsessive thoughts that eat up my mind subside and also i forget easily since feeling this weak. this situation has been overextending to the point where idk how bad it is im very swollen and dont digest properly... i have palpitations every day and a very slow heart rate.I just feel very alone and i know its not worth it to keep going like this... but i have no assistance and no one really i know this burden shouldn't be carried by a friend but i wish i were able to give and at least have 1 relationship that works.My family is very strange and manipulative it wasnt until now that ive been realizing a bunch of shit about them.

34756,Pilonidal cyst not responding to anti biotics ugh. I've had this thing for a while but when it flares up its never THAT bad. This time it was pretty painful and didn't go away after 2 days like it usually does. I went to the dermatologist he gave me anti biotics. Its been 2 days with the anti biotics ciprofloxacin and its still inflamed arguably worse than ever. Ibuprofen helps but not enough. Sleeping is so god damn difficult. The dermatologist said that these things can go 'deep' which scared the shit out of me. I've let this thing just sort of stay there for years now and I am terrified that a surgery would basically take a huge chunk of the entire area out just to get rid of this thing. I actually had a surgery for it years ago but that was when it FIRST appeared and that was bad enough. I hate this so fucking much. I can barely sit down but standing hurts too for some reason and so does laying down. ,Anxiety
52661,stress ate and now i feel really poorly. anyone have tips on soothing the aches and nausea? Just in case anyone needs a TW there is talk of medicationand in advance i'm sorry for any spelling errorsampx200Bwasnt feeling well at all and started stress eating. i tried my stratergies that i do with my psychologist but today was just one of those days if you get what i mean.i've eaten too much but a majority of what i've eaten is sugar which also gives me headaches when i eat a lot of it also in case this is needed information i dont get sugar high.idk if i can take nurofen or panadol Panadol is a paracetamol i think and i think nurofe contains ibprofen for the headache because i'm on ritalin methylphenidate and Movox Fluvoxamine i think its called something else in america though and most people on reddit seem to be from the US and idk if some pain killers are compatable with ritalin or movox.im also on a birth control to manage my periods its called Evalyn i think im spelling it right idk the science medication name off the top of my head though but i know i can take pain killers with my BC. however it does cause mild indigestion. i though it'd be good to include this because the intestines and stomach are connected lol. the queasy feeling is really bothering me and i feel sickly. does anyone have any tips on what i can do to ease it? ive drank lots of water both for the stomach ache queasiness and for the headache and have my big water bottle next to me in case i need more but it hasnt helped. just looking at anything food related is making me feel like im gonna throw up too. i've thought of sleeping it off but i struggle to nap during the day and i've already slept in a ton this morning so my body doesnt feel sleepy at all i've tried putting ASMR on too but that isnt making me sleepy.would really appreciate if anyone knows how to help this. i might try looking more into wether i can safely take some pain killers or not using reliable sources so that i can make sure i'll be safei'm also gonna ask on a medical related subreddit if i can take ritalin and movox with pain killers at the same time because it's really hard to find information online on my own.thank you to anyone who reads this and thank you to anyone who can help means a lot to me,Anxiety

34787,Trying to keep cool about my gastrointestinal symptoms Yesterday I woke up with a dry mouth and dry throat. Nothing much. But today I woke up with the same dry mouth as well as the need to fart. When I got home I had some stomach disturbances. It was cramping lightly and it made a lot of noise. I went to the bathroom and found out that I had diarrhea since my poop is very... loose. Went somewhere after a while and then had to go to the bathroom because of my stomach discomfort. Another loose watery poop. As of this post my throat is still dry mouth is okay regardless of the water I drank today. I took PeptoBismol if that helps. Im starting to worry a little bit but a side of me thinks that itll be fine.,Anxiety
34208,HIV worry Hi thereAbout a month ago I had unprotected sex with my ex girlfriend we have still maintained a close friendship. She told me she had been tested for STDs since the last time she had sex I had had blood work and urine work done since the last time I had had sex also. About a week later she told me she had missed her period and we were worried about pregnancy. She was sick for a few days nauseous and fatigued. After a while she got better but during that time I asked if she had blood work done to which she replied no just urine. She thought the same negative thoughts as me she also has health anxiety. When she got better she assured me that she had just been stressed not eating right and I had nothing to worry about. She even called me to reassure me.Now I am studying abroad in the Middle East and I started feeling sick last week. I had a stomach ache normal for new bacteria in food and then a sore throat and congestion. Instantly I thought this was the worst and that I had HIV. Again I told her I was freaking out but she reassured me that I was fine and so was she. I found out that my friend in the program has had the same symptoms as me and we guessed it was allergies.Now Ive been taking antihistamines and feel better but the thought wont leave my mind. I understand that its very hard to get anything through vaginal intercourse plus I am circumcised 0.08 that she has it 0.04 chance that I could get it from her if she was . Its hard to get tested in the country Im in because thats simply how it is. Ive asked her to get tested but she said shes been very busy and she told me I need to get help for my anxiety. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist because I have a history of panicking and anxiety. Should I be worried about this?Thanks and sorry for long read.,Anxiety

Maybe its some random thing but lately this tarot stuff is appearing everywhere on my fyp. I have relationship anxiety and general anxiety too im working on it and i have a bf. The thing is all this tarot readings are since day one i downloaded the app saying that my bf doesnt love me or that he's gonna break up with me. I know its not true but they still manage to put me in a anxious state. Literally a couple of mins ago a video of those appeared and well it gave me a panic attack.I dont know what to do anymore blocking that kind of content is no use and deleting the app isnt a solution too. I've tried it before but those videos start appearing on my instagram and facebook.Does anyone have advice? Please.,Anxiety
34228,What is wrong with me? Ive always been extremely articulate and smart. I operated on a higher consciousness than most people just in the sense that I was more aware of my surroundings and I thought deeply about things. I was also quick witted and being funny was probably my defining personality trait. Until about a week ago I felt like my normal self still a very anxious person regarding my health particularly a brain tumor. Now I just feel like theres been a substantial cognitive decline. I cant think as deeply and Im constantly second guessing myself on if Im using words correctly. I feel Ike my vocabulary is getting worse and I google synonyms for words about 30 times a day. At the same time I also feel more relaxed. It sounds weird but Id rather feel smart and anxious than dumb and relaxed. Im not even particularly happy. I feel like I have no emotions something that has been persisting for a while but now I feel like I have no intelligence something new to me. I am slower to respond in arguments and dont feel as witty as I was two weeks ago. Maybe Im thinking too much about my speech but I just wish I could revert back to normal. Everything just feels so superficial to me. Its weird. I know a symptom of brain tumors is a shift in consciousness. Im messing up when I talk a lot more. I feel like Im forgetting words and not winning in arguments very rare for me. Im only 15 almost 16 and feel like I have Alzheimers or something. On a side site the only other truly concerning symptom I have that could be indicative of something more serious is the smell of smoke occasionally. This isnt a daily occurrence or even a weekly but maybe once or twice a month Ill get a whiff of the faint smell of smoke that is certainly not coming from real life. As of lately I just feel so dumb. I just cant stress the fact that Ive never felt this way before. I hate this feeling. I havent really had emotions for a while this is due to some trauma Ive been through but lack of intelligence is brand new. I may not be completely devoid of my intellect as Im able to express my thoughts coherently in this format but I feel slower than usual. I use to partake in writing creative stories and stuff and I tried to do that yesterday and I struggled and was uncharacteristically out of ideas. Sorry if this sounds repetitive but this has been going on for about a week now and Im not sure whats up. My parents wont let me get an CAT Scan I got an MRI in March 2016 and everything was fine. Is there a possibly a tumor couldve developed in this short of amount of time? Thoughts and opinions please. I just feel like a completely different personAlso sometimes when Id feel really weird or things would get too heavy Id cry and the feelings would subside. Now I cant even cry cause I feel like I dont even have feelings in the first place. I use to be able to explain this perfectly all the time or so it felt like and I took great pride in my ability to articulate things. Now I feel like whenever I do so theres a little voice in my head questioning what I say and if it makes complete sense. I now I sound articulate in my post but I dont feel like I sound like this in real life. Or it at least takes too long for me to express myself. ,Anxiety

35545,2 things Hello! Ive been suffering with anxiety most of my life but got diagnosed officially in college. Anyway I am on Zoloft and am doing well. However there are two things that have been driving me crazy and I was wondering if anyone else gets this. ever since I was little I would try to fall asleep but I would have the urge to urinate. It would frustrate me SO much because it literally made my skin crawl. I would get up and only go a tiny bit. This would happen about 45 times and I finally would calm my body down and fall asleep. Well Im an adult now and this still happens from time to time. Its so annoying and Im not sure why it happens? Its such an urge to go and I cant shake it off until I literally go to the bathroom. Im on birth control and I have bad ice pick needle headaches. Ive kept a headache log and it seems to happen soon before my period. However I am convinced that I have a brain tumor or some type of brain thing thats causing me these HORRIBLE headache pains. Its always the left aide of my head and the pain feels like someone is putting an ice pick in my head real quick then over and over again. It happens minutes from each other and then some time will go by but it will randomly happen again my doctor said I could get an MRI but I dont want to because a Im scared if they do find something and b I am just crazy and nothings wrong with me. Ps. I have a nose ring that I refuse to take out because I did once during surgery and it closed up. Im a 26 year old healthy female.. on birth control Zoloft and have hypothyroidism. On meds as well basically Im just looking if anyone else has these feelings?!! Thanks so much. This community has helped a lot. Even though we all deal with this everyday and its a pain... its nice to know Im not the only one who has to suffer through this. ,Anxiety

34087,Paranoia and Anxiety about that Brain Eating Amoeba Hi everyone. I'm pretty new to this sub but I really need to vent. I was diagnosed with Illness Anxiety Disorder two years ago and I generally have a pretty good hold of it. Yesterday I was showering and a drop or two or water got into one nostril in my nose. I could feel it chilling in my nose hair and I immediately used my towel to wipe it out and then I blew my nose when I got out of the shower. However I live in Florida and I'm really paranoid that the brain eating amoeba is lurking in the water. This was water from the shower head in my dorm and it has been colder lately but I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I'm terrified I'm even tearing up with fear writing this. My birthday is next week and I want to be okay for that and for everything. My mom said I'm worrying needlessly and she's probably right but I can't shake the anxiety.Edit to add It doesn't help that symptoms apparently don't develop for 19 days after infection so I'm going to be sitting in my anxiety for days.,Anxiety

Well ever since that started happening I've like been sent over the edge and am almost constantly worrying that I have a myriad of neurological diseases from a stroke to retinal detachment to a brain tumor. I've also been having stomach pains like nausea for the past few days but I'm not sure if im making up phantom nausea because I'm worried I have a brain tumor. I also have had some on and off mild headaches but like I said above I could just be imagining it into existence. I went in yesterday for a full eye exam and the optomologist said my eyes retina and all are in perfect condition.

35382,I feel worse and worse by the day. Intense brain fog feeling weak chest heart? pain very fatigued and I have really bad circulation problems. Doctors dont take me seriously. And I feel like maybe its all in my head but yet I feel like my body is screaming its not in your head Ive felt not well for years. Ive gone to the doctor and they usually take one look at me and say I look young and healthy and its all good. Theyve never done any kind of tests on me unless I argued it. I got an ECG last year for my heart and it was normal. But I have had pain in my heart area for over a year now and its progressively worse. The last few months I have major brain fog headaches I feel extremely weak and my muscles in my chest and back have these weird.... things. They feel loose or.. I dont know. They just hurt really badly sometimes. It feels like needles pulling them apart and its weird.I just feel very unwell and every time I go to the doctor I feel Like they think Im a hypochondriac.

35555,Am I Going Crazy? So Im a healthy 27 year old American woman today is my birthday and the last few months have been almost unbearable and I cant seem to get a grip on anything. For reference it all started last November when I started having pain in my upper left abdomen that wouldnt seem to go away. Im currently living in Spain which is where Im currently living and working. My doctor said that I had acid reflux and told me to what I ate. Pain persisted lots of mucus coming out constipation tons of gas. Decided to take a probiotic and managed to get my symptoms to disappear for a month while on winter break. Then in January the pain came back. My stools were hard and dark and the pain was consistent. Had an ultrasound and was told that I had tons of gas in my colon so they couldnt see clearly but my other organs looked good. But then my coworker suddenly began having blood in her stool too and many intestine issues. Turns out that she had worms. I decided to check my stool found something that looked like a worm went to the emergency room tool mebendazol to get rid of the worms This also made sense because I lived in Asia for 2 years before Spain and had just recently moved.Just after my first dose of mebendazole I started to have a weird feeling in my lungs. Felt like I couldnt breathe in all the way but that was it. Anyway in addition to that I began to have sinus pressure a mild sore throat and drainage. I took my second dose of the worm medicine had a stool sample that came back clear of everything no blood and even a chest Xray that was clear. Ive been secretly worried that I have colon cancer since a friend of mine suddenly died at age 25 from it. She had no symptoms and went to the doctor with a persistent cough and ended up having stage 4. Since my lung issues flared up Ive been so worried that I have some cancer that has metastasized and went to my lungs. I havent been able to completely shake this cold yet and its been over 3 or 4 weeks. I still wake up and spit up yellowish colored spit. Lungs feel a bit off. To make matters worse Im still having stomach problems after being cleared of the worms and my doctor says that I probably have IBS. Then last night I began having heart palpitations and rushed to the emergency room. My EKG was normal and my blood test was normal. She said I have pvcs and need to relax. Honestly I just feel like Im shutting down and I havent felt healthy in a long time. I cant seem to shake this chest cold my digestive problems are still there have some reflux too and now pvcs.

51743,My anxiety makes me feeling like im dying everyday and its ruining my life. I dont want to die but dont know what to do. I barely get enough sleep i feel on edge constantly like im gonna have another episode. My breathing has been an issue for days now and i keep having ticks and making humming noises occasionally and when i breathe out. I cant focus properly on anything or distract myself. The physical feeling are so intense I genuinely feel like im dying and cant stop it. I cant stop doing heavy breathing occasionally and my throat feels so strange like ive had globus sensation before but this feeling is like tenfold i get a sickly tingling sensation in my stomach and chest and not to mention that its so hard to physically talk eat and drink when i really want to. Any tiny little thing can trigger me an then i spend hoursdays having an attack that leaves me tired and unable to sleep. I take 20mg citalopram every morning an it doesnt seem to be working. Any advice woould be amazing since im up to try anything at this point. I just want the pain to go away.,Anxiety
51828,psychiatrist wont do anything i went to the psychiatrist yesterday which id been looking forward to bc my anxiety has been so bad lately that the second i get out of school im already anxious to go back the next day or all weekend im anxious. and when im at school im feeling the most gut wrenching anxiety ive felt in my entire life. also i throw up when im anxious. so every day i throw up usually at school. teachers are sick of me missing and needing to sit somewhere to relax. i told my psychiatrist who acts confused every time she sees me and ive only seen her treat 5 year olds that i will die if i do not start feeling better. because it has led me to feeling pretty hopeless and it often is so bad that it does feel like im dying. she just increased the amount of my medicine im already on thats obviously not working for the 279037th time even though i told her i wanted to try something else or get something fast acting. she just said she wouldnt give me anything fast acting because im young. im so tired of living like this. what can i do? im in therapy 10 hours a week for this and other reasons but i need something to hold me up until i can get through the day completely on what im learning in therapy.,Anxiety
34908,Feeling of trapped burpexcessive burpingNausea Hello all lately Ive been going through a scare as someone with IBS. Lately Ive been excessively burping. Even if I havent eaten anything yet and especially once I eat something. However the thing is sometimes I need to force the burp out because it feels like its trapped in my stomach or chest or throat. And when Im unable to get the burp out it makes me feel nauseous. For the past couple of days except yesterday Ive been either dry heaving or actually vomiting. When I vomit its either this clear liquid that tastes like acid which I assume is acid and sometimes its food I eat. Burping helps relieve the feeling for a few minutes but then its back. This has been happening for a couple of weeks already. But before I wasnt diagnosed with IBS. I had HA about colon cancer. Once I was told that it was IBS by my GI the burping never stopped but the nausea sort of did.Fast forward a little bit and I was fine. I was eating healthier and my bowel movements were even improving. I even went on a trip to Hawaii and I was fine there. I had one bout of nausea but thats it. And then shit hit the fan right when I got back from Hawaii. Basically whatever I said in the beginning lol. But heres a list of all my symptomsmedical issuesExcessive burpingfeeling like a burp is trapped in stomachchestthroatNausea due to reason aboveOccasional acid when I burp and in the morning when I wake up making me think its possibly GERD but I dont have heartburn and this feeling is only occasionaldry heavingvomiting clear liquidfood. No red blood or coffee grounds or green or yellow liquid.mild IBS no abdominal pain predominantly constipation although it has been getting better. Ive been having nice BM every day. But yesterday it was diarrhea which is weirdsometimes blood on the toilet paper but this always happens when I have to strain and it hurts and itches. GI says I have internal hemorrhoids.BM are usually 45 on the Bristol stool chartSwollen turbinate and a deviated septum ah my first bout of my HA. If I could go back in time I would prevent this lol.Fatiguesome skin patches that idk if its eczema or psoriasis. Leaning towards eczema since I have an intense family history of it.Ive had no weight loss thankfully. I actually gained weight in Hawaii haha. So its basically the burping nausea that is making my HA spike. And it sucks because it makes me anxious that I have some deadly colonstomach disease again and Ive considered making an appointment with my GI to see if I can get an endoscopycolonoscopy which he was very reluctant to do since Im 22 years old. This burping and nausea is just so annoying and depressing. I had to go home from work because of it. Ive been combating the vomiting well so far. Breathing sort of helps with nausea as well as chewing gum and ginger ale. However they havent been as effective as before. My mind is going through so many possibilities of what this could be hiatal hernia GERD postnasal drip from my nose problems a general IBS flare up a stomach ulcer my stupid anxiety or something worse. Its just so fucking scary. The only thing that makes me feel better is sleep. Please the best advice andor reassurance.,Anxiety
52039,Would all this be caused by anxiety? Hello everyone I'm a 20 year old Caucasian male. 59 155lbs. I don't smoke i don't drink alcohol nor use any drugs. So it's been almost 1.5 years that I've developed some strange symptoms that have really deteriorated my life.They basically started after i caught covid i was vaccined prior with the jampj vaccine. Since then i get heart pains all the time. They happen multiple times a day and usually last a few minutes before they go away. I've been to 2 different cardiologists who ran an EKG and echo and said that everything was fine. I also had a 48 hour Holter monitor that showed some pvc's 200a daybut docs weren't concerned at all. Also after covid my WBC are basically running around the 1113k range before that CBC's would come back fine. They were fine before i got infected but it's been almost 1.5 year that they won't go down. My lymphocytes are also high 4550 and neutrophils low 3540. Everything else comes back completely fine. I went to a hematologist and he run some tests for malignanciesleukemia but they came back negative. One of the worst symptoms also is the spasms I've been getting all over my body. They can happen literally anywhere and they always last a few seconds before they go away. I've searched a lot about them and i guess it's most likely BFS benign fasciculation syndrome. But it never stops. I think my nerve system has been permanently damaged. Lastly i get random aches in my stomach and usually at the upper left abdominal region. I've had an abdominal echo and it was fine. But i get random shooting pains along with painful gasses. These are the symptoms I've been dealing with the past 1.5 year. They're all so random and I can't connect them somehow. High WBC usually mean infection so I'm guessing that an autoimmune disease might have been triggered?I've also found a lump in my arm. It's been there for 1.5 year as well i showed it to my gp and he said that it's a lipoma but it's still there. It hasn't grown but it hurts sometimes. Things like sarcoma drive my mind crazy. It feels like my body is constantly trying to kill me. The whole thing is causing me so much anxiety and stress. I thought that things would get better with time but no nothing has changed and it's been so long. I'm only 20 years old and I'm afraid that I'm gonna drop dead by a heart attack or cancer. I used to be an athlete but i stopped after all these because i became afraid. I honestly can't live like this anymore. I've visited more than 5 doctors and nobody has a clue. Any ideas?,Anxiety
35517,Im having bad anxiety about HIV and its cause me to be super depressed even though I keep telling myself I shouldnt worry. So this is kind of a rant because Im sitting in my car outside work trying to find the strength to go in...this anxiety has just been CONSUMING me for the last two weeks and I feel like its at its worst today.Im not sure why Im so worried about it but for the last two weeks Ive been SUPER worried about having HIV. Two weeks ago I found a cyst behind my ear and went to the doctors thinking it was a swollen lymph node. He told me it was a cyst and sent me home with a cream its basically gone by now.But Im still convinced I have HIV. I know the best solution is to get tested but I work so much that I wont be able to make that happen until next week.Ive had allergies and eczema my entire life so while the seasons are changing here theyve been going crazy. Now I have a swollen lymph node in my neck.Ive never had any of the symptoms of HIV flu like symptoms lasting weeks a rash vomiting amp diarrhea etc. But something in my brain is just TELLING me I have it. Im a gay man and for the last few years Ive been really safe with sex. My main fear is two people I slept with back in 2013. One of those guys was tested in 2017 when I was seeing him again and he came back clean. Ive slept with a total of one other person in the last two years because we were dating for the majority of it and he was clean as well. But I am still convincing myself I have it. Im not sure if this anxiety could cause my lymph node in my neck to swell because its swollen But this is only fueling my anxiety.Im freaking out and more depressed than Ive been in years. Would I have seen genuine symptoms by now if I had contracted it?,Anxiety

35542,Thyroid cancer? Lymphoma? Random infection? I'm a 21 year old male. 20 days ago I started feeling pain in the lower right part of my throat right above my collarbone. Halfway through the week I noticed a lump was there and made an appointment with my doctor. Doctor sent me for an ultrasound and found a 3cm lump in my neck but couldn't make out what exactly it was so I was sent for a CT scan. The CT scan results showed that this tumor was near a muscle and lymph node. It looked suspicious to her and she also saw 2 other minor swollen lymph nodes so she referred me to a much better hospital Vanderbilt so that they could do their own tests. That was 12 days ago. This past Friday I had a fine needle biopsy done on the lump and got the results back yesterday. Apparently cancer wasn't detected and bacteria wasn't either but I did see something about 2 polys. The test was essentially inconclusive but whatever it was it looked infectious and something on the uncommon side according to my doctor. My doctor was going to prescribe me Augmentin but since I am allergic I was prescribed Clindamycin. He wants to try me on that for a week and see if it helps. However the day after the biopsy was done I have started experiencing slight pain right under my adam's apple when I yawn or look down. Seems like there is a bump there too. I let my doctor know this yesterday but he still wants to go through with the antibiotic for a week to see if anything changes. I don't really notice any other symptoms. I think my mouth has been a bit more dry as of late but nothing crazy. I was pretty worried early on but started to get over it until this other lump showed up. Wouldn't the CT scan from just over a week ago detected this new lump? I feel like I should be relieved that they didn't find anything malignant but I'm also worried that maybe they missed it or didn't get a proper reading. I have all the trust in the world in this hospital but my nerves are getting the best of me. Sorry if this is kind of all over the place. ,Anxiety

I also have been hearing blood rushing and ringing in my right ear especially when its quiet and im leaning or bending over.

I also wheeze sometimes when I exhale and feel mucus in my chest when i laugh ,Anxiety
34097,Constantly checking for signs of brain problem Hey guys. So this is a little difficult to explain so hopefully I can describe it as cohesively as possible. So a couple months ago I developed a little obsession with misreading things. I misread a couple of words and immediately began to think there is something wrong with my brain. Well now its manifested itself in just about everything. In a bizarre way to prove I dodont have a problem Ive begun subconsciously checking every thing I read and hear to see if I made a mistake. For instance Ill skim a headline really fast online then get frustrated when I misread it even though I didnt carefully read it. Because Im now checking every single word I read and hear Im constantly misreading mishearing and misunderstanding things because Im focusing on each individual word and not the sentence as a whole. Its mentally exhausting and is effecting my reasoning skills and memory which of course is fueling my health anxiety as it further proves I have something wrong with me. Of course occupying my mind with this causes me to make many many mistakes which you guessed it fuels it more. Has anyone else struggled with health anxiety pertaining to a brain problem? This really sucks. ,Anxiety

34604,Today I had THE worst panic attack of my life Ok so just got home from hospital after having a major panic attack.My HA started 6 years ago when I fell ill had a number of tests on my head and heart over the course of a few weeks. During this time I convinced myself I was dying too many different ailments to list.I started having panic attacks usually when in a crowded area that were debilitating.Cue lots of therapy medication and 6 years later I felt I had it under control I still have bad days and symptoms but not as bad as previous. I haven't had a proper panic attack for a couple of years.Then today. I've had a cold for a few days and had taken my daughters to their dancing competition when suddenly I started to feel dizzy. This quickly became a cold rush through my body and tunnel vision. Heart rate doubled blood pressure rose and I was expecting to pass out.I have friends at this competition and I asked them to call an ambulance. Trip to aampe 2 ecg's later and given the all clear I'm now resting at home heart rate slowly coming down and the cold rushes are getting further apart and I'm mentally drained.Does anyone else get lasting effects from an attack?

35190,Scared of heart pumping problem My mom developed cardiomyopathy inadequate pumping due to weakening of the heart muscle when I was 8 or 9 I'm 21 now. Since then she's been on medicines and her condition has improved significantly in last 12 years. A few years ago I started having heart palpitations which were more noticeable after I did some exercise. I was af and my parents took me to the ER but they said it's just anxiety but as my mom has this condition I should get it checked out. We went to the cardiologist the next day who ran some tests like ECG Echo and bloodwork and everything came out normal. After a few months I stopped noticing the symptoms even while exercising. I still get palpitations when I'm going through a phase of anxiety but rarely otherwise. Out of curiosity I surfed the internet about cardiomyopathy and came to know that a person has 50 chance of inheriting the faulty gene from their affected parent and I'm really scared now. The articles even mentioned that in some cases the first diagnosis comes to light when a family member dies suddenly due to cardiac arrest. I'm really scared now of developing this disease now or in the near future and I don't really know what I can do about it. I want to mention one more thing that my mom's heart pumping has come back to normal but she still takes the medicine because a condition is a condition so the prognosis is good in her case. ,Anxiety

34158,Scared about temporal arteritis Adding to all the cancers and heart conditions I've been worried about I just read about temporal arteritis and I'm worried about it too. I'm a 23 year old white male. For the past couple days I've had tenderness near my right temple only. There's no constant pain but it hurts when I put mild to moderate pressure on a certain part of the bone behindunder the temple. I can feel a slight bump there but there's an essentially symmetrical one on the other side with no tenderness with the same amount of pressure. I do have many other symptoms of temporal arteritis including frequent headaches although generally mild tiredness in limbs and general tiredness but I've had all that for a long time and often can be traced to specific causes like poor sleeping habits and dehydration. I don't have any of the jaw pain or tiredness any more so than I would normally get after chewing for a long time anyway although sometimes my mouth does feel slightly stiff if I haven't opened it for a while. I do have a bad habit of clenchinggrinding my teeth that I've had for most of my life and I've had TMJassociated pain before. I don't think I've had any vision loss but sometimes I do find it harder to focus or I feel like I'm not seeing quite as well when I' tired so I can't say for sure. I don't have any other tender points on my scalp just the right temple.,Anxiety

35616,In need of some advicesupport Hey all! First I want to say thank you to everyone in this sub. Ive been quietly reading your posts for months now and it is truly the reason I dont feel so alone anymore. Ive been dealing with health anxiety since I was 12. I saw a poster in the nurses office at school which explained the symptoms of menengitis and spent almost a year touching my chin to my neck to make sure I was okay. Then it turned into having anxiety about HIVAIDS and lymphoma. My anxiety was so bad I had to drop out of my dream college because I couldnt handle it. I felt happy for years after that. I focused on other things. But this January something changed. I suddenly began feeling everything I used to before. Constantly worried about various diseases even after being reassured that I was okay. Its straining my relationships with my family my boyfriend and my friends. My constant reassurance seeking is making everyone lose their patience with me. I feel like I cant handle it anymore. I sleep most of the day because thats the only time when the terrible thoughts dont come. The worst part is this feeling I like to call happy...but. It occurs in situations where I feel happy but cannot truly experience the moment for what it is because Im worried. Im happy...but I could have a disease Im happy... but it will only be for a little while until the anxiety comes back. Anyone else feel this way? ,Anxiety
35423,How many of you have been triggered by lymph nodes? So I have lived most of my life with anxiety always taking new faces. On december my uncle died of ALS and shit was rough part because he was an amazing uncle and part because that illness is awful. Ever since then I have been suffering health anxiety and just now I am realizing that's what I am feeling. In this time I have been convinced that I have ALS because fuck yeah I do have all the symptoms. I have a tumor on my head my long time sinuses problems are caused by it also as any other new gen kid my sight has develop some wear and my right eye has astigmatism and myopia which is normal. Last but not least I have been touching my lymph nodes for fucking 2 months and they don't go away which my ENT already said was a normal stuff for me. Just now I realized maybe lymph nodes are never that small that if you push hard on your skin they won't be felt it's said a lymph node with a 1 cm diameter is normal. So I have been probably just pushing real hard on my neck that I always find them swollen.,Anxiety
35730,Just so scary. So Ive had health anxiety for most of my life. Like over 30 years. I am a nurse. It was easy to go into healthcare because Id spent so much of my life researching different diseases I was sure I had or thought I had a good chance of getting or someone I knew I had. I used to really obsessively research stuff it somehow made me feel better. Anyway. Now Im a nurse. I just finished a 4 day stretch of shifts 14 hours a day no time for meal breaks or any rest at all during work and I only had time to sleep about 6 hours between shifts. So I know rationally that my body and mind are exhausted and that exacerbates the health anxiety. But I woke this morning and every single muscle in my legs and back hurt so bad I can hardly walk. My hands are clammy and cold and sweaty this never happens. I keep swinging between feeling really hot and then getting really chilled. I also have severe emetophobia and Im terrified Im coming down with something. My tummy feels weird like I need to poop but I cant. I cant stand the thought of food. My throat hurts. And all of this is setting off major panic attacks so bad I feel like I cant leave my house. I have a therapy appt in an hour and I really really need to go grocery shopping. Please help. Do you think Im sick? Thanks. ,Anxiety
34473,Drove downwind of a confirmed asbestos fire today. freaking the hell out so yeah there was a major fire in the city today. we had no idea till we were driving up on it. The route I wanted to take was blocked due to the fire. At that time we had no idea the smoke was highly toxic. So cause our route was blocked I took a street pretty much parellel to the one we were supposed to take. We drive and we come across smoke and drive right through it. I also played the funny guy and breathed in really hard and said mmmm smell that to be funny.Read on the news when we got home the building contained asbestos and theres an asbestos warning for the whole city center. So yeah now here we are. I'm in a really really bad place now.That said there are a few things which I guess are kinda making me feel a bit better. We were about 800 feet maybe from the burning building in question and we drove through about 8 hours after the fire started and apparently it had been contained by that point.Still we walked around the city center all day and drove through it and waited at a stop light in the smoke. My lungs feel full and I think my nose burns a little though that could be becuase later on at the bar I stood with my frie ds a few times while they all smoked cigarettes.And this is kinda gross but I could have sworn my farts had a kind of asphalt like smell which I got when I quit smoking which indicates smoke inhalation of some kind. I guess I could be misidentiying it though.I dunno... I'm just really scared now.,Anxiety

35828,Severe Hypochondria after Being on Accutane Hey everyone. Most of my life I have never thought twice about a physical symptom and was confident in my health. However that changed when I went on Accutane to help my cystic acne in August 2018. I started experiencing physical symptoms such as an increased resting heart rate all the time around 100 or more bpm when it used to be around 75 stomach issues like indigestion and weird bubblinggurgling coming up my throat and noises in my stomach when I sucked it in and out which I later researched and believe is succussion splash. I was feeling very anxious about how my body was feeling and felt like I was changing like I wasn't the same person. I know Accutane is associated with horror stories so that just fueled my anxiety. I stopped the medicine at only 2.5 months instead of completing the full course which was supposed to be 6 months. I was so concerned about my symptoms that I went to three doctors got an EKG echocardiogram different blood tests and capsule endoscopy. Doctors said everything was normal. Cardiologist agrees that my pulse was a little higher than normal but still in the normal range and that it's nothing to be worried about diagnosed it as inappropriate sinus tachycardia I haven't been able to do things normally since then. I have had better days where I forget my symptoms but it has been bad lately. I went on a trip recently with my mother and I was incredibly anxious the entire time because my symptoms were heightened. I never had trouble with trips so the fact that I am unable to handle things the way I used to is very concerning. I haven't been able to eat normally as I feel nauseous often and have lost weight without trying. I have also felt dizzy and numb? Half of me is saying there is something is terribly wrong with me and that I need to get more tests done and second and third opinions and the other half is saying that my anxiety is what is actually causing the symptoms. It's a vicious cycle. I never used to be this way. It started when I took that medication and my mind is telling me that I will never be the same because of 2.5 months on an acne drug. Meanwhile doctors told me that I am 100 healthy. Please give me advice on what I should do.,Anxiety
35760,Dizziness pressure in head headaches strange seizurelike episodes brain tumor or sinus infection? Hey all. I'm making a doctor's appointment first thing in the moring but I'd like some advice on what I am experiencing in the meantime. For a couple months I have been getting these strange episodes that I can only describe as pseudoseizures. One of the most notable symptoms is that I suddenly have this overwhelming sensation of physical buildup like you get right before a good sneeze or before you start crying. However that release doesn't come so I get urges to make noise like moaning or screaming to force the feeling out. Another big symptom is a sudden inability or difficulty in swallowing. It's like I've forgotten how to move my tongue properly or like my mouth is too dry and I can only partially swallow. I have to push food to the back of my throat so that it's already partially down and then struggle to get it the rest of the way. I stop eating when this happens because I don't want to risk choking. Other symptoms are a tightness in the back of my head confusion and sometimes waves of tingles or energy washing over my scalp. The waves are very brief but will repeat over and over for up to 20 minutes. When they stop the rest of the symptoms go away too. I havent gotten too many of these the past couple weeks but they were nearly constant a month ago.For the past couple weeks I have been having sporadic dizzy spells that feel like my body is floating or like my brain is swimming around in my head. Sometimes I get queasy during these spells. I noticed that they seemed to come or be worsened when looking at screens like my phone or computer so I eventually figured it must be cybersickness. I am using my devices less and more carefully and the dizzy spells got better for a few days.However now I am having very uncomfortable pressure in my head that seems to move around. It is mainly in my temples and the back of my head but sometimes I can feel it in my nose too. It ranges from being annoying to feeling like my head has been put in a gentle hydraulic press. I feel dizzy when the pressure worsens.Every so often my right hand will feel slightly numb and it feels like I've lost some fine motor control in it. However it's hard to tell if that is real or is just anxiety. It could also be carpal tunnel because I am an artist and it's in the hand I use to do most everything. It usually goes away in a few minutes to an hour.I have been dealing with issues with my eyeglass prescription for the past few months. My old prescription had run its course and had started giving me trouble so I went and got a new one a few weeks ago but it's too strong so I'm getting them bumped down a bit now.Here are my crazy concerns brain tumor adultonset hydrocephalus brain cancer cancer is of least concern because I recently had bloodwork and it came back perfect so I shouldn't have thatMy more realisic theories are sinus issues like infection or irritation anxiety eye strain from not wearing my glasses and having an outdatedoverpowered prescription.I was getting my prescription rewritten today and my eye doctor looked at my eyes to see if he could find any sign of a tumor and he said everything looked good to him but I'm still worried.What are all your thoughts? Do you think those strange episodes are really seizures? Should I be worried I have a tumor?,Anxiety
35641,I am doing much better! Hey guys had an awful panic attack that sent me to the ER back in August and started a whole slew of anxiety related problems and oh boy I don't wish this upon anyone. So I have had pretty much every symptom under the sun from anxiety and SSRI medication. I could barely function work study I couldn't leave the house. Then the health anxiety started up and I wa sure I was dying all the time. Pain would be all over the place and move around and change the type of pain. All just anxiety. Life was brutal. But since we rarely see posts on this. I AM DOING WAY BETTER!!! I feel like my normal self and honestly feel like i am a better person I am much more compassionate sympathetic and understanding because of my experiences. And for everyone battling anxiety I know it can feel hopeless but you can get better. Take things one day at a time. Just try to do 1 thing better everyday. ,Anxiety
34716,I told myself that 2019 was going to be the year I beat this two days in Ive failed I discovered a small spot on my abdomen to the right of my belly button that is a little bit sore when I bend over or move a certain way. Ive poked and prodded at it so much trying to feel around for any abnormalities such as a lump that now it hurts more from all the poking. Im not exactly sure what it is that Im afraid I have this time since Im trying so hard not to google anything and besides appendicitis I am not sure what other malicious causes could explain this sort of abdominal pain. My mom says its probably a muscle strain. I do not feel anything abnormal when I press however I carry some extra weight in my belly so I fear that I just cannot feel anything through the layer of fat. Not a great start to 2019 at all. ,Anxiety

52622,Am I being too hard on myself? I'm putting myself through a university undergraduate degree as a mature student 25 and I just had my grades improve over the last two semesters. But this semester... My father in law had emergency surgery in January. I got approved for breast reduction surgery in February and had it done March 21st this past Tuesday and now I have to drop 1 course out of 3 because I'm failing it and can't keep up it's an elective that's not in my field of study.I think the stress of that course will jeprodize my recovery but my stress isn't gone. Due to my Fs in that course I'm second guessing myself. I have an interview this coming Tuesday to be a research assistant and have to submit a writing sample and I feel inadequate. Even though I get really high marks on my papers in my field. I feel like I'm not allowed to be proud of myself. To be optimistic or excited. I feel like I have to be hard on myself instead of encouraging. I sound delusional asking if I'm being too hard on myself because I know the answer... But I can't let myself believe it.,Anxiety
51737,The Rollercoaster ride of anxiety. Starts off slow maybe you don't notice then eventually starts going up and no matter how hard I try to meditate mindfulness and it slowly goes up until it peaks and I crash down. Then I'm okay for a day a week and start climbing again.

34944,Eyelids twitching for many months? Just wondering how many people here have had their eyelids twitching for many months or longer? If you finally got it to go away what did you do?I see a lot of posts where people are stressing about eyelids twitches theyve had for days or weeks or sometimes hours. But mine have twitched to varying degrees since last May or so. I have tried several bouts of destressing improving my sleep meditating exercising eating bananas drinking tonic water taking multivitamins ... but cant seem to get them to stop twitching.I also notice if I blink hard sneeze look certain directions etc that theyll start twitching. If I partially close my eyes then the muscles around my eyes quiver like theyre straining to hold the position. Which leads me down the path of thinking its more than stress anxiety and something more in my muscles or nervous system. Especially since it has lasted this long through many periods of low stress.Any advice from people who have beaten this? I cant even remember what it was like to go a whole day without twitching! ,Anxiety
34376,Need some support this week! Hi friends! Long time reader first time poster. I've suffered from health anxiety for a few years now and I'm currently going through one of my worst bouts yet.I'm getting a colonoscopy later this week because of some gastrointestinal issues I'm in my 20s and my doctor has assured me multiple times he is not expecting colorectal cancer based on my symptoms. However it's all I can think about. I can't stop Googling my symptoms finding people younger than me who were diagnosed with cancer finding people with less symptoms than me finding out they had cancer etc.Just looking for any advice to get through the next few days. Sending so much love to everyone who has to live like this. ,Anxiety

34967,No relief... It's pretty frustrating but knowing my anxiety is causing me a lot of these worrying physical sensations it doesn't make them go away. I'm well aware that I'm struggling with health anxiety and when things flare up I tell myself over and over that it's a mental problem but I still don't get much relief.I take painkillers almost every day for various aches and pains I try sipping water when my throat feels tight. I know I don't get enough exercise it can exacerbate feeling shaky and lightheaded and I probably don't eat right either. I get low moods and feel unmotivated a lot of the time.Any tips on how to self help? What small things work for other people? ,Anxiety
34747,terrified of being pregnant hiiii'm 19 and on birth control but sometimes i'm bad at taking it on time because of the hours that i work. in september i had sex without a condom but he didn't finish in me and we didn't even have sex for very long so i know there's a low chance of pregnancy already. i've had light periods every month since then which isn't unusual for me but i've also had pregnancy symptoms like backpain moodiness and headaches that my doctor said is just stress from school and work. i've taken 3 pregnancy tests and they've all been negative but i can't shake the feeling that i'm pregnant because i read so much about women who didn't know they were pregnant until later onlabor or women that had light monthly bleeding throughout their pregnancy. i know that i'm overreacting but i just keep analyzing my body way too much and thinking about every random pain or symptom i get. does anyone have advice for making this anxiety go away? i've stopped googling my symptoms because every search brings me to babycenter forums but i can't stop thinking about it thank you sm ,Anxiety

Every time I wake up in the middle of the night it feels like I'm in a nightmare where a world exists that little kids and children are randomly dying of the flu. It breaks me heart and of course since i have this bad sore throat and coughs I'm convinced I have pneumonia now. Does anyone else have this problem of taking what other people have and making it yours? It'd just scare to think since everyone gets the flu so it'd not like it's rare or anything that's the scariest part.

35162,I think I am a textbook case of health anxiety. So this all starts about 5 weeks ago. I had strange discomfort in my side's and went to the gp when they didn't seem to get better. She ordered a full blood work and also gave me a physical examination. Bloods came back completely fine with only a slightly elevated pancreas enzyme base is 100 mine was 107 and for some unknown reason to myself and to the doctor I convinced myself I had pancreatic cancer. Ever since the discomfort has shifted from my side's to the top of my abdomen and I obsess over every little niggle I feel. I'm constantly poking at my glands in my neck 5 years ago i also convinced myself I had lymphoma and now I'm checking every little thing my body does. They gave me CA19.9 blood test used to detect tumour growth in pancreatic cancer cases and mine was 6.1 normal health person is between 135 so that should have made me feel better it didn't. They then sent for an ultrasound which showed everything looks exactly like it should. I've literally heard from 6 doctors now mostly at the accident and emergency department they are 99.9 I don't have pancreatic cancer and that I probably have gastritis. So I'm getting a camera down my throat next month to test for that. No matter how many times they said I was ok I just keep thinking they're wrong. Something is wrong. I know my body and this doesn't feel right. I did loose some weight and my appetite went away but has since come back. So how they're throwing all these anti anxiety drugs my way Diazapam 10mg Propanalol 10mgOlanzapine 20mg 10mg and 5mg depending how bad I feel at the time I'm not having restful sleeps constantly struggling to distract myself. I just want some advice. The kind of advice from someone who's been through this rabbit hole.... I just don't know what to do... I'm sorry if the post makes little sense I'm writing it on my phone and I'm not the most educated person in the world.I should also note I've been suffering from social anxiety since I was 10. Thank you for your time.,Anxiety

35625,IM 23F FREAKING THE FUCK OUT All last week was getting headaches and I never get headaches or have allergies Friday and Saturday when sitting down for a while and would stand up my head would feel very heavy got dizzy and dull pain enough to make we wince.Monday morning woke up sucking from my throat a decent amount of blood mixed with my mucus. Constantly since Monday morning sucking up either bright red blood streaked all through mucus or just straight up like dime to penny sized black blood clots in mucus. Seriously every couple of minutes sucking it up. Occasionally will stop for 30 minutes or so but always starts up againHavent been sick or coughing or had nose bleedsWent to doctor on Tuesday they sent me for blood work which still isnt ready referred me to and ENT. Saw them today they put a scope down up my nose and down my throat didnt see anything ordered an XRay of chest and MRI of my brain. Xray wont be ready for 2448 hours and MRI people arent even calling me schedule until Monday. Going on four fucking days of spitting up dime to penny sized blood clots and Im just sitting around here probably fucking dying while I wait on all these tests. Did ease up a bit today just smaller bits of bright red and dark black blood throughout the day towards end of day started to turn more brown than red or black and I started to feel better until I just spit up a huge black clot.

34072,Hip still swollen 4 months after fall anxiety about it hangs over me. About months ago I fell and landed on my hip. I stayed down for a minute or two only because I didn't think it would be a good idea to get up immediately but then I got up and was fine. It was sore that night but that was about it. The swelling started that night too. Maybe a week and a half later I went to the doctor about it. He didn't do any xrays but he felt around and tested my range of motion. My range of motion was fine and I didn't have any pain and he said everything felt like normal swelling. He said it looked like the normal response to a fall and that swelling can take 5 weeks to heal I think. So here I am 17 weeks later and my hip is still swollen. There was a moment where it hurt for a bit about 2 months ago but that was only for a week or two. The anxiety about it hangs over me. It's always there as something that actually shouldn't be happening something that to me is not easily explainable.,Anxiety

34566,Cant get over this fear... Health anxiety is the worst. I dont know how to get over it. Every time Im over one health fear a new one shows up. Currently Im terrified I have a pulmonary embolism that my drs are missing. Ive been short of breath for a month now. I went to the ER and they did a CT with contrast and an XRay and said there was no PE especially since my blood ox was 100 and my BP was perfect. I accepted this for a little bit but now I fear they just missed it. My GP said its my asthma and allergies but since my inhalers arent working Im back to thinking a PE. I got dizzy recently so I called 911. They said blood ox was good and EKG was good and agreed it was my asthmaanxiety. The EMT said they can miss PEs on CTs though so Ive been spiraling since last Thursday. Im so scared this thing is missed and Im just going to drop dead. I cant talk to my husband about it because the subject just enrages him at this point. Im sitting here debating on going to the ER again for another CT but I also know thats crazy. Anyone else struggle with this fear?,Anxiety
35366,my neck is constantly cracking! so my neck has been constantly cracking for a long time now but now its even more frequent than it used to be. i can also MOVE bits and pieces in the back of my neck which feels like small pieces of bone. i saw a doctor for this she basically diagnosed me as overly anxious about my health that it is all a mental thing. i agree in this because i AM always anxious about my health.when my neck cracks which is with many movements not just occasionally but VERY frequently i dont really feel any pain but it does worry me a lot.my neck cracking gets worse when i am in certain positions or if i sit down on a chair for a long time.sometimes with the pains i feel like sharp stabbing pains occasionally in my head or wherever it may be i am starting to feel overly anxious about them because i wonder if it could be because of my neck.im only 17 but i have very bad posture and a sedentary lifestyle for many years now.i am mostly concerned about the bits and pieces that i can shift in the back of my neck they feel like tiny pieces of bone and i can move them around. everyone ive asked about this does not relate to what im saying at all! i also get headaches nearly every day i have a bit of scoliosis and tmj so i wonder if this is related at all.i just dont feel like this is normal and its really making me anxious lately so if anyone else experiences constant cracking and crunching in their neck tell me! and are you able to move little pieces that feel like bone in the back of your neck? if anyone can help me alleviate this anxiety i will be extremely grateful!,Anxiety

52684,Advice greatly needed 26 year old female sorry for the long post Ive been on anti depressants for about the last 12 years of my life. I was always on 100 mg zoloft amp then switched to 20 mg lexapro in 2018 but went off of them for about 6 months in 2021 to try to live without them. At the end of those 6 months I started to get dizzy more often amp have what I can only describe as uncontrollable thoughts. Not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone but I just did not feel in control of my emotions and I felt like I was gonna lose my mind lol amp very depressed. So I got back on lexapro 20 mg amp after a few months I started to feel average at best but better than before. August 2022 I started to get brain zapsdizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start. I worked my way up to 75mg amp started to feel a lottttt better but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since. Very dizzy lots of anxiety amp panic attacks and the weird uncontrollable emotionsthoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since. It gets A LOT worse at night and thats when most of my issues arise.Within the last 6 months Ive seen an ear doctor to make sure I didnt have inner ear issues causing dizziness an eye exam I got a small prescription mostly for being on my phonecomputer or reading and I got an MRI done and saw a neurologist. All has always come back normal so Im thinking its a medication issue or lack of something. Im mostly looking for advice or comfort to make me feel better since Im not doing well lol.

I have severe severe severe health anxiety and I was doing really good up until a few months ago it started to get bad again but I was managing. However the past 2 weeks have been really really hard with my health anxiety and I knew I needed to finally get back on and Im so happy to be back on. I had some stomach issues and Im freaking out. I had blood in my stools and bad pains in my pelvis. I also for the past 2 months have had a dull ache in my upper left abdomen. Had some blood and stool tests and all was good. Today is day 2 is taking my medication Zoloft and I have a weird nauseating feeling in my throatchest. It feels exactly like when you get super giddy and your chestthroat squeals with excitement. But I dont feel excited I feel so anxious. Its almost like I have to gag or dry heave. Can the Zoloft be causing this? I had no side effects last time I was on it so its weird.

34310,Worried sick. So. I have had health anxiety very bad since I was a kid. Around 22 years of dealing with this since my dad died out of the blue from a heart attack when I was almost 8. It ranges from cancer to HIV to ALS and everything in between it seems like. So. On Friday last week. I noticed that I had a lymph node under my jaw on my right side that is swollen. So swollen to the point it's visible to me and other people. Last night I went to the ER because I was freaking out so bad. They told me I had strep throat and the flu and that's what was causing it. But I really have symptoms of neither. Other than a few red streaks on my throat I can see with a flashlight. No sore throat no fever no cough. Should I just trust the doctor? I really just need some calming down here. I trusted him for like 30 mins and then went back to the whole well what if they got it wrong or got my tests mixed up with someone else's thing that I do a lot.

Recently I've been getting better and even managed to get myself into a relationahip which was great.The thing is two weeks ago I noticed that I seem to struggle with gettingkeeping erections. So I obviously started Googling which was not helpfulas always as it said its mostly thing old guys get and so on. What it did notice was a terrifying thing called Venous Leak which means your veins can't trap blood for erection there is no fix for that and you're doomed. So I started stressing over this so badly I wanted to know everything about it thing is out of all my health scares I never seen a condition so poorly reported there is very little information about it and no statistics and contradicting facts which is fueling my anxiety even more. So I'm sitting here worrying that surely I must have it and seeing it seems to be very unknown I definitely have it. Has anyone heard or knows more about this? ,Anxiety

34827,IBS and Other GI Issues...Anyone Else? It's so crazy to me kind of comforting that there are 10.8 thousand subscribers. I feel slightly better knowing I'm not alone. So onto the issue at hand. I was diagnosed with IBS four years ago. Ever since I have had different episodes of constipation and diarrhea and like such intense gas discomfort that I could feel the spasms in my intestines. I've had an ultrasound to give me peace of mind that my abdomen is clear of anything sketchy. About a week ago I had an outpatient procedure done and needed to take a high dose of antibiotics. 1000mg of aziththromycin. Well I have been so constipated and I mean my water intake hasn't been the best I have been super stressed out anxious overwhelmed my diet hasn't been great...it's been mostly in n out pizza etc...and yesterday I started feeling this weird pressureuncomfortable pain in my actual butt. Like the same muscles I use to pee operates that back there too I think and it feels just not great when I pee or sit down too hard etc. Has anyone ever felt this way? I've been able to pass a little bit of poo but not much. Really trying to talk myself off the anxiety ledge thinking of bowel cancer or if the fibroid I just found out about 5 days ago might have super grown and impacted my colon...I am a straight mess guys.

For the last couple of years I worked remotely my job was calm and my colleagues were nice. Two weeks ago I started a new office job. At first felt just drained mentally and physically and I thought that this was just me adjusting to my new lifestyle but now I feel how my anxiety is back. Being locked in a small room the whole day surrounded by people that I don't know has taken a tow on my mental health. And this in only 2 weeks!I have the option to work someday of the week remotely but I was hoping to be in the office until I get a grasp of what are my daytoday tasks.So do you have any advice on how I can deal with this for at least a couple more weeks until I feel comfortable getting an home office day?,Anxiety

52446,Gaining my appetite back A few years back I decided to change my horrible diet and gain weight. I didnt realise if at the time but my diet was so bad. I once went a whole day with just eating a single yoghurt and hadnt realised how BAD that was. Well last yearor the year before? I made an effort to force myself to eat and increase my appetite. It worked. Ive gained weight and Im happy. Well I could be happier by gaining more weight but I have a fast metabolism so Im comfortable with my weight. Anyways last week I got a bug that has now lowered my appetite and Ive barely eaten anything since then. Ive now become suddenly conscious that my appetite has gone again and I need to train my stomach to eat more yet again. Its gonna take me a few days or a week but I know I can do it. Its just making me anxious at the moment because every time I eat I get full very quick just like I used to. So this next week may or may not be a pain while I get my appetite back up.,Anxiety

52666,Anticipatory anxiety ruined my chance at a vacation. I'm so tired of trying to fly and failing. 28M.I've had a lifelong fear of flying that feel wellprepared to take headon especially the fear I've had around taxiing and takeoff. I've flown before but it's gotten harder to get through the process without running out of the airport dizzy panicked and overwhelmed by guilt in the past few years.Specifically I took a program called SOAR designed to help fearful flyers manage their fightflight responses around takeoff and aviophobia or fears when the plane is in the air. I felt confident in the last few weeks that I could do this. But as I lay on my side writing this I realize I was completely unprepared for the anticipatory anxiety ahead of the flight.I woke up at 4 am this morning in a cold sweat. My extremities were numb. I couldn't get a 10minute patch of sleep in without my stomach seemingly twisting into knots. The last 17 hours has been a waking nightmare of existing in a moderate to strong panic attack state. My appetite is nonexistent. I'm barely able to drink water. Every nerve in my body is screaming at me to tell my friends that I can't go on the spring break trip we planned.It's crazy I'm a grad student and I have never felt as tired as I do now just spending this day holding myself back from tears and a full breakdown. I'm so tired that a beach doesn't sound nice right now. I just want to curl up in my bedroom with no direct sunlight to sleep to cry to indulge in selfhatred for having a response this extreme to something so commonplace in life for a lot of people. A vacation is the one thing I need right now but trying to take one via flying has destroyed me. I'm lucky that I had nothing to do today because it was not going to get done. I don't know if this thread is a message in a bottle but it helps to get it out. If anyone has been in a similar situation I'd love to hear it.I still want to fly deaparately. It's one of the big things keeping me from living my life on my terms. But having to spend almost 48 hours in utter hell is not worth it.,Anxiety

35719,The dread of thinking you have cancer... again My health anxiety has been okay for the last year or so but it's become out of control in the last few days. My poor husband keeps trying to reassure me but I'm struggling to keep myself together Firstly I've had two cold sores in the last month. That's kind of strange as usually I have an outbreak once a year maybe twice.Then about a week ago I developed a really sudden intense pain on the left side underneath my rib towards the back. I've never had a pain like that before and wasn't sure why it was happening. Luckily it went away after a few hours.I've also been waking up a few nights lately sweating a little that always starts alarm bells in my mind but I told myself it's probably because I was due for my periodThen last night I woke up with a really sore throat. I instantly got kind of nervous especially combined with the two cold sores recently. I've felt kinda warm all day but in the last few hours I feel like I'm freezing and think I might be getting a fever which never happens to me during a cold So ofc now I'm freaking out wondering if my immune system is destroyed because of Leukemia or Lymphoma. I'm trying to be calm but it's really difficult atm I'm hoping all this has been influenced by how stressed I've been for the last year but I'm still really scared. Any words of advicesupport would be incredibly appreciated rn. ,Anxiety

34674,Is face burning sensations something that can be attributed to anxiety? My life has been a big mess since August. A dizziness episode triggered my health anxiety. I suspected MS did an MRI an SSEP they found nothing. Then I moved onto ALS. Nothing again. Several neurologists said I had nothing but anxiety and still I kept thinking the opposite.In January I woke up with my right side tinglingpins and needles followed by a toothache. Of course I googled these symptoms and found Trigeminal Neuralgia a condition that checks all the boxes of a hypochondriac nightmare.I had a cavity did a root canal the toothache disappeared. But the tingling is still here and around my eye I have been dealing with burning sensations eyelid eyelashes inside the eye. It's not unbearable and maddening like those who have trigeminal neuralgia say it is but it's really uncomfortable.I've seen two major neurosurgeons about this they said I didn't have trigeminal neuralgia. I don't know I can't find peace I'm always startled nervous and expecting to be hit by a major wave of unbearable pain. I really don't know anything anymore. Don't know if is my HA causing this or if in fact I have this condition but doctors are simply being dismissive. One thing that makes me believe that my anxiety is the root is that the burning gets tuned downdisappears when I'm distracted. But it hits me again when I'm alone at home working for instance.Oh well long post already. Anyone with similar experiences? Thank you,Anxiety

Now this week or more so right now I feel flat and annoyed with everyone I feel as if Im fine and normal Im not worried about passing my exams because I feel okay but flat Ive been like this for 2 days now. I went to the doctor after years of feeling unstable recently and now today I feel as if Ive been dramatic by going to the doctor they said it sounds like I may have bipolar and I am waiting for a further mental health assessment.Many people around me tell me they think Ive got bipolar but I truly think Ive messed up by going to the doctor in the first place and actually everything is fine.When I am not feeling okay I know that actually I am unwell but I feel fine now and I dont want to talk to any other professionals about this potential bipolar diagnosis when I am fine and feeling as if this is just who I am. Sometimes Im a bubbly funny person sometimes I am very low now Ive had a professional say its potential bipolar I am in total denial of anything being wrong. I feel irritated. Can anyone relate?

I'm reading all of these horror stories about being crazy high and hallucinations that I've kind of scared myself from taking it.I dont know if I should be taking it given he doesnt know what my actual diagnosis is.

45540,UPDATE I have a 2nd job interview tomorrow Today was a heck of a day. I applied for this radio station job last week with the expectation that I would work parttime doing the news and some office work. It's not my ideal dream scenario but it's a job in radio which I love more than anything else.I walked into the interview today and knocked it out of the park. So much so that the owner is going a completely different direction with me. He offered me a morning drive show simulcast on two of their stations. They've never done a live local show on this radio station. Like...ever.I wrote this in my initial post but getting into radio was part of my therapy and mental wellbeing. The idea was that if I did something I loved that mentallycreatively stimulated me then I would be prone to having fewer episodes and just be in a better place overall.This proved to mostly work. I was able to be creative to a point but I was still restricted by someone else's parameters. This new job would offer me the chance to build something from the ground up. It's giving me the opportunity to build my own brand. I've always looked at radio as a form of art and I've just been given a blank canvas. My wife didn't know how to handle me when I came home today. She hasn't seen me like this in over a year. My moods haven't really cycled they've pretty much been low and lower. I feel higher than I've felt in a really long time. She couldn't stop smiling and hugging me.I just wanted to share this news with someone. I've been under this dark cloud for so long and it's nice to feel good about something for once. Thanks for reading.,Bipolar

45615,Horrible day.. quit my job on the first day. Hey hows it going?Some stuff happened today and I really need an outlet right now or someone to talk to without judgement... My situation is as follows Im a guy 18 years old have been struggling with bipolar for years where the hospital seems to be my second home.. recently out of an abusive relationship where I impulsively chose to pick up and leave my home my family and my everything all of a sudden to move in with my ex 1000 kilometres away with her parents... thats the extent of how my mania gets along with episodes of psychosis.Recently Ive been looking for work and I found what I thought would be a great job at a health food store I aced the interview and trial then came the first day...I went in full of smiles and just my best to be positive as Ive been in a big low lately then all of a sudden I get there and Im handed the most ridiculous jobs and well all they would do is put me down and make me feel like Im absolute fckin trash. Now I dont know if its because of my arm which they all saw covered in scars or if it was because I chose to not go to college year 11 and 12 when theyre all university graduates or students.. I dont know but they were horrible and I was pretty much in tears for my whole lunch break.. Im a fragile bloke when Im going threw a low is all I can say.. Anyways I got home having a huge anxiety attack so stressed I could feel my impulsiveness and psychotic symptoms coming out.. so I sat down chain smoked till I couldnt breathe and sent my boss an email full of excuses trying to make myself sound normal about quitting after 1 day.. I had to quit I really did if I had thrown myself into that job it would of sent me right back to my lowest low.. the thing is while I got the job I was experiencing a manic episode where I talked myself up Beyond imagninable and asked for 40 hours a week knowing I couldnt handle it but thats just the kind of stuff I do...So thats my little rant of todays horrible events if you were able to actually read it all then well thank you and send me a message if you wanna chat..

46430,Anyone ever done a liver cleanse? It honestly sounds like bullshit but Ive hit a wall recently so Im willing to expand my options a little. I was telling my pdoc about how Im struggling recovering from the holidays. When I was out of town with my family for about a week I had one beer the entire time. My four hour drive home ended up being six hours due to three separate accidents. It was taking me multiple days to recuperate it felt like I had been on a drinking binge. When I told her all this she said sometimes stress and changes in the environment can affect the way your liver functions just as much as it can affect your brain. The stress of family then being hit with an especially stressful trip from sea level to 7000 ft could have really messed things up. So Im giving this a try. She ordered some liver sauce for me. Its this gnarly tasting oil I take as soon as I wake up then thirty mins later I have to take a charcoal binder. If it were some random person telling me to ditch my meds and do a liver cleanse instead Id tell them to fuck off. But Ive been with this pdoc for almost a decade now so Im trusting her judgement. Im still on all my meds and she told me to try and be more mindful about what Im putting in my body. So Im trying to avoid the temptation of fast food even tho I dont feel like I have the energy to make healthy meals. Ive only been on it for a week so Im not expecting immediate results.

An illness that is not apparent to every day society is still an illness. I am so thankful that people have an outlet to a place like Reddit for emotional support. I appreciate you guys and I hope you guys understand the impact that this community has had on a lot of different people. Just keep humble and amazing and keep humanity going. Everybody hurts and you are worth it. Keep swimming with this. Ill swim with you. All the way.,Bipolar
45790,Afraid of being a hypochondriac The title says a lot. I saw a comment a few days back saying people with bipolar tend to be hypochondriacs as well. My first reaction was not me! Now Im not so sure.I have a UTI with kidney pain. I know this because I have chronic UTIs and have for most of my adult life. I also have a bladder that has moved lower due to having four children. ANYHOW...I know the symptoms and I have been waiting to make sure it wasnt in my head or simple dehydration before going to the doctor. Today is Saturday and thankfully his practice is open on weekends. I havent called yet but I will when they open. The pain is worse this morning.And then I realized that every time I get a cold I recheck the symptoms of the flu pneumonia etc. in order to rule those things out.If I get a rash I will look up different rashes to make sure its not some flesh eating bacteria. I had shingles behind my knees last year and wrote it off as dermatitis and didnt go to see my doctor until it hurt too much to walk.I guess Im sort of the opposite. I try to rule out worse illnesses? But then I thought hey maybe thats how you justify it but youre a hypochondriac silly.Except when it comes to UTIs. I know every symptom Ive experienced.,Bipolar
45718,Can medication kill creativity? I started taking Quetiapine Seroquel a few months ago and while I've certainly had less negative thoughts and have been more functional I feel like I'm no longer as creative as I used to be something which affects my education as well as what I do with my free time absolutely nothing. I was wondering if anyone has experienced something similar and if it's possibly a result of medication?,Bipolar
46133,My boss made a joke about bipolar disorder rant I haven't and won't be disclosing my diagnosis at work. Yesterday my boss was talking about someone outside of our company and how volatile that person's demeanor is and how he must be bipolar or something.Just a bummer... I always feel like bipolar is a deep dark secret that no one can find out. I work in a professional field where intelligence and ability to work under pressure are critical. Perceived instability would almost certainly prevent me from advancing. It's stressful to always be pretending not to be struggling. I know a lot of others are in the same boat.I would love to say I don't need this job or I could go somewhere else but the stigma is real and I'm almost positive this would be an issue anywhere...,Bipolar
47048,Long term recovery I'd been bipolar for years unmedicated. I tried to get help a fewtimes but symptoms would pass by the time I got an appointment ordidn't seem serious enough. I had a manic episode in 2015. I washospitalized and then later went to an outpatients psychosis responseservice. Was put on Olanzapine. Later I was put on fluoxetine. After awhile I came off olanzapine and have only been on fluoxetinesince 2016. I also quit drinking in 2016. All that helped and I havebeen soberstable for over 3 years now.One thing I've noticed since my psychotic episode is it's been reallyhard to make friends. I haven't made any new friends since then andI've drifted away from the ones I have. Part of this is just gettingolder I'm 29 but I've noticed when I do meet people I wouldpotentially care about I'm just not that invested. I'm also slightlyfatigued the whole time. The fatigue doesn't affect me when I'm cycletouring but then we're talking 8 hours of hard activity a day. Ican't possibly do that every day as a software developer. I cycleevery day commuting for about an hour and a half so I'm not inactive.I don't have much ambition any more and it really feels like life is passing me by. One of the most noticeable things about this is that when I was actively bipolar I would be fixated on people. I was in love with someone I'd say continuously for 9 years not the same person. But now I haven't really been attracted to anyone since I was treated. Obviously the previous thing wasn't healthy but nowadays I try to date but I just don't develop any attachment to them. I'd say it's lack of sex drive but it's broader than that because I'm also like this with potential new platonic friends. It'd be great to havesomething in the middle.I'm not sure how to approach this. I've been thinking it may be the change of being sober and treated along with the trauma of having had such a serious episode but alongside that I've been wondering if it's something more basic like emotional blunting from fluoxetine so I'm thinking of talking to my doctor but she's a GP and I don't have a dedicated psychiatrist any more. Counselling is really expensive and I used to just get it on the NHS. Not sure how to approach looking for it myself. A lot of this may not even be a bipolarspecific thing so much as like a personal developmentlife situation thing. Has anyone had experience with this kind of problem and how did you approach itwhat helped?Thanks all,Bipolar

47088,Psychosis Possible Self Harm Hi this is my first post to this subreddit and to reddit in general! I am a longtime lurker. I am sorry if it's longI was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder in late August after a manic then psychotic break that ended with 5 days in the psych ward. I did some severely outofcharacter and even violent things while in the ward. I have trouble looking back and thinking what I could have done differentlymy husband and sponsor took me to the emergency room and I said out of my mind I think that's part of it to the question does this have to do with harm to yourself or others. Then everything escalated the security guards grabbed me and moved me to a holding room. I nearly passed out from the anxiety spike. My brain was making me talk to everyone and learn their names I think as a coping mechanism. Eventually after a long time in a room with scary doctor people to my scared mind coming in and out I was driven handcuffed by police to the psych place. I am told by my therapist and friends that I am very smart and that that made things a little worse for me. My brain had SO MANY false narratives going and not only was I manic but I was in such fight or flight I ended up in seclusion rooms twice. This as you can imagine made everything tons worse. I felt so isolated. I feel traumatized still. I went back to work right after. My sponsor stopped talking to me completely and I don't have a large support group even though I have been feeling a little more connected to people daytoday. I want to go back and change everything I want to believe that the right thing happened but being completely ignorant to what I could do I said things that led to the worst situation for me. The ward experience seemed to make everything a lot worsethe delusions the mania the disconnectedness the alienation overmedicating etc. I am now pretty stable and on a mood stabilizer hydroxyzine and a sleep med. How do you all cope with decisions that you or your loved ones made for you that you wish went differently? How do you deal with the trauma of hospitalization? I know everyone has different even positive experiences. Mine was not that. It's hard not to let it eat at me and get angry. Thanks for listening.,Bipolar
45559,How to tell when it is time to call it quits and also when it is time to try again I've got a lot going on in my life having just gotten out of my second psychotic episodehospitalization of the new year moving to a new apartment transitioning from school to Real Adult TM 95 and other adult stuff etc.I am about to start a full time internshiptemp job at an engineering firm but I am concerned about my ability to perform given that I've only recently come out of an intense episode and am not even sure if I'm out of the woods fully yet and am unable to even read a novel atm. So when do I know if it's time to work something out with HR? Do I start and wait for a disaster?On the flip side I'm applying to full time jobs following the internship. I've put the applications on hold because I'm an engineer and because of the aforementioned problems I'm really not up to technical interviews right now.So for the former when do I bail out and for the latter when do I start trying again?I guess this question is more general than the precise scenarios I listed I'll of course listen to my supporters irl but I just wanted to get the internet's perspective.,Bipolar

45860,Do any other women impulsively cut off their hair during episodes? I've done this a couple of good times but I'm so upset with the most recent incident which was in October of past year. It took me so long to grow my hair out and then in a mixed episode aggravated by Klonopin withdrawal I chopped it all off. ??During manic episodes I typically will bleach my hair you see and in my mixed state I felt like I should not be a blonde my hair should be it's natural dark color to reflect my depression or whatever. A rational person would have dyed their goddamn hair but no I cut it down to the roots. WHY AM I LIKE THIS? ??,Bipolar
46069,Could I have Bipolar? I recently went to a psychologist after an intervention from my family because I had textbook severe depression for a couple months. The psychologist said I had a lot of red flags for bipolar 1. I was sleeping 14 hours a day and taking NyQuil without my parents knowing to stop suicidal thoughts. I would rather be asleep than deal with thoughts. I was skipping school practice and extracurriculars and then failing tests. When I wasn't asleep I was in bed in a dark room just staring at the ceiling. To be all honest though it started before the depression. 6 months ago I was extremely paranoid. I was staying up all hours of the night checking corners and simulating what I would do if someone came into my house to attack me. It got really bad because I was sleep deprived and it devolved from just being paranoid of strangers to my close friends watching their every move to see if they were out to get me like my thoughts were making me believe. Out of nowhere I started dissociating soon there would be 10 minute chunks of time where my brain would just disappear and I didn't know where it went. After this I started to get paranoid delusions where I would believe the alien gods that live in a black hole were going to abduct me because I knew about them. I had a panic attack during my lunch period. At this point I had no idea what was going on I thought I was going crazy but because I even had that thought I knew I wasn't. Now this is where things went really downhill. I woke up one day with the best mood I've ever had. When I was at school everybody thought I was high just because of the way I was acting. I was all spaced out and I talked over everyone. Nothing I said made any sense. No one really thought anything of it though because everybody assumes I smoke weed because of my personality. I was functioning on 120 with less than 2 hours of sleep per night. All of my inhibitions left me at this stage. I started smoking on school property and also selling weed on school property. This is not something I would ever do because I'm a straight A student and I'm top of my class so this has especially a lot of risk. I was also very close to doing cocaine. This lasted for a week and a half. After all of this I came down really hard and this is when my depression started as I explained above. I told all of this to my psychologist and she recommended me to see a psychiatrist as soon as possible because my manic like periods are dangerous. The thing is is I don't was to go to a psychiatrist because then it is more real and I might be too young to even get a mood disorder diagnosis. Oh yeah I forgot to mention I'm 15. I wanted to post this because I am so lost as to what to do. My mother is very concerned because of my depression symptoms and she is pressuring me to go. I'm conflicted. Should I go to the psychiatrist if so should I go asap or should I wait a couple of years?,Bipolar
50278,Happiness After 15 years of misery trying countless meds being hospitalized multiple times enduring 4 suicide attempts I have achieved happiness and peace.

49596,Are things going to get any better? So... I usually don't post anything on Reddit but here we go.About eight months ago I was diagnosed with BP2. I've struggled with mental health issues all my life anxiety depression and developed PTSD at a pretty young age. After a few years of fluctuating emotions I went to see a psychologist and I got my diagnosis. I was also diagnosed with asperger's syndrome back in 2019.I've been on a mood stabilizer lamictal since I was diagnosed and it's made things easier for me but exam season last year of high school is coming up and I lowkey feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm experiencing mixed moods every other week I can't really sleep anymore and every day I'm torn between ignoring everyone around me freaking out or acting friendly because I know I shouldn't take my own mental illness out on anyone. I'm either tired stressed occasionally productive or filled with a kind of selfloathing and sadness that I can't even begin to describe. I'm worried I'll be thrown straight into a depressive episode soon because stress is my biggest trigger. Very few people two of my friends and my immediate family know that I'm bipolar and I don't even want to tell them about how I feel right now. I think a lot of people on here can relate to that crushing feeling that you're a burden to your loved ones even when they tell you you're not. I considered the possibility that things might get better if I told someone but I just don't have the energy and I don't want to let people in because I'm ashamed that I'm losing control. Explaining how I feel to someone is difficult asperger's yay and there aren't many people I trust with my emotions. The people I trust are the ones I don't want to burden.I wanted to ask does it get any easier? Not to board the selfpity train or anything but I'm not even 20 and thinking about the future terrifies me. I don't want to fall apart and fake that I'm okay every time a problem arises. I don't want to isolate myself because I'm scared of affecting people. I don't want to experience all these episodes over and over again. I just... don't know what to do right now.Also if anyone has any advice on how to keep going and staying productive I'd really appreciate it. lt3,Bipolar

50091,Imposter Syndrome and anxiety about learning more about this disorder Hi. This post could be triggering to others with imposter syndrome so I want to start off by saying that these are my own anxieties my goal here is to know if anyone else has felt this way and if they've been able to circumvent it. I was officially diagnosed with BP2 by my psychiatrist in the fall but had previously been diagnosed with a general mood disorder and major depressive disorder and a suggestion of cyclothymia from a therapist. Bipolar 2 makes sense to me it tracks with situations and periods of my life where I was feeling unnaturally confident and fun in a dangerous way and more often the periods where I've been unable to get out of bed or the house for weeks. Still I have this weird fear of learning more about Bipolar Disorder because there's a part of me that fears that if I read about it indepth I might start mirroring symptoms that I don't usually experience. Sometimes this includes even browsing or participating in this sub and rbipolar2.I think being medicated with varied success also plays into that but I also think that's just a common bipolar experience you find good meds and then you wonder if you're even bipolar. I feel that way when they work but I keep on taking them. And then I will have breakthrough depression after years of being more stable on meds and I wonder if it's a sign that I have something else wrong with me. So to those that have survived imposter syndrome... How? Is there a way to not be afraid to learn about your own medically diagnosed disorder... Or to just accept that I have this disorder without constantly questioning myself?,Bipolar
50034,Being stable is so fucking boring After multiple years of suffering from different combinations of Bipolar BPD narcissism ADHD symptoms and OCD symptoms I am 90 symptomfree. I still have anxiety attacks sometimes but like once a week if that and certain phobias and have to control my OCD symptoms with some rigid scheduling but my depression splitting hyper fixations and attention issues are effectively gone. And I'm so fucking bored. None of the things that made me feel good do that anymore but I don't feel bad because it all came from avoidance. I'm used to fighting depression 100 of the time and without that I'm listless.So what do you do with this? Does anyone have any advice? DBT and IFS suggestions especially appreciated.,Bipolar

I know that it's unlikely Republicans would ever get around to actually doing anything because it would require a shit ton of money to bring back asylums but it's just making the stigma so much worse. I'm in training to become a teacher and I'm terrified of the day they decide people with bipolar disorder aren't safe around kids. Anyone else feeling the stigma especially bad right now? What are you doing to try to stay calm and carry on?,Bipolar
46191,Happy New Year! Here's my Resolution I want to notice the times when I am alright. Really notice them stop to think hey my mood is okay right now I'm not anxious and I'm safe. Taking a moment to just feel my body and appreciate my surroundings. This has been so helpful to me lately. I'm climbing out of a small depression caused by a medication problem lithium level got a bit low while tapering off another med. I'm also kind of stressed out by some life stuff outside of my control it's not terrible more just annoying but I don't like it. I kind of have to realize something always comes up. There are no perfect stretches of time where work isn't stressful a social situation isn't stressful etc. But I have a roof over my head food in my pantry and love ones around me. I want to notice that it's okay right now.There are three times when a potentially bad thing can hurt you. You can get anxious before it happens if it happens. You can have it happen. And then you can ruminate and dwell on it. I know I can't always control what happens to me but I do want to get better at reducing anxiety and rumination. When I think back on events I want to tell myself a story that is neutral not one that makes it worse. I don't want to invent problems or spin existing problems out of control. It's hard but these two things are my mental health resolutions for 2019. I want to appreciate the good moments and I want to do my best to ensure that bad ones only hurt me once.Disclaimer I'm talking about my own anxiety and rumination over small problems this isn't meant to dismiss traumatic events that you will naturally feel a lot of anxiety around and ruminate about. Terrible and traumatic things happen. This is more about not spending the entire day worrying about something inconsequential. ,Bipolar

49748,Bipolar things I need to talk about Hi all!First of all I just want to say that this page has been so helpful and reassuring for me. I was diagnosed a few years ago with bipolar 2. For me I experience more hypomania. For a while I was misdiagnosed until a few years ago when I experienced a manic episode and threw myself out of a moving car then was taken to a mental hospital lol. Its not funny but it is to me. After that I was able to get my meds under control and my diagnosis. I have been on meds since I was 13 I am 28 now. I was diagnosed in 2018. I am still having trouble coping with it sometimes I feel like I have a split personality. Sometimes I want to die and slam my head in to a wall. I get overstimulated easily at time and will randomly cry. Most people dont understand how to handle me. More recently I have been turning to cocaine to help because I just miss the happy high periods. Does anyone else struggle with substance abuse??,Bipolar
45513,Well Im bipolar. Hey folks. After a very shitty year where I lost our house to foreclosure our savings and nearly did in my loving family wife and two daughters 13 and 10 Ive been diagnosed as bipolar. The psychiatrist has me on a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant for now which seem to be helping. Theyre still making a full assessment so weve got a ways to go as yet. My wife has been amazing despite the shock of the foreclosure and all the monetary problems shes stayed with me and helped me find well recommended doctors and therapists for help. Weve been going through couples counseling as well to help us get on the same page the couples counselor suggested I might be bipolar which started us working through the diagnosis process and into treatment. My kids havent been told of the diagnosis yet and were not sure if or when we will tell them or how. Personally Im a little freaked out. Ive already been diagnosed as ADD which seems to also be correct but that seems a lesser issue since I am able to hyper focus and accomplish a lot. Or maybe that was a combination of hyper focus and manic episodes. Im having trouble coming to terms with whos right now. Its been a hard blow and has fractured my self image. Ive always considered myself in control of my mind and actions and now I really dont know what Im in control of any more. Its been surreal and Ive been feeling a little lost. I dont have any specific questions at this time I partly wrote this to just make the diagnosis more real. Any comments anyone can provide are welcome. Ive got so much to learn. ,Bipolar
49768,Young bipolar woman hoping for future Hello everyone First I'm French so sorry if my english is not perfect perfect. I'm 24 years old living in Paris and apparently bipolar type 1 with intense psychotic features. My life was almost totally hell for several years after my diagnosis. The doctors didn't correctly adjust my medication and I already have undergo more than 2 very big crisis. Since we have discovered that I needed neuroleptic my life has changed for the best. Despite my age I'm still in an undergraduate program at university. In fact my disease has caused many issues during my school and university years. I would love to become a documentarian somebody who work in the field of documentation information.... I want to have my first job in the public domain in less than two or three years. I have a boyfriend since 5 years and I would love to build a life with him. He's already working since several years so I'm eager to work so we can advance.I would like to have a family one or two children and a house in a place that we would love. BUT I have to be realistic. Since my diagnosis I had more than 2 very big crisis and many littles ones. I have decided since two years to perfectly take my traitement. So my life is better now. But in 2022 I had a hypomaniac and next mixte episode which cause many problems in my study program. I'm in the obligation to do one year in two years because I have too much delay. To be precise my doctor and I had change Zyprexa to Abilify. The Abilify was at 15mg the lithium that I take too was too low....So there was a crisis. Now I'm hoping that the augmentation of lithium and Abilify will be relevant and protective for the years to come. Moreover I decided to establish a more protective routine. I began yoga stopped alcool...But I really need to be stable in the years to come in order to succeed in my academics and in my life in general.Do you think it is possible ? Are my dreams impossible ? Do you think my stabilization in the long run is possible ? I precise that recently a doctor said me that with this treatment it wasn't impossible to be stabilized for me but I don't know if I can believe him.,Bipolar

49714,I had multiple IG accounts when I was manic just found out one account was public... this is so embarrassing shocking Anyone have a similar experience?When I became completely manic it felt like I had to use different persona for a different group of people and also had this idea that my exes and toxic people were stalking me. So I had over 6 IG accounts. At least. There might be more because I also had THREE phones back then.I just charged one of the phones I frequently used during the last manic episode and found out it has been public for over a year when I thought all my accounts were private. I am so embarrassed because I don't know who's seen it. Probably a lot of my old coworkers because I might have asked one of them who was my best friend to tag me on his account. Maybe my friends who left me during an earlier manic episode saw the account. I don't know. I cannot believe I left it to be seen by the whole world... I wonder that is why my ex cut me off entirely when we used to be friends even after we broke up. I wonder that's why some people randomly said earlier this year they thought I was taken to a hospital.Anyway I don't know if I will be able to sleep tonight. Now I am actually laughing out loud because this is just unbelievable. This almost feels like I'm in a movie where the protagonist is stuck in this limbo of facing all the crazy manic shit from the past everyday. Sometimes I try to be grateful for the things I still have. Sometimes I'm glad I finally accepted that I have this mental illness. But today... this shook me to the core and I guess I do still care a lot about things I swore I could not care about any more. It feels like everything was part of this weird movie that was filmed... and it had no script was directed by a nasty unprepared directionless amateur director who wanted to see what kind of extreme things I could do or say that would not make sense to the old me.This is just like a cherry on top of my bipolar cake.

46156,possibly bipolar diagnose. Goodmorning people!Just a short introduction..For a long time now I've been experiencing symptoms such asIndecisive as F. I CHANGE MY MIND ALL THE TIME. I can't seem to relate to anything...It's really bad. I can't stay at a job as soon as I get an idea let's say traveling or doing something else I quit my job leave my apartment and the idea just slowly dies. Then I start aaaall over again finding a job a new place to stay new idea BAM. Same vicious circle.I have moodswings like crazy. Depressed periodsdays and not so depressed periodsdays.On my depressed periodsdays I Tend to isolate myself disable all my social media turn off my phone. I get irritable and angry about the smallest things for no reason. My creativityconfidence level goes to 0 so it's like i've never played on my guitar before or sung a song. And of course the overthinking everything like crazy it gets so bad that I can't even answer a simple yes or no question without having to overthink it. And I always know that as soon as I answer the question I wouldwill change my mind straight away.On my good daysperiods I get crazy.. hyper and active?Spend money on random stuffGet 1000 of ideas but never follow through with one of them.Confidence is SKY HIGH and I can do everything. I sleep 34 hours max and im good to go. Relationship wise I really quickly lose interest. All of a sudden I just cut off contact without letting the person Or i do the opposite and get way to clingy and deep. So yesterday I've simply had enough. I went to the doctor told him all this and he referred my to a psychiatrist which I will be seeing in 45 weeks... He couldn't tell me 100 what it was and im just clueless on what to do. Can anyone of you relate to any of this?,Bipolar

46855,I dont want to be me anymore. Bipolar 2 currently depressed. Just took another stab at meds and had side effects as usual and had to come off. I get worse and worse as time passes. Hopeless. Helpless. A shell of myself. The roller coaster ride of this illness and the meds takes an enormous toll. Im scared to go back on meds scared not too. I get every side effect Ive even had gene testing and the meds that are suited to my DNA still give me awful side effects. I dont really know why Im posting guess I just had to vent. Thanks. ,Bipolar

46992,Bipolar and PPD Hi everyone. Im really really struggling today. I was diagnosed with bipolar ll in 2010. I gave birth to my first child in June of 2016. While pregnant I was on a very low dose of my medications I had taken before I became pregnant. We were not trying to get pregnant but ended up conceiving on our wedding night. After giving birth I started suffering from PPD. I hated my daughter wanted absolutely nothing to do with her. I sought treatment at a private hospital that had a motherbaby ppd program. I had my tubes tied to prevent another pregnancy and I thought that was a great idea. I thought I was one and done. After the tubal ligation I had a lot of other complications which lead to my having a full hysterectomy. I guess the reason that Im struggling is because I so badly want to have another child. I want my daughter to have a sibling. I want to bless my home with another little blessing. My daughter is now the biggest joy in my life. Of course I still struggle with my bipolar. Im on a constant roller coaster. I do know that if you have ppd with an early pregnancy you are bound to have it with one that follows. I honestly dont know why Im posting this and not sure if I will go through with posting it. I cant talk to my husband about this because he definitely does not want another child. Im just so heart broken today,Bipolar

47000,Is it possible to be put back on a med and have a completely different reaction to it even if not much time has passed? I was put on Zyprexa earlier this year and it showed promise but it really messed with my blood sugar so I talked my doc into taking me off of it and going back on Latuda. The Latuda wasn't working as well I made sure to take it with enough calories so that wasn't the issue so my doctor put me back on the Zyprexa and we're going to work with my primary care doctor to manage my sugars more aggressively. I started the Zyprexa Friday and since then I've been just miserable. Is this a known thing that happens? Does anyone have any experience with Zyprexa?To be clear I'm not looking for advice on medications to try or dosing or anything other than personal experiences. I'm just wondering if anyone has had med switches change up their effects like this andor if they're had Zyprexa cause major negative mood shifts.Thanks.,Bipolar
45938,Running out of meds to try I'm so jealous of people who've been on their meds for years and they work for them. I however can't find a med that works for me. It's been over 3 years and I've gone through pretty much every med out there. Some work for a bit and then stop. Some I have horrible side effects. Right now I stopped Zyprexa about 2 weeks ago because I gained 15 pounds in two weeks and that's a deal breaker for me. So now I have no clue what I'm going to take. I have to be medicated or else bad things happen. Not really sure if anyone can help I'm just sort of ranting. ,Bipolar
49477,Being the crazy lady Im 61 now and was diagnosed bipolar 1 at 28. Its quite severe I get psychotic and inhabit a whole alternate reality. Despite taking meds religiously all these years and trying so many different combos I still average one manic episode per year and they can go on for months. The consequences of the episodes have been serious especially when younger. I havent been able to hold a job and am on disability. Unlike many of you that I see here I am often not able to catch myself and once its at a certain point I lose all insight and am belligerent if people try to suggest Im not ok. Last year I seemed to have a good year and felt more hopeful and optimistic than for some time. But that came crashing down when I was suddenly arrested and dragged off to hospital in the New Year Id done nothing criminal but I guess I mustve been acting strange. One of the hardest things for me is the shame and humiliation for how I acted when manic while being adamant that there was nothing wrong with me. In retrospect I could have been seriously harmed or worse when I used to roam around the streets at night and do risky things. Nowadays I mostly just post obnoxious nonsense online and get myself banned or blocked. Ive lost friends like many of us. That irresistible desire to communicate seeks an outlet you know?I just wondered if anyone could relate.,Bipolar
49691,Slamming on the breaks Hi I am curious if any of you have techniques on how to stop a hypomanic episode that doesnt include popping an AP pill. For me I find that doing a lot of cardio or eating a highcarb meal a bowl of pasta slows my brain down.,Bipolar
49746,I am sober 72 days and trying to resist ending my sobriety. I am no longer taking my meds right and going to buy weed. Where do I turn to for help? Story inside I recently went through a very distressing breakup where he cut me out of his life completely. I don't have any family or friends to call they all tell me to talk to a professional. So I blocked them. No sense causing strife.My psych doctor doesn't answer emails my family doctor doesn't have an email or phone number my therapist doesn't give out her number or respond to emails. I don't know where to turn in crisis. The wait at my ER is 12 hours or more.I don't have a sponsor yet or anyone from AA to call. Meetings make me sad because I am not ruining my life with alcohol I have nothing to ruin even if I tried. Bipolar takes those things away from you.I really want to go buy it. Everyone tells me not to drink but doesn't want to support me when times get hard. I understand they have their own problems and it's not personal but I NEED HELP. I only fucking stopped drinking beduse a psych doctor said it would help my moods and how my drugs process through my body but I've never felt worse. It's been 72 days and no end in sight for the pain. I am no longer taking my meds right and going to buy weed. I am done. I will take the psychosis risk. I'll take maniamWhere do I go? Is there a helpline I can call when I need immediate support to not buy alcohol? I don't feel suicidal so I'm not sure if that is acceptable.Let me repeat in caps. I DO NOT FEEL SUICIDAL I am in pain and self destructive. There is a difference.,Bipolar

45834,Looking for resources on being supportive Coming from nba after viewing a mental health post there.I'm looking for knowledgeresources on how to help and be a support system for my girlfriend.She let me know beforehand that she was bipolar and gave me opportunities to not pursue a relationship with her. I really care about her so I let her know I appreciate it but that I'd really like to build something with her.Most recently she lost her meds when I was visiting and it totally shook her. One night she started to have a manic episode Idk what the correct term is and she was crying and laughing and rolling around on the bed.I tried to comfort her but honestly I had no clue what to do. She couldn't talk after a point and was texting me saying it felt like if she talked that she'd completely lose it. She needed me to leave so I left but I felt scared and awful that I couldn't do anything for her. I didn't want to leave also because I was worried about possible suicidal tendencies.I feel like this is something I'll have to talk to her more about but atm she isn't ready to open up about the topic and I don't want to force the issue just yet.I'm stuck in between wanting to give her the space she needs and wanting to do everything I can to become the support system she needs. I don't feel her family provides her with it.Sorry this got longer than I wanted but what are some things that I can do to help? What helps those here that go through this?Apologies if anything I said was politically incorrect I'm here to learn and soak up the knowledge. ,Bipolar
50093,Bipolar Disorder and Incurable Stds Hi I hope this is allowed here. Wasn't sure if I should post it here or somewhere else. It's kinda really hard to post this. So I have bipolar mania. I haven't received treatment for it in years. I would love to eventually get treatment. I also am pretty sure I have an incurable STD. Not asking for any diagnoses or anything. Is it okay to ask if anybody else does too? I have this very strong feeling I'm not good enough to have friends or relationships because of all these things. ie to keep people safe away from meno one wants to be around someone like that probably. This makes it easier when I'm having a depressive episode to push everyone away without thinking I'm doing so. I feel like just the thought makes my depressive episodes worse. Does anybody else feel this way? How do they get through feeling this way? I'm constantly trying to convince myself that I still deserve to have a good happy life and people that love me. Would you be friends with someone if you knew that they had an incurable disease?,Bipolar

49844,Just need to vent Sorry this post is a huge mess. I just need to let everything out and I don't know who to go to right now who would understand my situation. So I'm 17 got diagnosed on my birthday quick fun fact I guess lol and moved out of my parent's into an entirely different state back in January. I was doing completely fine and actually felt on top of the world for awhile. I did some exams that allowed me to graduate early before moving told myself and everyone I'll get a new job and start college as soon as I can. I haven't been able to get a job here yet so I have been doing commissions to hold me off for a while. I was doing really good with that making about 80200 a week which held me off pretty well I'm living with my boyfriend who lives with his mom so I don't have to pay rent or anything just need to buy stuff for myself and my cat everything was going good. I had to stop my meds after I moved because my psychiatrist isn't licensed in this state plus the side effects for the meds I was currently on gave me really bad tardive dyskinesia. My boyfriend's mom has been pressuring me more and more recently to get a job sending me links for places to apply to more and I've been applying to them. The other night I had a conversation with my parents I'm still on good terms with them and my mom noticed I must be manic because I told her I've been unable to get much sleep at all due to my mind constantly racing. She said she wants me to come visit home asap because she has bipolar too and based on her experience she doesn't want me being unmedicated and manic in an entirely different state especially when the depression comes. I told my boyfriend's mom this and she was really disappointed saying that she doesn't want me to constantly visit back and forth again before I moved I would visit for a couple weeks very often and that I'm supposed to have a job by now and that basically if I'm going to be doing this I should just move back until Im 18. I seriously don't want to move back though. I love my parents and everything and I want to just visit not move back entirely. I'm happier here with my boyfriend finally have myself settled and comfortable here and I'm worried if I move back I'll get addicted to bad habits again because my mental health was a lot worse there. My parents and my boyfriend's mom had a whole dispute and I was in the middle of it and since then I just feel like it triggered something in me and now I feel miserable and sick and scared. I'm sleeping constantly and when I wake up I have messages from my boyfriend's mom telling me to apply to some place along with messages from my parents asking when I'll be visiting. I don't want to disappoint or upset either of them with what I do and I don't know what'll be best for me staying here and getting a job or risking it and going back to get my mental health worked on. I haven't been able to draw much at all since then and I fell behind on my commissions which is making me feel worse and I just don't know what to do right now. I feel stuck and I just want to cry and sleep and ignore all these issues. I haven't felt this shitty in so long I can't bring myself to do anything and I keep suddenly crying several times a day when I'm awake.Sorry if this issue seems trivial or anything. I just have an extreme fear of disappointing people which makes this all so much worse for me. I really want to visit my parents and get on something that'll help me but I'm worried that if I go my boyfriend's mom won't allow me to come back and I don't want to upset her with my decision since she keeps telling me to apply to the places she's sending me and I'm telling her I will so she won't get upset.I don't know what I want from this post. I just know I needed to let this all out. If anyone reads this all then personal input or advice is welcome. I'm not sure what to do right now I need to make a decision quick but I can't bring myself to,Bipolar
49888,After years of resistance Im finally considering going on Disability. So I started my mental health journey at the age of 20. I was initially diagnosed Bipolar 2 and tried a number of medications that either didnt work or made me worse.The bad experience with medication caused me to take a break from medication off and on. Around the age of 25 I was hospitalized for a manic episode. A year later when I was 26 I was hospitalized again for another manic episode.Finally around the age of 27 I started seeing a new psychiatrist and she put me on Abilify and to my surprise I finally felt stable happy and normal.Over the years I have had to adjust my Abilify every now and again but can usually get stable fairly quickly.Until now. I began having hypomanic symptoms about a week ago so we raised my Abilify to 30MGS and added 5MGS of Zyprexa.Maybe Im being impatient its only been two days but Im still having hypomanic symptoms. And on top of that Im having balance and coordination issues.My fear is that the Abilify is no longer working and I am accepting the possibility that I may have to start from square one.Which means medication trial and error and with my past bad experiences with medication I may be completely dysfunctional for God knows how long.Which leads me to considering possibly going on Disability. I know its not easy to get and could take up to a year to receive benefits which is a concern.I also feel going on Disability may lower my self esteem. To be clear I dont judge others that are on it who really need it. Its just a personal issue I have I really want to work and function in the real world.And I know you also have to jump through a bunch of hoops to get Disability and even when Im stable I tend to give up easily.So yeah. I guess Im posting because Im really on the fence about this. Im scared worried and feel shame. Thanks to whoever reads this or replies.,Bipolar

50373,I dont know what happened to me Hi currently I am not diagnosed I hope it does not bother anyone but bipolar type 2 is being suspected by my psychiatrist. And I had some doubts I'm not asking for diagnosis because lately I have been going through dark days but today something extremely strange happened to me that I do not know how to name or explain to my psychiatrist. If anyone has felt this way I would appreciate it if you could tell me about your experience please. I was talking with a friend about my emotions and I remember that from one moment to the next I got caught up in a specific thought like a delusion. And then it was like I had emotionally exploded I felt out of myself I started sobbing very loudly my breathing was heavy I couldn't control or stop myself. But it wasn't like the moment or the conversation led me to it because of the intensity it just happened. I was hugging myself I couldn't stand him touching me. I felt like I was getting small. I really have no idea how to explain it but what was most impressive to me was how spontaneous it was and that feeling of not being in control of my own body. After that i felt numb and confused.,Bipolar

It lasted until my dad woke up for work hours later. Has anyone experienced something like this?,Bipolar
45721,Health effects of longterm gt6 years use of lamotrigine? Particularly related to chronic inflammation and lowgrade flulike symptoms Hi allI've been on 250mg lamotrigine for about 6 years now. It works fantastically. However during the same period I've slowly developed a kind of background inflammation that's basically the same as very minor flu. It's there almost all the time some days better than others and is sometimes accompanied by muscle achessprains and a slightly sore throat. I also feel like I'm extra warm to the touch.No doubt the timing is purely coincidental and I have some other problem but I figured it was worth researching. Unfortunately however I can't find much about longterm usage and the only articles that refer to those symptoms are acute allergic responses.Do any of you have viewsexperiences here? Naturally I'll pursue it with my doctor too.Thank you!,Bipolar
46049,Psych doc put me on Buspirone. Thoughts? Experiences? I've been in the midst of a serious depressiveanxiety ridden phase for weeks now. Rather than increase my Cymbalta and risk a manic episode the doc put me on Buspirone 15 mg 2xs a day. This shit sure works. And by works I mean I'm too damn tired to do anything. You can't have panic attacks when you're dizzy and laying in bed 18 hours a day. I called up my therapist and told her I'm discontinuing the Buspirone. The psych doc will be calling me tomorrow. Has anyone had experience with this medication? How much did it effect you? I feel like I'm back on seroquel and that's NOT a good thing.,Bipolar

49835,Being self aware and mentally ill is fucking exhausting. Does anyone else struggle with this? It's like you know that your being irrational and there is nothing that you can do about it no matter how hard you try. So last night in the middle of my manic episode I just had this moment apologizing to my partner for keeping him up with my crying. I didn't sleep at all and I just was angry about that. I'm really good at masking most of the time. I have to be as I work in retail. But then I come home and sometimes I absolutely unravel. The part about this is that my logical bits of my brain know better. I know that all the terrible things my brain tells me during my episodes is not true. I know that I can do better. It's as if I'm paralyzed and there's a disconnect between all the parts of my brain. It's fucking horrible and exhausting! I am medicated I am really bad at remembering to take my medications so do you have any tips to help this? I also have a slew of other alphabet soup stuff going on with me. I just needed to vent and could use some advice. I'm newly diagnosed with bipolar within the past 12 months. Any advice is greatly appreciated!,Bipolar

I can't even ask for help from them because how am I meant to say this in a way that will show them that I love them and I'm not accusing them and I'm not crazy and I just want to have control over myself and my emotions and my thoughts. I just want to feel happy I want to stop making everyone miserable I want to be in on the joke that everyone else around me is in on. I feel so scared and angry and confused,Bipolar
46737,Has anyone else felt written off by a medical professional once they find out you're on Bipolar medication? I went to the emergency room this morning for chest pain feeling faint and uncontrollable shaking. I've been experiencing chest pains and shortness of breath headaches bouts of weakness and an inability to control my body temperature recently and it was so intense this morning I felt it warranted getting check out. This was the sickest I had ever felt in my life. After getting to a room the Dr came in quickly looked at my info and asked about the lamictal and when I last had my levels checked. She said they'd do a blood test to check and left. Someone came to draw my blood and did an ekg. A while later the nurse came back to let me know I'd been discharged. I wasn't checked out by the Dr when the heart rate and bp would go crazy no one came to check my resting heart rate would jump up to 150bpm my blood pressure would shoot up too. I had to ask about the test results as I recieved the discharge papers as no one came back to let me know. They just checked my lamictal levels and said I was good to go. I was embarrassed when I left as I was still feeling sick and people in the waiting room watched me warble out and were asking if I was ok. Is this a thing that happens? A Dr sees the bp diagnosis and medication and decides whatever's going on is simply a medication or bp issue? I'm doubting myself if I should have waited to see if I actually passed out or waited until it got worse before going in? The experience just left me bummed and self conscious.,Bipolar
50386,I started Wellbutrin yesterday I can't tell if it's placebo or not but I already feel slightly more productive. Finally got around to renewing my library card I've been meaning to for the past 35 weeks but got discouraged when I had called on a day they were closed and didn't feel like doing it even when I knew they were open. I'm also playing more of my video games even though it was only 2 games it's still a huge step for me. I'm excited to see my hobbies come back. Hopefully I'll finally go outside on a walk on my own eventually it's been a few yearsI'm also taking Lithium which used to work for my depression. I've pretty much been taking only Lithium for the past 5 years and never thought I'd see the day I add another pill. I'm glad I wasn't scared about taking something new either,Bipolar
46727,I quit smoking weed and my life has gotten way better I was diagnosed bipolar 2 about a year and a half ago but I havnt had the opportunity to go on meds yet because Ive been moving around a lot lost my insurance bullshit like that. I started smoking weed for the first time during a manic episode about 6 months ago and smoked nightly no matter what my mood state was. If I was manic I would smoke all day everyday to feel less up and if I was depressed or baseline I smoked to wind down at night or to distract myself from being depressed. I swore by weed and told all my friends it was actually making me more stable but I see now that I was just numbing my symptoms. I was in a manic episode for the last month of these 6 months this recent February. Every night during this month the smoking started giving me 3 hour panic attacks. It started slowly maybe the first week I would just get paranoid about stuff like cops and then I started hearing voices ontop of the paranoia and then I slowly became convinced that I secretly had some medical issues that could kill me every second and then finally the last week or two I would smoke and just become completely convinced I would die in my sleep. This even happened at a party I didnt even smoke that much but began hearing voices and had to leave the party early. It was humiliating. And being convinced youre going to die is very traumatizing especially when it happens night after night. I would be laying in my bed shaking too high to even cry and praying to god to forgive me for my sins since I was going to die that night all while listening to classical music to try and calm down and hearing voices speak over the music. Finally I just said why the fuck am I paying for weed paying to have these panic attacks? So I threw it all away. This was about a week ago and Ive been a week sober for the first time in 6 months. I can already notice myself returning back to normal. I hadnt realized how much weed was affecting my brain even when I wasnt high. I have wayyy less anxiety whereas when I was smoking I was wondering why I was suddenly developing anxiety. I wake up feeling refreshed and not still high from the night before. I dont think every little ache and pain in my body is secretly cancer or something thats going to make me magically drop dead. Im not paranoid about cops busting in and arresting me for no reason. I was derealized for a long time and nothing felt real and now everything feels real again. I hadnt realized how fucked up weed was making me. I guess I wanted to post this because Ive seen people on here say the same things I used to swear by that weed is ok to self medicate with and that it actually reduces your symptoms. If you start getting paranoid when you smoke you need to stop before it becomes psychotic panic attacks like i was having. I finally feel like Im returning back to my normal self. Im not even sad about having to quit like I imagine doing Id be. I have literally no desire to smoke anymore Id do anything if it means I didnt have to suffer another 3 hour panic attack of hearing voices and saying farewell to the world as I fall asleep and prepare to die. So yah use weed if you want. But be aware that it gets bad very quickly and likely is affecting you when youre not high and you dont even realize it. Take a week off and see what happens. ,Bipolar
50170,Job Advice Does anyone have a job where they travel? Ive been thinking of transitioning from a job where I travel around 10 counties to one in two states. There would be overnight travel for a couple days each week. I have a super stable government job now but the new one would align more with my interests. Im probably pushing the limits of my stability with this one,Bipolar
45594,My cat just died.... She wasnt even a full year old yet. Around 2am tonight I realized I hadnt seen her since the morning so I looked for her. Finally found her under my bed. She wasnt waking up when I called her and when I reached out to her she was rock hard and cold. I had to pull her stiff body out to the middle of my bedroom floor and absolutely fucking lost it. Shed probably been dead since midday. Picking her up and walking her to my car and from my car into the pet hospital sent me even more over the edge. I couldnt handle it. I dont know what to do. Neither I nor the technicians know what happened. I dont know what to fucking do. She was my medicine. She was my fucking cure for this stupid fucking disease and made me feel like maybe I had a purpose and she was the one thing who made me feel loved. Gave me the purest and most wholesomely full heart. I havent felt love like that...maybe ever. I felt a little less fucking lonely in this endless depression because I had someone who would sleep with me and be close to me and make me feel loved. And she fucking died. I cant handle this. I have no one to hug me and no one to hold me right now because my closest friend is on a ship in the middle of the fucking ocean for who knows how much longer. I just. really? really. This has to be a joke. Im fucking done. Im so fucking over this life and feeling cold and alone and not being able to hold onto any kind of fucking love I get. I keep thinking that this is karma for just being a shit person inside. I hate myself. I hate this. I just want to love and feel fucking loved. and now. she died.,Bipolar

46112,Finding help Hi So I dont know how to start this I dont know If Im bipolar but thats what Im looking to find out. Since late middle school Ive felt depressive moods cut myself for 3years started partying doing drugs and drinking at a really young age and got pretty promiscuous. I never thought I was depressed because sometimes Id feel really happy and I was capable of that. I thought I was schizophrenic because sometimes I feel delusional or lately Ive started kind of seeing things or just being extremely terrified of seeing things. I even started to hear my dog choke the other day and when I yelled about it to my sister she said she heard nothing. I just learned that people who are bipolar have delusions and hallucinations so that part makes sense. I dont do drugs or cut myself anymore and after those things I tried really hard to clean up my act and managed to do very good in school and still am but I have absolutely no motivation and I get distracted SO EASILY like not even adderall will help me again I thought I had adhd but found out this is also a symptom of being bipolar. My mom will sometimes call me squirrel because Ill talk so fast and leap from topic to topic but other times I cant even talk to anyone because I get so irritated. I also have weird sleep patterns I cant go to bed even when Im tired and I feel the need to sleep for an incredibly long time most of the time. I also just hate myself I hate how I look so much despite constantly being praised for what I look like and whT I achieve. I dont know if Im just being paranoid or If I have general anxiety disorder or if Im bipolar... Im scared to reach out snd get help I dont know how. I get so hysterical and I cry so easily and I am so incredibly anxious. My family doctor is an asshole and my family would completely destroy me if they found out I was getting therapy when they were alerted by my teacher who found out I was cutting myself my mom was sad for about a minute and to this day 56yrs since they found out my dad will stay make fun of me for being depressed about nothing and cutting myself. None of them understand mental illness or why anyone with privilege would be mentally ill because they grew up in communist poland and had to escape and they were fine so I just feel stuck but I hate feeling like this I dont know what to do. Tldr i feel like i could be bipolar but im unsure I dont know what to do or how to get help. Family would kill me if they knew. ,Bipolar
50208,Little things Mornings are rough for me. So I pick my clothes the night before I have to wake up early so I dont have to think about it. This morning the pants I chose were covered in lint and I couldnt find the lint roller. I started freaking out. Felt like I was spiraling and even started crying because how u expected it was and its hard for me to make decisions. Now I want to have things ultra organized so I can try to stay in control of my enrionmsnt which can help me stay in control of my emotions. My bf witnessed my freak out and its just so embarrassing. He doesnt say anything he just lets me self soothe unless Im having a really hard episode. Hes still learning about my diagnosis.

46123,Have you ended a relationship while manic and later regretted it? My now ex fiance isn't diagnosed as bipolar so I may be completely off. In fact it never occurred to me to think that our relationship which would be going so well for months and the would have a sudden two week period of intensely angry fights was the result of bipolar disorder. We had broken up about 4 times in 3 years always for just a few days but this time I was tired of fighting his moods. On our last day together while doing a last sweep after packing up our apartment he casually mentioned that his mum is manic. He had never told me that before.I was really caught off guard by the breakup we had just gone to a romantic dinner the night before and his temper seemed out of nowhere so after giving him a few days to 'cool off' tried to fix it and that's when I found out about his new girlfriend. He was screwing her in the bed that We were still sharing at night Awful.Since we split I found out he's cycled through that girlfriend and now has 3 casual ones. He's bought a car a new computer 2 TVs. This despite being really tight on money generally and having a bunch of new expenses since we're not splitting them anymore I can't think of how he could possibly be affording this besides maxing out credit cards. He's deleted all his social media sent angry ranting texts to his friends cutting off their friendship. Right before the breakup he applied for a bunch of jobs in exotic places he's normally sort of boring about where he'll go and was coming up with two totally separate outofnowhere plans to start businesses in fields he's not skilled in. Now I'm wondering if he could be undiagnosed bipolar. It might explain the sudden promiscuity reckless spending maybe even the bursts of anger out of nowhere We're in our mid 30s so it would be late to be diagnosed.Now that I have this thought in my head I'm obsessed with the idea that maybe he is sick rather than cruel and that he might come down from his mania and want to reconcile. I could forgive everything with a genuine apology and obviously a promise to seek treatment. It's been about 3 months since we broke it off. We split our stuff moved to seperate places and after getting sick of getting angry texts out of he blue I blocked his number. I'm not going to contact him he'd have to come to me. I guess I'm not looking for redditers to armchair diagnose but wondering do people who dump someone during a manic spell come to regret it when they've come down? I'm wondering if my hope for reconciliation is actually plausible or if Im just grasping at straws?,Bipolar

I was having a particularly bad day while spending time with my boyfriend this past weekend. He recognized that I wasn't doing well without me having to say anything. I told him there wasn't anything he could do to help and that I just had to work through it. He kissed me on my forehead and told me he loves me unconditionally and that broke my bad spell. It took me a bit to fully pull out of it. If I can find someone who loves me there is hope for every single one of us. Please do not give up. Focus on yourself and someone will come along.

I used to have a ton of hobbies and interests now all I do is work and sleep. I still feel so much guilt and shame over what I did when I was psychotic. I became convinced my mother is evil who's perfectly normal and sent crazy emailsmessages to SO MANY people. I ruined a couple relationships I care about. I said so many disgusting things.How do you forgive yourself for being psychotic? Rationally I guess it wasn't my fault but it really feels like I thought my way to this point.

46774,How do I ask for forgiveness? I m34 had been treating what I thought was just depression for years. I had a long hypomania then crashed into depression hard. I got paranoid and delusional and asked some hurtful questions to my girlfriend at the time. She was really hurt and iced me out. I spiraled and was suicidal. I was coherent just enough and I made an emergency doctor appointment and was diagnosed bipolar. She ended up talking to me 5 days later. I tried to explain the diagnosis. she left me officially. Its been 3 weeks and I finaly am starting to feel stable. I don't know how to explain or ask for forgiveness. I can't make her take me back. I just wish there was a way to Express that it wasn't really me. It doenst feel like it was me. I feel sick that i hurt her and in my right mind would have never done that. I am trying so hard to be well but how do I show her? I am desperately in love with her. I am at a loss. Maybe I can't. If i can't how can I go on knowing that any setback in treatment can ruin everything and drive everyone away in seconds?,Bipolar
46290,Probably the most ridiculous way of fighting my negative thoughts First off I've been a Queen fan since my early childhood. I probably knew all the lyrics to Bohemian Rhapsody by four or five. I was as much of a fan as any poor kid whose family couldn't afford a CD player and was limited to the radio and her parents cassette tapes could be. The movie was right up my alley.Anyways a pattern of my depressive episodes combined with my comorbids is the worse most negative loathsome thought patterns often about my physical appearance. To combat this I have given my attempts at more positive self talk the most flamboyant happy Freddie Mercury voice and wordings I can imagine. And it's working. Yeah it's really really weird and kinda stupid but until i can stand on my own two feet one of my childhood idols can ight the demons for me.,Bipolar

Was talking to my wife about how Ive been seeing multiples of 11 everywhere and she says someone gave me a book today and pulls out a book which has the subtitle the meaning of 111222333 and other number sequences I know this is a symptom and Im probably ramping up to being hypomanic but the cognitive difference between understanding that and my experience of actually seeing it and feeling like the universe is trying to tell me something is a real mind fuck.

46119,Went on 2mg Abilify exactly 7 days ago as of today. I've gained 7 pounds. I am a 32 year old woman who was RX'd Abilify 2mg last week and began taking it a week ago today. I take it with 30mg lexapro which i've taken for several years with no weight gain at all.I am naturally very thin and always have been under weight. I have never had to worry about my weight...until now being on an AAP. I don't even own a scale and borrowed my roommate's today to find out my weight today and last week. The day I began the meds 7 days ago I was 117lbs and am now 124.5. I am still within the healthy benchmark for my height at 5'6. However given that it's only been a week and its 7 pounds that's a lot isn't it? I am excited to be a bit curvier and filled out but I worry about how unhealthy this rapid increase could be as diabetes runs in my family and I worry this medication will affect my health and metabolism negatively.This now is the ultimate incentive to exercise as i was infrequent and eat few caloriescarbs than before. I used to be someone who could eat anything and be rail thin. I'm hoping the effects of Abilify will out weigh the bad. I found that on day 5 of taking it which was this Monday was the first day I really felt like it was beginning to make me feel better. So far I find myself in a happier mood and my coworkers today told me I seem happier and asked me if something good or different happened. I didn't have an answer! I am now not scowling or irritable like I was. I am able to smile at people in my building now at work when I wasn't able to before.I'm curious to find out from other women what their weight gain has been like on Abilify. Were you able to control your weight eventually while still taking it? Or did you have to stop taking it in order to loose weight? Has anyone been able to loose weight after stopping it?,Bipolar

50044,questions about ultra rapid cyclingswitchingmixed states So I've been cycling since beginning of december before it was switching back and forth around every 5 days with about 12 hours of euthymia between the upgtdown switch and none in the downgtup switch but since some time in early feb it's more like switching every 2134 hours usually 2124 but sometimes a cycle gets a bonus half day added to it and this is with little or no break in between sides.Now this is where my question comes in I started on latuda 20 in early feb which seemed to work for like 3 days a week in then stop. Then Feb 22 I got upped to 40 as well as wellbutrin being doubled from 150300 oO. Now since last week almost exactly 2 weeks after upping the two the pattern has started doing something extra weird....Now instead of just going updownupdown like it was before there's a day break between the solid up and down ... and it's not euthymia it's like a funky mixed thing going on where it rapidly switches back and forth between lighter versions of both sides with each side ranging anywhere from a couple minutes to an hour. Then it switches into a 'full state' for a day to continue the cycle usually it goes in order but it doesn't always.So my question is ... I really can't understand exactly what this means ... does this mean it's getting better or worse? I'm trying to figure out if maybe the med changes are in the right direction or if this is actually worsening ... in some ways I'd say better since the number of 'full' cycles is technically slowed a little but for more obvious reasons it may be worse. Also these bouncy days are pretty obnoxious when it comes to doing things like work because I can't actually maintain a flow since it keeps changing on me.Has anyone had any sorta situation like this before? Do you think this is a path toward better or is it actually getting worse? I would think a question like that would be obvious but ... it isn't for this oO,Bipolar

I feel a lack of feeling sometimes I feel like Im completely empty inside. the problem is I dont feel this way only when Im depressed I also feel empty when Im happy and life is good. I kinda feel like I feel less empty when Im depressed because I feel sadness anger depression. I can at least cry and feel things even if its are not particularly pleasures feelings. On the other hand when Im stable I dont feel anything.I have a few theories 1. When Im depressed I am in contact with my feelings Im completely focused on whats happening inside of me instead of outside of me 2. When Im happy Im not in contact if my feelings I get my happiness from external factor in contrast of when Im depressed I get my sadness from internal factors. So maybe when Im stable Im not in contact with whats inside me.Honestly Im not sure if Im even close to the answer so please give me some advice especially if u been through this.

45550,My Checkup Was A Success Long Post The background story Since I was diagnosed over 10 years ago I've needed continuousongoing treatment and consultation. Changing dosages trying new medication talking through the most current triggers how to recognize avoid cope and foster healthy decisions. Gone through 4 doctors... when I was able to get an appointment and afford the treatment. I've gone some years withdrawing some entirely unmedicated new medication lower dosehigher dose self medicating at times. Having bipolar is truly debilitating and scary. Emotional Mood symptom wise last year was not as intense as I've experienced before. But last year was indeed the shittiest fucking year I have lived through in my entire life thus far. I won't list everything that was shitty. You guys know last year was horrible. My Mom almost dying before her liver transplant probably topped my list though. And my bipolar mania has decided to manifest entirely through my secondary symptoms of OCD. Chronic anxiety has taken over my usual depression and has crash landed directly on one main symptom. Self Excoriationdermatillomaniacompulsive skin picking.httpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiExcoriationdisorder No exaggeration I look like the picture in that Wikipedia link just add breasts and some curves. I'm not looking for advice or guidance. I've been receiving the professional version steadily over a year and a half now. I just know that CSP is not common in this sub is often not associated with bipolar and is still considered co morbid along with symptoms of OCD.The point of my post. I saw my psychiatrist today. And he agreed that I have had very significant improvements since I last saw him. My episodes have been less frequent less intense and my depression has also eased up. My mania still keeps me awake throughout the week I get 34 hrs sleep at a time around 47am. and I literally sleep all weekend. But my job hasn't been suffering I've made three trips from the west coast to Texas for some extremely intense circumstances I've lost 30lbs and reduced my skin picking from my legs and lower arms to just my upper arms back and face although my face has had dramatic improvements as well. My checkup Achievement For the first time since I can remember my doctor isn't changing my medication and has said that I don't need to schedule a follow up appointment at this time. I will continue to have a steady supply of my personal med cocktail without worrying about running out. I'm under no obligation to pay for schedule drive to or stress about coordinating my life around another psych appointment until I feel it's necessary.TLDR Some yearssome decades are worse than others. If you can't remember the last time you caught a break don't give up. We all deserve peace and stability. Today was my day.,Bipolar

45817,Has anyone here had any experience with legally taking time off high school? Hello everyone! I'm a high school student who was a month ago diagnosed with Bipolar II. I'd been having depressive episodes for about a year and a month and a half ago started experiencing manic episodes as well which was the reason why I decided to see a doctor. I'm still very early in my treatment don't yet have a psychiatrist and won't for another month or two thanks American health insurance and I've been having a really hard time coping. I've always been a very high achieving student getting straight A's every semester and doing my best not to miss school. This year however has been different. Due to my Bipolar Disorder I've now missed a month of school have had to drop 3 classes and I really don't know what to do at this point. My mental health takes top priority so I am certainly not planning on sacrificing my health and safety for school. I'm feeling really hopeless and lost and balancing school work and my illness just isn't possible anymore. I plan on going to college next year but I'm afraid that my absences and now failing grades are going to affect my ability to get scholarships. I really just need to take this year off without droppingout so I can get the help I need. I was wondering if anyone here has any advice or similar experiences. I live in New York in case that matters. Sorry for the wall of text.,Bipolar
50103,Feeling like giving up. Trigger warningabusesuicidalThis is really just a rant since I have no one to talk to and I'm tired of emotion dumping on the couple friends i have left. It's been awhile since I've hit depression this hard. At one point I had a car a full time job my own place a boyfriend and friends. I sold my car last year during mania. I struggle to find a job that works for me or i dont run away from so I have very little money now. I'm looking for work again. I live at home with family and now my abusiveerratic alcoholic brother has moved in. I'm scared for my safety but I have no where else to go. Last year I got a peace order on him out of fear and didn't have to worry about him coming by but my family lashed out on me for it and threatened to put me out if I didnt take it off. My mom let's me use her extra car that she told me she'd give me but changes her mind every other week or when shes angry. Shes let me live with her and help out with the house for some years not but shes tired of me and how I cant ever finish what I start. Or how I hyperfixate on things but haven't made any money. She gets verbally and emotionally abusive towards me and in the past when this happens I leave but now I have no where to. This week I've been taking the car and doing everything I can to make some progress. I even made an appointment with a new therapist and filled out job applications. I'm not on medication or anything. Yesterday it hit me I've been crying on and off now since last night. I feel helpless and alone. My brother moving in is the last of all I can take. I feel like I put up a solid fight but idk what I'm pushing for now. I've literally ruined my life.,Bipolar
46252,Went to dinner and DIDN'T do something stupid. So me and my boyfriend went to dinner had a good time finishing up I need to hit the restroom. As I'm getting out I notice the manager of the restaurant was in there using the facilities. He had stopped by our table and chatted a bit just a bit ago so I got the idea in my head to offer him a blowjob. It was just me and him locking stalls... Fuck. It was so tempting. BUT I DIDN'T. So. I'm happy about that. I took my medication I'm consistent with it and I know for a fact I'm not manic right now but god damn! If I wasn't on my medication I know I would have had a much much harder time tonight resisting that temptation to proposition him.,Bipolar
49817,About to be out of meds I'm not very smart and I figured you guys would know. I live in the US and I recently moved to a new state 6 months ago never got in contact with a new doctor. I can call around tomorrow but I assume it'll take me a long time to get in anywhere. I only have two doses of my seroquel left. My old one from the other state made it clear last time that he would not refill it again. I'm fucking stupid and this is all my own fault. Do I have any options except go off everything and just cope with it until an appointment? I looked it up and urgent care clinics can't help me with this apparently.,Bipolar
49510,How do I stop obsessing over someone its Getting bad I dated a girl 5 months ago for only 5 dates but things got really intense then she left me for someone else. Im so desperately trying to let it go cuz it be best for both of us but when I fall for someone its not something I can let go as much as I try. I have a full and enriching life Ive been really trying to dive into my activities full ass but as soon as I have a second to myself I spiral.I keep texting her late at night basically crying to her how much I miss her and how much she meant to me. Im surprised she hasnt blocked me or told me to get over it cuz at this point I hate to say it Im getting to the point Im obsessive. I dont stalk her at all I just think about her all day and I can hardly focus at work. I dont really drink but Ive been drinking alone at night I think about relapsing on drugs cuz I just dont want to feel anymore but fucking fentanyl in my DOC ruins it. I have abandonment issues but no amount of meds progres in life friends or therapy has helped only when I date someone I feel whole and I think if someone stuck around I could realize not everyones gonna leave me in 2 seconds but I have yet to have any evidence its not like that.Pls help I feel pathetic Im just hurting so bad. Ive had some really bad shit happen in my life but Id endure any of that if somehow that would get her back,Bipolar
49963,SCARED TO BE A PARENT This is me venting? Help any advice helps!Ive been diagnosed with BD type 1 for two years and when I got diagnosed it made so many things from my childhood make sense.I was always so emotional and dramatic and known as being a cry baby basically my entire life. To be completely honest I truly think Ive always been bipolar genetically not necessarily an environmental effectalthough my environment didnt help but cause more spark to the fire Anyway Im 27 now and Ive decided to discontinue birth control. I currently take the pill and have the nexplanon. The combination of the two seemed to help for about five months but since having the nexplanon I have gained so much weight and have become more noticeably irritable. My episodes are more drastic and scare not only myself but others around me. Along with that my depression has gotten worse and pet of that is because of the weight of gainedit makes me so mad. Ive tried dieting and exercising extensively. I have been told that a k eto diet helps manage symptoms of BDnot sure how true tha is. But I did do the diet for about two months and I dropped weight quick and get on top of the world. Thinking back on it now idk if that top of the world feeling was me having an episode.I few like my BD has been managed quite well but of course I struggle day to day. Everyone here knows how dark bad days can be you know how it can be. Its scary as fuck! I want to be healthier with minimal medication and I feel like that means no more birth control. Im hoping it helps me lose weight and decrease my depression. I also want to start a family but it worries me that my children could possibly have BD like me. No one is immune to pain and suffering but man having a mental diagnosis sure makes things a hell of a lot harder. Edit the only reason Ive taken birth control is because my cycle is extremely irregular. Sometimes I have it every day for months at a time to having it very painfully for a day or two. All birth control Ive used has helped for about two months until it seems to have no effect on my body. The last birth control I was using was the pill along with the nexplanon. The combination of the two seemed to help for about five months.,Bipolar
46439,Does anyone feel like they get way too overly attached to their partnersomeone theyre seeing? I handle break ups and unexpected rejection really badly.When I broke up with my ex last year I didnt really care and then 3 months after i was crying for like 2 months about it.I stayed over for one night with someone whod had a crush on me for 3 years the next morning she says she doesnt feel the same way anymore and we should probably never meet again.This past weekend I had a girl Id been video chatting for a while take a 4 hour train ride and stay over for the weekend. It was amazing having her there but it was constantly on my mind that soon she wouldnt be there anymore. I feel like my feelings come way too fast and abnormally and its really making me depressed. Was diagnosed with bp2 a couple of weeks ago and waiting to start meds.,Bipolar

I get they arent a cure all and Id be much worse off meds but whats the point if I still cant function in life??

46656,The Calm I have Bipolar 2.After a month of isolation and depression I went out with my friends last night and had a great time. I went home tired and slept the whole day. I woke up exhausted but the racing thoughts and irritability are gone. My mind is blank and surprisingly calm. I'm actually panicking a bit because at this point I don't know what's happening. There are no more excessive intrusive thoughts or those crazy ideas just really calm. I feel alright but I still think of suicide. I think what scares me a bit is that I experience this before a big mood swing. Am I okay? ,Bipolar

I grew up with a toxic family was depressed on and off since I was a kid lifelong ED trauma bipolar 2 medinduced psychosis MASSIVE episode that lasted 2 years... now I've been stable for over a year and it is like nothing I ever dreamed of.

It's a long haul but it's possible.I'm not cured and I'm still dealing with some shit. I probably always will be. But I think I can actually do this.

46421,I feel like killing myself but I might as well see Into the SpiderVerse first. I'm in a really dark place right now. I think I've been in a funky little depressive episode for a while now. I've been cancelling my therapy appointments because I have too much anxiety to talk about my problems but then as a drawback I don't get to talk about my problems. Now I actively want to die instead of just passively. Last night I stood outside in the cold until my fingers hurt so much I cried that wasn't the goal the goal was fresh air but that's what ended up happening.I'm thinking the most likely outcome is that getting out of the house for longer than 30 minutes for the first time in two weeks will improve my mood enough that I'll find some other reason to live past that. But right now all I've got figured out is I'm going to see the movie before I do any dangerous impulsive thing. Sound good?,Bipolar

One weird thing I have noticed is if I take the Saphris right before putting my cpap mask on the Saphris doesnt seem to work as well. I think its because the air from the machine dries out my throat and because the med is sublingual it does not dissolve correctly. Has anyone else noticed this?,Bipolar

I feel like I could be happysad either way. I just started listening to an audio book about trying to decide about kids and I had to turn it off because it was making me cry.

50175,Coworker talks down to me about mental health I started taking a mood stabilizer and an antipsychotic after being diagnosed with bipolar type II earlier last year. It took a lot to admit there was an issue and to seek a psychiatrist. I was proud of the progress I made this last year. I felt great until a coworker made me feel like shit and that my progress meant nothingI have a coworker that is much older than me he frequently talks down to me in front of the entire team and has the attitude that his opinion is gospel no matter the circumstances. Im two years out of college with limited experience so I approached him about my frustration and how I can improve. He got very defensive and denied any part in this. Instead of talking it through with me he monologued about mental health and seeking a therapist to talk about my frustrations at work insteadI sat there and listened to him monologue trying to act like it was fine but damn did it hurt to be talked down to about my mental health. I never told anyone about my diagnosis medication or treatment. I always tried to prevent my bipolar disorder from affecting my job performance at all either the main issues were from how it affected my life outside of work. Im seeking a new job now but has anyone had experiences like this with coworkers?,Bipolar
46948,I keep convincing myself that I don't have bipolar. Hi reddit. To preface I'm 21 got diagnosed with BP1 in November of 2017 have been medicated since February 2018 and started going to a talk therapist last June. Despite having experienced detrimental manic episodes within the past year severing relationships abruptly quitting a job I needed etc I can't help but think that I don't actually have bipolar. It's probably because the meds are working and helping but regardless of that fact I can't shake it and start to convince myself that I don't really need them. In therapy I've learned a bunch about my habits and childhood issues but we don't really discuss things through the lens of having bipolar specifically. My mind keeps coming to the conclusion that all of my actions in the past have come from a sound mind and that I'm using mental illness as a scapegoat of some sort.. or something. Sorry. This is a rambling post. But does anyone else struggle with this or something similar? TLDR I have bipolar but keep thinking that I don't wat do now,Bipolar
50209,Disassociation Derealization I was wondering if you guys had any derealization at all. I see it as feeling like Im in a dream being extremely detacheddisconnected to people and things around me to the point where it seems like the crowds of people around me are just part of a random setting Im in everything around me is blurred and that type of stuff.

Im doing my own research now but I just started unpacking this after my therapist pointed it out.,Bipolar
50196,Ramble about new diagnosis I finally got diagnosed after 10 years of me having breakdowns and making GP appointments and desperately asking doctors to tell me whats wrong with me.It took a mental health nurse to see something was really wrong and she got my seen by a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with unspecified bipolar and Ive now also been referred for an ADHD assessment. I dont feel any better though. Well of course not nothing has actually changed. I have been taking Lamictal but not feeling any positive effects yet. I had been told for years its depression anxiety and one doctor said it sounded hormonal. I thought that I would get better. I thought that I would recover and live a healthy normal life. I feel like I have to mourn the idea of this now. Im not getting much help behind this diagnosis. They say because Ive never been hospitalised and I manage to hold down a job and maintain relationships I dont need it. I get it but it hurts. I feel invalidated confused and alone.I managed to get myself a good job at a company I could have only dreamed of working for. I am fucking it up though. I do nothing most days. Im so consumed by whats going on in my head whether its good or bad. Im going to have to go back to a less demanding job which breaks my heart and I feel if leave it will trigger an episode. Im scared Ill impulsively quit one day too like my last 4 jobs. Maybe Ill get fired first anyway. I have an amazing support system and have cut off anyone who wasnt good for me. Im also in a loving relationship with someone I want to spend the rest of my life with. I have to fight thoughts about sabotaging these relationships though. Theyre so annoying I tell myself but actually Im just irritable and they really care about me which can be hard to believe.Despite everything appearing good to others I am so chaotic. Ive stopped pretending now when people ask me if Im okay. I tell them no I feel crazy. Everyone tells me I need a routine but it is impossible. My life on paper is great and in reality it is too to be honest. Its boring though. Ive gone sober too. I feel ungrateful almost. I am the problem and I am losing my mind. I feel like Ive been fighting the crazy in me for years but Im exhausted and I dont want to anymore. Im sick of doing the right things and whats good for me. This diagnosis has brought up some scary thoughts like now my insane moods are justified. I dont need to hold back anymore. I also then think though if Ive been able to keep complete madness at bay then I guess Im actually not that unwell. I just feel like a prisoner of my own mind.,Bipolar

Empty mania which Im currently in in case this is illegible is like Im floating and everythings hilarious and but I also begin to dissociate and question whether Im realanything around me is real.Full mania is like my body is too heavy and too alive and Im too irritable to socialize with most people without snapping at them and its almost like my body is too big for my skin if that makes sense and I feel everyones eyes staring into my toobig body.Again maybe thats just me but its helped me be able to better track my moods like this.,Bipolar

I just got denied life insurance I was reluctant to have my doc notes turned over because I feel like it is a violation of privacy but I knew I would be denied if I did not. I understand why they need that information because they are basically bookies trying to set the odds on if you are going to be alive in 20 years. Well it is another tough pill to swallow that this is jus the way it is. This is also the first time my bp has been cited to outright deny something. I get it I understand how ever I have a family I am concerned about if an accident or something happens. I am sure I am not the first to go through this and this is the only place I think I can find good answers.,Bipolar
46377,feeling down trigger warning talks about grief and mourningHi everyone! I thought I'd check in though I haven't been all that active in this community recently. By all accounts I'm doing pretty well I'm successful in my job and have settled into the city I've moved to for about a year. Starting to form some social connections and am in therapy. It's been 1 year since my last hospital visit and my symptoms are really going down. I also started following one of my passions and started writing a book about my mental health experiences.what I want to chat about is how you all keep it together when life throws you some shitty stuff? My grandma passed away recently and my family is still dealing with stuff about her passing. We were very close and I hadn't seen her in about a year since I live on the other side of the country. I ended up not going to the funeral but shared some memories that my family read. I won't get into details here but we may also sell one of her properties that was very meaningful to me growing up. Her passing also caused some tension in our family which I'm not personally involved in but still feels stressful.Then totally out of the blue another person I didn't know well but who worked with me also passed away. I can't help feeling regret about not talking to this person more and wish that I had spent more time to do that. Actually I'm feeling that about my grandma as well. Looking for any suggestions about how to keep it positive when you're dealing with tough stuff like this? I feel a lot of regret and sadness about not spending more time with these people. I also feel a little bit of disillusionment and a little hopeless just generally thinking about how our time on earth is limited. It's also wintertime so I think that's contributing too. Has anyone been dealing with anything similar or gotten through something like this?,Bipolar

While this is great and all but I'm afraid of what'll happen between getting my meds. Just this last day I've been having horrible mood swings getting so angry and cold. I've been having more and more thoughts about hurting myself and others. The hurting others bit is what's scaring me the most.

Left the doctor today telling me I have severe depression and bipolar 1 disorder Ah honestly feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders so I can hopefully acknowledge the feelings I have going forward and hopefully get the help I need to feel like myself. So she tried putting me on medication but I personally feel like the diagnoses was rushed and theres more than just what she asked me about.

I quit smoking weed and didnt sleep for 2 weeks and went on a spiritual powwow and got arrested for breaking and entering. It was at this point I realized I was not on a mission from God and then it got really scary because I went into psychosis while I was in the jail. And I got pepper sprayed so I was laying on the floor choking and having no idea what was going on. But luckily I didnt die and now I know that I need latuda,Bipolar

45403,Husband has just about blocked me out and refuses to deal with my mental health issues In some ways I can't blame him but I need someone. Right now I have a good friend to talk to but she really just doesn't get it. She never saw the bad years. My husband lived them.I have been married almost 12 years. I know that I've been working hard to act better and my actions have been consistently much more thought out and I've been MUCH less volatile. I can let things go that I would have never been able to before. The other night my really stressed out husband he went back to college and has just been grumpy the whole time flew off the handle at me. Over something I said about Mexican CocaCola. Anyway I just let him vent as he said things like You just make me want to hate you. And he referred to the last time I was in the hospital as the Smlybright show. making everything about me. He immediately referred to how selfish I am which I really haven't been in a long time. This isn't even really him! I least I hope he hasn't turned into this guy!I WAS selfish a long time ago. I was mean a long time ago I was way too hypersexual a long time ago. And he has dealt with all of it. But he can't ever forgive me for anything. He has stopped being there when I really need him because he has just started blocking me out. He doesn't want to deal with me. I cry in private. I contemplate leaving or dying in private. I can't talk to him about these things anymore because we've had this conversation 100 times and you never remember what I tell you anyway and I have my own problems to deal with and I know how you feel because I'm depressed and have problems with that and I still am moving forward because somebody has take care of this family we don't have kids. He means the pets. Which I definitely help with. We haven't had sex in about a year. For years prior I felt like he just did it to get his obligatory sex in for the quarter. When we got married we had sex all the time and then I wanted it all the time and he didn't anymore. Then he says he felt like I was using him. Maybe I was. I would actually throw fits about it. Crying screaming fits. Embarrassing but I'm being honest in this post.Medicine has made me gain a lot of weight. He says it's not me. It's that he needs to feel like I am a safe place mentally physically and emotionally. I still wonder if it's just my body. But I take my medicine because it works.He says I get worse every year but when I really look at myself I know I'm doing better in a lot of really important ways. My relationships with other people not so much my husband right now have improved tremendously. I am not working anymore well some part time but not a lot but I'm slowly becoming more productive and balancing my functionality with my anxiety and the pressure it makes me feel. I bring in the money because I was medically retired from the military.I think sometimes it's how you look at your illness. You can only really judge your own level of the illness affecting your life because you are the only one inside your brain. It's easy to forget the good times when we are feeling low. Last time I had some pretty bad depression I honestly couldn't think of any reason to keep going. I started to end things. But at the critical moment I just had this strong feeling that I was checking out FOREVER. No more good days OR bad days and that I could always off myself if I wanted to so I'd live another day and reevaluate later. And things got better. And then worse and then better. Any advice on any of this would be great. Sometimes I feel like I don't even like him anymore. A lot of times I feel like I love the old him but not this guy who at one time was always there and now refuses to deal with me.,Bipolar
46577,Like what the fuck I can't fucking do anything like a normal person. I got into a huge fight with my parents today because I can't take 4 college classes at once. Realistically I can only take 2 because of my stupid high stress levels. My mom was telling me that when she's stressed she WALKS AROUND HER FLOOR ONCE. No Mom you being stressed out teaching sixth grade isn't the fucking same and I've heard plenty of anxiety coping strategies you aren't going to fucking fix me by telling me to take a walk. And it super doesn't help when you tell me that I have a right to be upset. No fucking shit you do but that doesn't mean that you get to overrride any feelings I have and tell me that I don't really understand my own emotions and that your life is so much harder than mine. EVERYTHING ends up being about her feelings and how she has a right to feel stuff. No one is trying to take that from her all I trying to fucking do is express what's wrong with me. When I fucking say that I'm dropping a few classes no matter what their input is my mom immediately takes that and says obviously you don't care about me or my feelings! No mom that's fucking not what I said I said I need to reduce my course load because of my fucking mental illness and I said that whatever your opinion on this one fucking thing is won't change the outcome. Then she goes on about how I'm so selfish and never think about her and how my plan for life is shit and how I just need to do whatever she tells me to have a real life. FUCK YOU and you trying to explain to me that I'm just getting in my own way and how I just need to commit to something and everything will be okay. YOU TEACHING SIXTH GRADE DOESN'T MEAN YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH. I'm so tired of her always thinking she knows exactely how to fix me and that it's so fucking easy to overcome this and just act like normal. Stupid fucking rant over.,Bipolar
49750,I think I was misdiagnosed Okay so 2 years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and at the time I was like this doesn't sound right but I guess I'll go with it. I was put on lamotrigene after a 20 minute appointment with my psychiatrist where with some vague descriptions of what my highs and lows were he decided it was a solid diagnosis. But the thing is he never asked for specifics about what they were like just generally if I experienced them.The highs of my 'mania' would last about 13 months at a time and usually consisted of me being very active and upbeat but I never exactly had any risky behaviors associated with it. I've never had periods of hypersexuality or completely upended my life on a whim or anything extreme like that. I can get irritable and my impulse control has never been great but I've never felt like my thoughts were racing or anything like that. Probably the most 'extreme' thing I've ever done was to move to a different state after a 5 year relationship that I felt trapped in ended. I just needed a fresh start from it and I got that before moving back home with a better perspective albeit in the middle of a depressive episode.In fact the only really concerning thing I ever had going on were intense periods of depression also lasting between 1 and 3 months at a time. I would have a hard time getting myself motivated to do basic tasks and my interest in things I enjoyed waned during those times to pretty much nothing. Being put on meds I was just coming out of a long funk and after starting lamotrigene it never really felt like that funk ended. I still have problems motivating myself to do basic things even 2 years in and I constantly feel like I'm lagging and forcing myself to do everything and I hate it. During my up periods I used to actually workout and be active and would write and take my son to the park and be an active and eager participant in family activities. But since being medicated I don't have any of that. I'm gaining weight and have zero motivation to do anything about it despite being miserable because of it being an active parent feels like a chore and I can't write to save my life. I feel like I'm a totally different person and I don't want to be this way anymore. I think I might have been misdiagnosed but idk how to broach this with my psychiatrist I feel like he barely listens to me. If anything my symptoms are much closer to that of ADHD or MDD just applying my lived experiences to them but when I tried to bring up ADHD he kind of handwaved it away saying that adult ADHD was difficult to diagnose and left it there. I'm not sure how to bring this up with him and was hoping some people here might be able to give me some tips on how to do that? Should I get a 2nd opinion from another psychiatrist? I just want to stop feeling this way.,Bipolar
47005,Everyone I just made this account recently for the sole purpose of helping people who need it. I want everyone out there to know that sometimes people just need somone to have a difficult conversation with. Talking out your feelings with someone who will actually hear you and not just wait for their turn to talk can do so much for your mental health. I know that not everyone has that relationship with someone or can afford therapy I know I didn't and couldn't so I want to tell you that if you feel like you need someone to listen I will do it. Send me a message here and I will respond as soon as I can. I promise. Everyone deserves to be heard and no one should feel shame for who they are and what they feel,Bipolar

49501,I got a stern reminder that being stable doesnt mean I am cured I recently had to lower my lithium under doctor supervision because my lithium level was too high. I started to notice that I felt less numb. I felt butterflies in my stomach and a warm fuzzy happy for the first time since I was a teenager. It was intoxicating. So I thought to myself maybe I dont need my lithium anymore. I never tried stopping it completely after ECT. This was a bad planFor the last few days I felt something I hadnt felt in a long time too. The overwhelming depression self hatred and urge to harm myself. It was terrifying. And I found I was completely out of practice in suppressing those feelings. Back on my lithium I am the first one to advocate taking your pills so I feel like a hypocrite. I have been reminded that deep in my mind bipolar is still there and still capable of destroying me. It was humbling terrifying and discouraging all at the same time. Today I mourn the fact that I will never be able to fully feel emotions and will always have to be sedated to some degree. I shouldnt complain because at least I have stability. But that taste of what life is really supposed to feel like and knowing I will never have it has left me in a bad way. I feel ungrateful for the stability I have and greedy for the way I used to feel before getting sick. I feel here is the only place where people will understand what Im going through. sincerely a very tired bipolar warrior,Bipolar

46936,My experience with tramadol This past week I was prescribed 8 tablets of tramadol for an unrelated posttreatment painkiller and I felt completely different. Its hard to explain but basically even during arguments and other stressful situations that unsettle me I was able to stay calm and focused. I felt enough of the anger emotion that I knew I was angry but my brain was calm enough to accept the anger and be passive while yet acknowledging it. I was also productive and in great spirits which seems to be the norm on this opioid.Ive never been diagnosed and Ive always lied on depression quizzes at the hospital but the truth is a couple weeks ago it hit me that my mood swings and depression might not be normal.I realized that sometimes I am completely happy and good to the point of being TOO happy. I will often hyperorganize my house deep clean or workout every single day... basically checked off every symptom of a mania. During these times I paintwrite exercise I eat and cook hell I even tackle projects outside and have a hard time falling asleep for being too excited with my projects. Ive also had bad instances with alcohol during these times from a feeling of cockiness and recklessness where I have acted out in ways I am ashamed of.As for the depression it comes on as low and long as it can be. I sleep on the couch during the day lose weight and am constantly weepy or angry. I do not like to work on anything much less have the energy to deep clean or create. These mood swings as Ive always called them come in bouts of weeks sometimes months and occasionally like I mentioned as a result of an argument or something else incredibly stupid. This is having a toll on my marriage and family and I am curious as to medications having any similar effect on me as tramadol which I read up on and completely agreed with the following In fact one of the reason people like taking Tramadol is because for some people it works as an antidepressant producing euphoria or energy unlike other opioids which tend to make people drowsy. This has led it being used recreationally while people still go to work or live their daily lives. blog.iodine.comI am obviously not going to get this prescription refilled and dont need the cautions because like I said I read up and completely understand the danger of taking opioids as anything other than a TEMPORARY strong painkiller.TLDR Im 24f hesitant to take the first step in getting diagnosed or treated for what I suspect is Bipolar 1 Disorder. Had a good experience with an unrelated painkiller and would like to hear from people who selfdiagnosed and are now on treatments or anyone who can relate to my experience. ,Bipolar

He now holds a lot of resentment towards the field in general. ampx200BI have Bipolar II. I have suffered for years and years. No medications work though I did have great luck with dTMS. A full year of no depression and no suicidal thoughts. I thought I was in heaven I swear. ampx200BBut that's all worn off now. I'm taking my medicine I'm trying my hardest but it's just not working. I'm having full meltdowns nearly daily and it's only a matter of time before I need to commit myself again. This time last year I did a 10 day stint in the psych ward after a suicide attempt. And those feelings are back and so so strong. ampx200BMy SO keeps my medicine under lock and key luckily. But now ECT is on the table. He doesn't think the time off work is justified nor the cost. But he doesn't understand. I could die. And if I do attempt and it doesn't work the hospital bills for inpatient treatment are going to be far higher than the cost of ECT plus I would very likely lose my job.ampx200BHe says if this was cancer and I needed 6 weeks off work for chemo it would be a different story.

46873,Pot induced my mania is this the new normal? Is bipolar mania precipitated by marijuana use typically one off or a new normal in the cycle? Am I likely to experience fullblown mania without medication?Some backgroundAfter a period of minor depression I reverted to old habits and smoked some marijuana which caused my first manic episode. I spent some time in a psych ward and was given lithium and zyprexa which didn't fully suppress my manic state. After a couple months in hypomania I gave my zyprexa to someone else I'd med who couldn't afford them. I thought I'd be fine with just a week until my next refill. I was wrong and went manic totalled my car and ended up back in the psych ward. Now I'm dealing with the fallout from this event.I'm 26 and generally high functioning. I was an alcoholic for a few years and have been sober for about 4 years it runs in my family. I'd smoked pot before but not often because it would make me feel very anxious and make my thoughts race.Is this extreme episode of mania my new normal or is it likely a oneoff ? I'd never experienced them before. In fact I don't think I'd ever really experienced general hypomania before only excitement related to specific projects or areas of interest.I'm unable to find much online about this here's onegtClinicians agree that cannabis use can cause acute adverse mental effects that mimic psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.gt...gtCannabis abuse prior to development of bipolar disorder has a significant effect on firstepisode mania and on the course of the disease.

It really depressed me to find out that I did have bipolarity. I recently found out that my father also has bipolarity and coincidentally shares many of the same characteristics as mine. Is it normal for me to get angry when everyone calls me bipolar?,Bipolar

45897,Boyfriend 26m diagnosed bipolar when he was 10 but Im wary of his initial diagnosis. Hes going to go see someone to get reevaluated as soon as he gets insurance. TW Suicide The more I talk to my boyfriend about his past it seems like he was demonized for having any emotions as a child and his parents were emotionally abusive and neglectful. He acted out in elementary school and attempted suicide and was sent to a psych ward where he was diagnosed. Theyre not going to see that his parents were trash and used religion to mentally abuse him and shammed him for having normal human emotionsresponses to their behavior. In the year that Ive known him hes been severely depressed with racing thoughts. Hes like your typical person with severe major depression. He has thoughts of suicide almost constantly. He claims he felt normal when he moved out of his house and hes gotten worse since being back home. Can you go an entire year or two without mania with bipolar and only have depression? His description of mania is so hard to understand that Im unsure if thats just his normal mood of being pulled out of the depression or if its truly mania that hes describing. He said a happy event will trigger it and it might last 12 days. He also has anger issues with the depression. I know depression can make you agitated and so can mania. Can you have bipolar and not have manic episodes hardly ever? Like be depressed for a whole year with no indication of mania or hypomania? Im not certain how to identify mixed episodes but hes always depressed. I know he needs to go to a psychiatrist for an evaluation and treatment but its not an option at this exact moment due to financial issues so Im just trying to learn all that I can for right now. Im trying to get the money to take him as soon as I can. I just want to learn more about this stuff and more about him in the meantime. ,Bipolar
50070,Its been a little while since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type II I'm a young girl in her 5th year of medical school that was diagnosed 7 months ago and I feel like this disease it's almost ending with my dreams I've been having panic attacks and a lot of depression lately and some pairs of mine are bullying me now they treat me like there is something wrong with me. I'm paralyzed I don't know what to do I take all my medicines go to the therapist and all of those things but this is getting over me.I'm so tired of this...,Bipolar
49734,Well its been a good run boys but the doctor thinks its actually BPD lmao So I just recently had a new evaluation and the proctor is convinced that Ive been misdiagnosed. Which is extremely common with BPD and bipolar. But. Now Im struggling. I feel relieved but horrified. Not to say that bipolar is better than BPD or less bad but its just distressing to have a label stripped and replaced with another. If Im being honest Ive doubted my bipolar diagnosis for a long time now but somehow I feel like Im betraying my sense of community and self by feeling hopeful. Its like? Idk I guess it was easier to say its justBipolar because it became a cop out.It was easier to dismiss my explosive emotions and constant mood swings as just being bipolar symptoms. Because it meant that I could treat it with meds. And I tried so hard to act like the mood stabilizers help but They dont. I cycle through so many extremes on a daily basis. At my old psych all of this was dismissed and treated with anti psychotics that just make me feel sluggish and disinterested. It feels liberating to be listened to for once but I feel so? Lost. Like Ive just been stripped of the identity Ive been cultivating for years. Its weird. It feels like I owe everyone an update. Like Ive got to go on an Ive got BPD! Tour so that no one hates me or accuses me of faking a disorder. Ugh. Idk man. Feeling liberated but also scared. Can I stay in this sub lmao? Im so comfy here,Bipolar

46157,crosspost from advice I'm at a crossroads with career due to mental illness I'm 26 I do tier 1amp2 tech support and other IT tasks at a decently sized fortune company. I've been diagnosed with bipolar for 6 years. Anxiety and previously depression for 15I've been having one of the worst depressed episodes in years. We're going on 5 months now. Typically when I have an episode and I'm working the either the collateral damage from the mania or stagnancy from the depression lead to me losing my job. But with this one I have short term disability insurance and FMLA so my job is protected. I'm at home thinking about what I want to do with my life and if the life I lead could be contributing to the stress I feel. I went to high school for writing and was a college drop out for film. I have a passion for the arts a talent for the science and an interest in a lot of other fields. And surmountable debt from my previous studies.Part of me knows the reasonable thing would be to go back to work but it feels like a big ol wall is blocking me.The tricky thing is that the disease makes you feel like moving and making changes and starting new projects and idk if thats what that really is. I could use some outside insightI'm trying to figure out if it makes sense to go back to school and apply for disabilityscholarshipsect or continue down the technology path.,Bipolar
49760,Had a terrifying episode last night Drank 3 beers. Decided that tonight was the night that I wanted to be confrontational with my partner. It escalated into me becoming fully psychotic. Disassociating. Walking into the water behind our house. Losing my phone there. I'm afraid of who Ive become. It's only been this bad about 2 times before. Im consumed with guilt. I had two kids who heard me losing it. I'm devastated. Anxious. My partner was able to calm me down towards the end. But at that point the doom was full throttle. The sinking. Drowning. Feeling incredibly out of place just by existing. Woke up those morning feeling like I'd been hit by a train. My eyes were so sore and bloodshot from crying for hours on end.I don't know what to do anymore. .how do you come back from that? My kids do not know I'm bipolar but they are old enough I think to know 12amp14?I'm too ashamed to tell them. If anyone is in a similar place please feel free to share what keeps you going.,Bipolar
45532,Bad inpatient stories? Ive been hospitalized twice as a teenager in a youth ward and twice as an adult. The last time was at Fairfax Behavioral Hospital in Kirkland WA and it was abusive as hell. Everything about why I was there was horribly exaggerated and they lied about me when I went to court so I got legally committed to two weeks unless a doctor signed me out. They literally said because I took so long with the strip search because Ive been raped quite a few times but you know they didnt mention that part that I couldnt handle interacting with anyone right now and I was still obviously in an extreme crisis and I might injure someone else. I wasnt even in an episode lmao I was fine after two days of being there and Ive never been a violent person? But go off I guess. A lot of other shitty things happened and they got my hopes up and said I could leave one day but then they were like nah youre gonna stay for another few days for no reason I told them its illegal to hold me when Im not in a crisis and they were like haha ok try to leave then. When it was my day to leave my case worker lost necessary paperwork and then went on a two hour lunch and my psychiatrist didnt have time to write my prescriptions. I ended up leaving the facility at 7pm when my exit time was 230pm.Not trying to bring up bad memories but Im curious to know if its more common to have extremely negative experiences rather than positive ones.So does anyone have any super shitty inpatient experiences?Also where is the facility located?

46665,To be bipolar amp legally recognized as disabled or not pros amp cons? I am pretty stable on meds right now and could probably pass as not having a disability. The exception is if I need to take time off in the future for breakout episodes that would put me over my vacationsick day allowance. In that case I assume I need to use ADA accommodations. I was talking with my pdoc the other day and I asked about the national parks access pass for people with disabilities and she said something along the lines of I need to decide if I want to be considered legally disabled because that could bite me in the butt one day. I know on my job licensing application it asks if I have any conditions that affect my ability to practice veterinary medicine. I said no because I don't think that this disorder will affect my medical judgement. Anyway I will take time off before it gets to that point. But at the same time I might need to take more time off than I have available in my contract if I have breakout episodes. But there is already an example of this potential problem.Does anyone know the pros and cons of legally having a disability in the context of bipolar disorder?,Bipolar

49419,Rant but not reallynewly diagnosed but then again Im not Hello all Im new here but I feel like I shouldnt be lol Yesterday was kind of a mental health day as I was talking to a social worker who was helping me find a new therapist. Long story short we got into my previous diagnosis and I told her mild depression adhd and anxiety. Yes these are true but however the one that is relevant to this post that popped up that I didnt know was bipolar. I end up contacting my previous psychiatrist because I did not recall him saying this I swear he didnt and he said yes but it is unspecified. He diagnosed me because of my constant irritability and made a point to say today I may be in remission because I wasnt as snappy as before. I honestly Just thought the things he would say would rub me the wrong way. Next week hell do a full evaluation. A few years back another therapist diagnosed me with bipolar disorder I forgot which but I remember her say something of me being manic. I honestly dont think shes working anymore but I wanted this evaluation at the time because I believed I was bipolar starting around 1316 years old. I had my reasons for it. Fast forward to last year my last psychologist said I was misdiagnosed and it was just adhdadd. I had mentioned my sex drivehyper sexuality which I may speak on in another post my impulsive urges to do things mood swings that can be intense etc etc she said it was just a mixture of my depression and adhd. So now here I am and thinking back to the things Ive done before and do now. These things I am trying to control and make sense of mainly the hyper sexuality I started to wonder if I was just a sex addict because of my habits and started looking into help to stop these things but yet my only problem is when Im in the mood lol. Im at a point in life where I want a second opinion or I just dont want to believe or say I am even though I have the signs more than Ive even mentioned.,Bipolar

45686,I'm new to Seroquel. What can I expect? Hello I am seeking some insight into the short and longterm affects of Seroquel. I'm being treated for anxiety depression and mood swings following a traumatic brain injury to the front right forehead. Anyway I saw for the first time a new doctor and she prescribed 50mg Seroquel to take at night for bipolar and to help me sleep. Well I cant say what its doing for bipolar but it is making me sleep like a rock. I mean knocks me completely out 0.51hr after taking it and then I'm sleeping for 1012hrs before waking up or coming to at all.

49423,Did everyone else get strip searched when they were sent to the mental hospital? Or went voluntarily ig. I didnt. I felt like I was treated like a criminal I felt so violated. I wasnt overweight I was fit at the time but it still felt so degrading. I remember liking how I looked as I took off my clothes and stood there. They just got all giggly and excited and said ooh a blonde!. After I literally hated my body I felt like it took everything sexual away from my body sorry tmi. I didnt eat for 3 days after then binged on the worst hospital food. I wish I said no. It literally affected me a lot more than it should have but it was a week after I turned 18 so like it just felt weird to me. The age isnt important it can feel weird to anyone idk im being salty.

46061,What helps or hurts in a work setting? Hi Everyones got different skills interests and goals but I was wondering if you could share aspects of your work environment that make a difference for you for better or worse. My SO has bipolar DO and is looking for work. He found something that seemed good on the face of it turned out they wanted him to do rotating shifts ie a month straight on nights. Between that and the long commute it was a less than ideal setup. Im wondering what other environmental factors are worth considering when looking at potential jobs. Could include management style size of organization big orgs might have decent HR staff and can afford to handle sick day requests but maybe the right smaller employers could offer a better culture ? Anything you can think of.Hes looking at sales or customer service as possibilities I think sales especially would suit his personality in many ways but wonder how the stressors might affect him competition with coworkers for commissions managing disappointment dealing with complaints etc... hes very personable and likes people so I can see that working for him its just the other stuff i worry might stress him out. Input from anyone in those fields would be amazing. Thank you!,Bipolar

50402,lamictal dreams so ive been on lamictal for like 15 years on and off its been the only med thats actually worked for me. but something ive noticed that ive never really discussed with anyone because its never actually been a serious problem is the insane dreams it causes me to have. i know for a fact its the lamictal because all the times ive gone off it the dreams stop. when i go back on it they start up again. they are SO vivid i always remember every detail. none of them make sense or have any deeper meaning. sometimes theyre just weird but other times theyre scary which is fine because i know its just a dream but it does rattle me. anyway just curious if this is a common thing? anyone else have weird ass lamictal dreams???,Bipolar
46287,A minor adjustment to my meds. So Ive been really lucky with meds and lifestyle changes being really successful for me. I have bipolar 2 and anxiety Ive been pretty much stable with little dips into mild depression for awhile. I was only taking gabapentin and Hydroxyzine. Gabapentin was the first mood stabilizer I ever tried and its always kept my hypomania at bay and my anxiety dialed down a little. Hydroxyzine comes in for sleep and breakthrough anxiety. It works. Im productive and mostly good. But the little dips into mild depression started to string together and I feared I might go into a deep depressive episode so I just told my doctor I want to add an SSRI. Were trying Celexa right now. So I took it last night she said some people prefer night some morning for the first time and couldnt sleep very well. So Im definitely going to switch to the morning from now on. I had a little stomach upset but not too bad. I slept less than I need to but I feel really good this morning. Im still on my gabapentin and Hydroxyzine. And will go back to take just the hydroxyzines at night so I go back to sleeping normally. BUT I dont know if its too soon to tell obviously its been like 12 hours but this morning I got up feeling really optimistic and happy to start my day. Maybe this is placebo effect although Im usually skeptical that things will work or maybe Im just super lucky with things working on the first try. I dont know. Just letting yall know that Im feeling optimistic and happy. I felt pretty good before but let my doctor know even though I was stable I was still struggling a little with depression and Im hopefully this addition works out. ,Bipolar

Hi so my Dad was diagnosed as bipolar manic a few years ago and has spent his time in and out of hospitals for the past few years It's always been in the back of my head that I could have received it too. Sometimes I feel at the top of the world and splurge on very useless things and spend a lot of my money other days I feel the exact opposite and just want to curl up and stay in my room all night.

50190,Bipolar 2 and Lamictal Good Morning. Ive been on Lamtical for about a year currently on 200mg for BP 2. Im talking to this guy who is absolutely amazing and literally everything Ive prayed for. But Ive noticed something has changed. With BP2 Ive always felt so deeply when it comes to emotions. Now its like emotional permanence. Together Im into him when I go home my feelings switch off. When it comes to intimacy I do not want to be touched because I feel so emotionally blunted. Yes the medication has done wonders for my low episodes BUT I miss feeling somewhat deeply. I do not know if this a BP2 thing or a medication thing. Before the medication I loved affection. This is so frustrating and I really hope someone can give me some advice and letting me know Im not alone thank you so much in advance.,Bipolar

And I'm like????? What is going on? Yes. I got better Depakene really did wonders but I don't know how to deal with this under my skin crawling feeling that there is a storm inside that I can't let out because it's blocked. My mom said I'm a healthy woman why do I even need therapy for? When I'm like this seriously? Is this just anxiety? Am I into a hypomanic episode and don't know because I'm supposed to be stable?

46228,Vitamin D and B12 Deficiency Sorry about lack of clarity Im not exactly sure how to phrase this because Im confused myself and I am on mobile.I sought out treatment after I was having some pretty concerning suicidal thoughts the past year.I reached out the a therapist at my University and immediately was referred to a psychiatrist under the guise of maybe benefitting from mood stabilizers.Before my psychiatry appointment I researched into mood stabilizers and saw they were used in treating bipolar. Read up on bipolar and really identified understood why she would recommend me to the psychiatrist assuming she thought I could have bipolar. Met with the psychiatrist and not to my surprise she said she was sure I was bipolar. However she wanted me to get bloodwork before starting me on lithium to see my levels in various things. She said she was going to diagnose me official with unspecified mood disorder until she saw my results regarding my thyroid. I was pretty bummed hearing this news she essentially told me I had bipolar disorder but lacked whether it was I or II so I still felt lost but like I was on the right track.Well my blood work came back and everything was normal except I had extremely low vitamin D and B12. My psychiatrist called me and gave me dosage for otc vitamins. I read into the situation wrong and assumed she was just reducing my issues down to deficiencies.I know these two deficiencies do not explain mania. Maybe vitamin D explains psychosis but I dont experience this. I felt like everyone was so sure I was bipolar and led me on to thinking I had a solution and I think this issue runs deeper than just supplements.I know many mental illnesses have links to vitamin deficiencies and I guess my confusion comes from whether or not anyone else experienced this along with being bipolar. I have an appointment on Thursday first one since bloodwork and was wondering if I should mention the bipolar diagnosis if she doesnt.TLDR is my doctor reducing her diagnosis to needing vitamin d and b12? Can this and bipolar coincide? ,Bipolar
50021,old friendship need serious advice a manic episode read til the end should i call this girl on the phone i need you all to be brutally honest. i sent a whole paragraph to a friendacquaintance about how i didnt like this girland had this whole plan not to sit next to her. shes like the most hated girl in school the one i didnt want to sit by. i made this whole weird plan about her getting there early and bringing binders that are labeled the sport i play on it to pretend we are planning sports camps. then said it would be good for national honors society. honestly if you guys want more information about the message i sent to her i can copy and paste it i just really dont want to because its embarrassing and hard to look back on. she responded well even though she hated her for a while too. she just said shes going through a lot just smile which is a perfect mature answer. i talked to her when i wasnt manic about how she is a really good remodel and i inspire to her and she really liked that. but before i did that IMPORTANT PART i texted my other friendidk what we are now about it. i said in voice memos that i was manic and wrote a whole paragraph about how i hated this girl then sent it to my other friend. this other girl who i was talking about before i wrote important part is someone she would say rather be friends with then me. then i spammed her with tiktoks afterward the voice memo because i told her i didnt want to be embarrassing by it in the future??? i dont know what i said it was clearly something id never say. the REAL PROBLEM is her mother has bipolar. but like the stereotypical bipolar not something that i would be like. she says stuff that you could probably image very disfunctional women and the father is too. this was probably a huge trigger for her. i forgot about it until i tagged her in a post and left me on read. then i asked her questions about the sport and she was never a dry texter and said stuff like yes no sure i realized then and remembered what happened. i texted her to ask if i could call her tomorrow and she said sure that was like 37 days ago though. im not sure whether to call her text her or even address this situation. if i did address it how would i would i call her text her or??? this is just a very hard situation and idk what to do. please help me,Bipolar
49428,I need a support system and I'm scared of myself I'm 30F. Been diagnosed since I was 14. By SEVERAL doctors. My parents never agreed as if there's something to agree on a medical diagnosis so I was unmedicated for most of my life so far. This gave me a lot of time to figure when a phase was coming what triggers it but also a lot of time to do stuff I shouldn't which hindered me greatly. Because of that I only started living on my own when I was 24 and that's when I started medication. To help with all this I have PCOS which triggers depression and long periods which trigger anemia so when I get my period I get depressive episodes AND I am physically exhausted and depleted. Which causes me to sleep more which causes me to go further into depression. My bf does his best to understand but it's all a bit beyond his grasp. My parents still don't recognize my situation so they are of no support for me. I don't have many friends and only one of them is actually supportive but she has a rough life and is usually busy with lots of work or something similar. So I'm on my own. I want to straighten up my sleep schedules but I know I can only do that by decreasing the amount of sleep drastically which will trigger a maniac episode. It's mostly mixed not generally full blown mania but it does get there sometimes and it's like a kinder egg you only know what you got when you open the box. So it can either go let's get the house deep cleaned or let's blow up our credit card take on 76 projects I won't complete and fck the neighborhood. You never know. So I'm scared to get my sh!t together basically. And I feel lonely in all this...,Bipolar
46857,Mixed episode first episode of any kind in years Hi allI just went through a mixed episode or at least what I think was a mixed episode never had one before after being consistently healthy for 4 years. In reflection Ive realized how much Ive taken my good health for granted. Id forgotten what it was like to feel completely out of control. I think Ive also been in denial in the past that I ever did anything outside of my control during an episode and downplayed it but this was the kick in the pants that reminded me what its really like. Anyway in the aftermath there are some things that are still really getting me down pretty sure Im still depressed. This is the first episode Ive had since my son was born. Before he was born I expressed to my wife that I was worried about passing bipolar on to him and I was even more worried about having an episode while I was home alone with him. Well I did end up having to be home alone with him a couple of times and it really terrifies me. At one point I was trying trying to get him into his car seat and he was giving me a really hard time. He wasnt being intentionally difficult really he was just playing trying to turn off the dome light. I ended up screaming at him in my driveway while I tried to get him into the seat so I could buckle him in. He started bawling. That was early on in the episode and at that point I hadnt realized yet that I was off in any way but a couple minutes later I realized I had just done something that I would never ever ever normally do. The other times I was with him I just felt so down that I could barely respond to his needs for food or a diaper change or whatever and definitely couldnt play with him. It was really hard to look at him in the face. He had no idea what was going on and couldnt understand why I couldnt read to him or play with cars when thats what we normally do every day. The one time I tried to read to him I started weeping before I got past the first page. Like I said I was worried that something like this would happen but I was not at all prepared to handle it nor was I at all prepared for how it would make me feel. After screaming at him Im worried Im going to become violent. And when I have trouble feeding him its just an overwhelming feeling that I cant take care of the kid that depends on me just to survive. I feel completely unable to parent properly and like I am a complete failure as a dad. It has me wondering if my family would be better off without me not necessarily in a suicidal kind of way more like should I just leave?. In my mind I keep telling myself Im being irrational but its pretty hard to believe right now. My wife knows Im feeling down still and last night she asked me if I was going to be ok with him in the morning I get him ready for the day and take him to childcare for the day because she leaves early. I know its a necessary question but the fact that it even needs to be asked really cuts deep. Anyway idk what Im really looking for with this post. Just needed to get it out. ,Bipolar
46009,Hypomania or Depression? BPII So my therapist wants me to monitor my mood and how often it switches from hypomania to depression to neutral. But for a few days I've just been annoyed with absolutely everyone and everything. Usually when I'm hypomanic I'm in a super good mood with the grandiosity the rapid speech feeling like I need to do everything all at once etc. Sometimes I have a tendency to get super annoyed at people for stupid reasons but it's always paired with the other symptoms. The past week however I've only had the irritability none of the other symptoms and I don't know what to call it. I've never had this before but can the irritability come with depression as well as hypomania?,Bipolar
50109,to PHP or not to PHP I went through a hypomanic mixed episode for the past two and a half weeks that came to a head on Wednesday resulting in SI. Im no longer experiencing the SI and had a med change but was asked if Id be open to a PHP. Today I received the intake phone call and they want me to start next Wednesday. If my existence within the bipolar lens is continuously cycling and from stable to unstableif Im no longer experiencing the SI do I still participate in the PHP? I dont currently have any providers other than my psychiatrist which is definitely an issue. Im also worried about taking the time off work because I have a big project due soon and my colleague is out. All in all its only 57 days so do I do the one thing I have been putting off for years because of school and career or do I put myself first and participate? Is it worth the time effort and disappointment of my boss knowing that Im going to cycle for the rest of my life?,Bipolar

49923,Cant concentrate I have so much work and homework to do and Im really struggling because everything just feels kind of fuzzy and confused. Probably because of the meds.I have a random ADHD medication left over from when I used to get those and I am trying to talk myself out of thinking I should maybe take that. Or some herbal pill thats similar.Maybe I should have some tea or something. I hate that I have so much trouble functioning now. But I just need encouragement or support to not take something that might put me on a path to mania. I know I shouldnt but,Bipolar
49563,I'm at risk of losing my home I'm not throwing a pity party here I just genuinely want to know if other people have done this too. I have spent so much money over the years racked up a lot of debt. I've only been stable for the past month or so thankfully to lithium but my monthly expenses are nearly equal to my income. I can no longer afford my home that my family currently resides in. I am ashamed and embarrassed that I ever let my spending get so bad but I guess that's where being on no medication can hurt you. I submitted a loss mitigation application to my mortgage company and got a letter from my psychiatrist stating that I've been diagnosed with bipolar 1. Is anyone else in the same boat or have been here before?,Bipolar
45989,Been a bit hypomanic lately. Just went on a cleaning spree of the apartment now it is clean and organized. What's the best thing you have ever done while hypomanic? Been feeling hypomanic this week and today I went on a cleaning spree of my apartment.I rarely clean or organize anything so there was a lot that needed to be done. Granted my apartment is 400 square feet so there isn't a lot to clean but it felt really good to have it clean and organized. I still need to clean my desk but I think that's just a lost cause at this point. But the kitchen is spotless and a lot of the clutter has been dealt with. Sometimes hypomania isn't a bad thing! What's the best thing you've done while hypomanic? ,Bipolar
46611,Is having a routine bad? Ive been through a very severe depression this winter. I was self harming and I ended up being suicidal and basically almost worthless as I couldnt do anything but sit in bed and sleep. I had my meds adjusted 3 times and once my pdoc added Seroquel to the mix everything changed. I feel stable I sleep well and wake up rested I feel good overall. Not manic good but normal good.The problem is I developed a certain routine.I do almost the same thing everyday. I can finally cook clean the house work and function like Im supposed to. But Im scared of anything that threatens to break my routine like going out having friends over etc. I managed to stop taking naps because I no longer feel mentally drained. Its not about comfort zone its just that I felt so bad and Ive been in such a dark place that right now Im happy to feel stable something I havent felt in a long time. My previous manic episode was pretty bad too.Is it wrong that I cling to my routine? I feel like I need this routine for now until I feel Im able to do other things too. Am I wrong?,Bipolar
45779,i think this might be mania again and i'm scared i've been very stable for the last months and i'm on my medication but in the past few days i've been sleeping for 23 hours per night and even though it's not time enough to guarantee i'm having a manic episode i'm sure that it's not normal. this just can't be normal. i keep feeling a weird rush my heart is racing all the time and i'm breathing fast even when i'm laying down. my head hurts a lot but when i drink coke it stops. today at my spanish class i thought my book was an ipad and started touching as if there were buttons and i was hearing the professor talking in french. i can barely talk coherently because there's too much in my mind and i forget things almost immediately. i've been studying obsessively lately to distract myself from how miserable my current life is and well it's been working so far but i also feel like i'm developing dementia as if my brain is not capable of storing so much information. holy shit this must be mania again.,Bipolar
45898,Not sure what this is. I have these kind of episodes where my mind suddenly brings up dark memories and emotions. I'm overwhelmed by them and my mind interprets my surroundings based on the feelings and memories I'm experiencing. I'm aware of my surroundings and I don't zone out but the thoughts become overwhelming and I can't get them out of my head. It's not a flashback. I don't know what it is.,Bipolar

49948,Horribly stuck About six years ago I moved back home to take care of my mom with dementia. I was the best chose because I was on disability and had been stable on medication and off probation for a couple of years. The first couple of years weren't so bad she still talked and could walk on her own. I was there to make sure she had lunch took her pills and didn't wander off. Now she's bedridden dosent talk and it's and a struggle to eat. I take two mood stablers and two atypical antipsychotics plus a benzo. I still stuck in painful mixed state. I've have two short hospital stays in the last 9 months. I don't know what to do I promised my stepdad I would see it though with mom but every day just seams to adds more agitation. I feel like someone is pouring molten lead down my throat. I hate breaking my word. My step dad has a little more than a year before he can retire. My meds keep me out of full Mania but the mix state aggravated by stress is really starting to get to me but I can't let my family down.,Bipolar
49548,Do you guys ever get stuck in quiet mode Ive noticed in moments of high emotional stress I start to become unable to speak words are flowing through my head and I feel stuck and just cant get myself to open my mouth to speak sometimes I am just like that until Im able to force myself to speak again but Ive noticed its been getting really bad recently in my current relationship and Im looking to see if this is a common problem for bipolar or if its something else causing it,Bipolar

47866,Sorry guys I gotta take a thoughts n feelings dump right here So I literally don't talk to anyone anymore. Super depressed going about my days. I would be dead such a long time ago if it wasn't for the weirdest most pathetic thing ever. The first person and basically only time I've been truly in love I doubt we'll ever hang out again let alone end up together. But I love her so much still so many years later that even that .000002 chance of feeling us hold each other is just enough to get through another day. I'm 32 now. And it's been over ten years since I've had that feeling and experience. But out of all my ups and downs and insane experiences traumatic shit everything... She gives me the feeling I need to just get through things. Days. Sometimes down to the minutes and seconds. Her life is normal and fulfilling and pretty nice if you ask me I doubt she thinks of me and I'm not a strung out piece of shit like I was years back anymore but no matter how normal my life looks now a days it's so empty and it's always felt empty without the feeling she gave me so long ago. I feel like such a pathetic loser for holding onto this love for so long without reciprocation without telling her and with it having been the only reason I've ever got through how terrible I had my life in the past. I'll probably die with that secret someday too but I just wanted to put it somewhere out into the universe. Even if it's just here on Reddit. That I've had this feeling I've held onto that I've embedded into the fiber of my being so that I take it everywhere I'll ever go and it's the why to every breath I unconsciously take. I don't expect this to mean anything to any of you. But there's love in the world that no darkness can bring down no drug could compare no words can describe and no time can erase and I hope that you find it and if you've had it and lost it as I have may you live with that small hope you feel when you reminisce.,Depression

11870,Two days ago I had my first mental breakdown at work because I was blamed for everything for a mistake which in my opinion was not my fault crying for 15 minutes at home homeofficeLet me summarize what happened. I am a sales not manager guy and I am in charge of pricing and getting orders from my customers and especially maintaining the situation for newRampD projects and its sample phases. I have one senior manager colleague from purchasing who is in charge of purchase and she is responsible for preparing stock. So we have to unfortunately keep in touch and work together as she needs to know the project situation from my customers and prepare stock accordingly.So in beginning of this year my customer gave me information of the material list and that SOP is scheduled for November 2021. The lead times for us to prepare is long 40 weeks thus my colleague keeps asking me if she should issue orders to our suppliers. As I did not want to go for any risks I warned my customer about the lead times and said they should release firm orders to us so I have a commitment and know they will buy the stuff we prepare. My customer kept saying the list is still not finalized but the list would go to the forecast soon and release order soon and they are aware of the lead times. I explained to my colleague to only order if we have something firm and she agrees and says she would wait until the list of items are in our customer's purchase listforecast in their system.Still in mid of 2021 we still have not received any firm orders and I kept pushing my customer every week. The only reply was that orders will come soon. Then last week I received feedback from my customer that the list got smaller and only 4 of the 10 original items are needed Still no order from customer. At the moment my colleague told our director that we actually already issued order to our supplier to my surprise for the 10 items and I am at fault for now having dead stock because I am bad at managing this. Furthermore She kept asking and harassing me why the customer did not release any orders despite SOP is November. I told her I explained to the customer many times and they said they understand the situation and will wait with the lead time. Furthermore it is not our fault if the customer does not release orders when we explained them many times the conditions. Well she did not care or give a fuck.So after that my colleague harassed me for being bad at this job and managing poorly and being fault for having dead stock now SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PURCHASES TO OUR SUPPLIERS!!!! she of course snitched and complained at out managing director and blamed everything on me. Because I am quite the small fry compared to her in the company hierarchy the director at first believed only her story and continued criticizing me. Every try of me to explain that I told her to only order when there is commitment from customer and that we did not know the list of materials was still pending until last week was seen as a poor excuse. My director looked for reasons to blame me such as it was also my responsibility to oversee what is ordered and to tell the customer they need to buy our stuff if we already prepare that for them. When I tried to say we should not have ordered at the first place which is her responsibility I was just shut down.After that I just hoped to die with my 30 years instantly. I was just frustrated of everything and wanted to cease to exist and cried in the corner for 15 minutes.... I think this is what we call power harassment in the office and I guess I was the victim... Never felt so miserable but I think this is unfortunately quite common in work life. I am at this company now for 4 years and I realized the senior purchasing colleague is a bigshot because she is good at maintaining her juniors low and never letting anyone overtake her. She keeps all the difficult work for herself so that no one can replace her. So unfortunately even if she has problems with some colleagues she is not easily replaceable.Today my superior helped me and we had a 2 hour meeting with my director explaining what I did for this project since 2020 and made clear that I never supported the idea to order stuff without commitment from customer. Thank god after that my director believed me and said he will check why our purchasing team ordered the stuff....But still I still feel miserable for being blamed and that senior colleague from purchasing of mine will for sure continue to do so next time and blame everyone for little mistakes as long as she benefits from that...I used to be such a motivated man when I started working now I just realize how fuckup this worklife can be.... First mental breakdown at work and cried for 15 minutes,Depression

22817,Hi.About a month ago I was put on a standard dose of nortriptyline. Since then I have noticed I am waking up very early and unable to get back to sleep. I am lucky if I get 6 hours a massive change from my usual 9 or 10. I have been on a lot of antidepressants before and none have ever had this effect on my sleep. Is this something common to antidepressants or nortriptyline specifically? Or is this problem unrelated to the new medication? Thanks for any helpanswers. I will be seeing my psychiatrist in a few weeks so will bring it up with him as well. Can antidepressants because early awakenings?,Depression
12522,This is it. I literally cannot take it anymore. For the last time I will attempt to email my exgf and just be open and honest with her. I cannot take this everyday thought of is she doing ok? Is she doing well. I have been sitting with bottled up emotions for almost a year without having the ability to talk to her. I miss her I want to talk to her I want to see her I want to know that she is ok I want to smell that mango flavor lip balm she had and most importantly I just want to hold her close and know that she is safe. This lockdown bullshit has caused so much turmoil in my life from losing my girlfriend to having to deal with health scare into clinics and seeing psychiatrists and all that crap.... My body cannot take it anymore. I have nothing to live for. I am properly losing my job next week Tuesday as I cannot keep up anymore. I have no friends I have no one to go to I have no one to call. No one to talk to. I literally do not want to live anymore. Lief vir jou Charissa. Die lewe was n lied met jou in my arms!

I do not even have people around me who tell me that I genuinely have 0 friends like what the actual fuck is wrong with me. Everyday feels the exact same and I hate it just endless hours of nothing like god damn I have fallen so low that I am posting my feelings on Reddit. Like holy shit I am such a loser dude its so funny how pathetic. God damnit I cannot even talk to people normally now in public I am not going to make any new friends haha I hate my life so much.

26159,I lost my dog two months ago. I let him out to run for a bit at night and never saw him again. He was a lively dog and in my place it is normal to let your dogs out and run around the neighborhood. I always thought he would come back. I thought maybe he just found a female dog and do dog stuff but days turned to weeks and weeks turned to months.Now I am lying awake in my bed crying my eyes out at the painful realization he is gone. And I ask myself why? Why did I let him out that night? Why could not I just waited for him to come back instead of sleeping and expecting he will be back in the morning? Why did not I give him more love and care? Why did I complain about cleaning his pee and shit? Why did not I hold him more? Why did not I hug him more when it was clear he loved being petted by me? Why did not I treat him better? Why did not I make his short life better? I do not even have proper pictures of him...I have so many regrets and the heavy pain I have in my heart is pulling me down. I have taken my meds but them seem useless at this moment.I can only pray and hope that if he is gone he would be in a happier place with all the other dogs I have lost.it is easier to accept death when I saw it with my own eyes. It was easier for me to accept my other dogs' deaths when I managed to properly say goodbye and bury them.But this heavy feeling of not knowing where my dog is if he is alive or not if he is okay if he is trying to come back home and in the worst case scenario if he suffered before passing away. It hurts not knowing what happened and probably never getting answers.Wherever you are I hope you are at peace. I love you. I lost my dog and I feel like a useless human being,Depression

47696,I find it so frustrating as a highly anxious and depressed person to do career tests because they rely on your passion for specific activities and I find myself answering I dislike it very much to the various questions e.g. working in construction healthcare finance whatever. I've been trying to get back to work again because it seems my severe depression and anxiety won't go away and there is only so much medication and therapy can help me. Of course I haven't tried every kind of therapy but what had been offered to me at low cost. But I've tried many medications.Anyhow I feel very frustrated because after trying couple of online part time jobs like writing marketing stuff on websites and finding myself not motivated enough to work sufficient hours to make ends meet I'm trying to start from zero again and do some career tests to find what motivates me. But those tests don't offer some magical information but just rely on what you're passionate about. Like they give you 50 questions and ask you how much you like doing different activities like installing cabinets diagnosing disease in people giving financial advice to someone wanting to get a loan helping a disabled person get dressed playing a musical instrument in front of an audience taking care of sick animals etc etc etc.I hate them ALL! None of these activities excite me. Because having a job is always about what others expect of you. But mental illness sucks so much of your energy that there is so little left for the job.Like if I'm a cashier my high anxiety and depression and the various thoughts and emotions and physical symptoms I experience will take so much of my energy to control and nothing left to put on a smile and make a customer feel welcome and at the same time do my job of scanning items very quickly and correctly.That's why I've been trying to find jobs that are just online and things I can do on my own time so that whenever the damned mental health issues give me a break then I can do the job. The problem is there are too many people doing these jobs and they pay so little that I've had to start looking at other options. Damn it I don't know what I want to hear from you to be honest I mean I already am so filled with selfhatred and hatred for the world I am working myself into anger just writing about it.,Depression

8683,TW suicideIts currently 6am and I cannot sleep. Its 6am and have not gone to sleep yet. I am too overwhelmed too sleep.I have an appointment with a psychiatrist for diagnostic evaluation in a couple weeks. My summer break is over a few days after my appointment and I am panicking. I am not ready to go back to school yet. I need a diagnosis before I go back I literally cannot function everyday of my life is living hell and I cannot take it anymore. My parents will not let me get vaccinated for covid and I do not want to go back to school where most everyone is not vaccinated. I am really worried for my appointment with the psychiatrist. I am worried that I will not be diagnosed on the first appointment and Ill have to go back to school without meds not knowing what is wrong with me.Last year I failed most of my classes and I really do not want to retake my failed classes at irl school because I am too embarrassed to let everyone know that I am failing. My pediatrician recommended that I get a tutor and a 504. I have already have a 504 plan but my parents and I know nothing about it so its doing nothing to help me. I am too embarrassed to get a tutor because I do not want to feel stupid in front of a tutor if I do not know something.I am having a really bad time right now and I am so tired but not like sleepy tired I am just so tired of feeling like shit everyday and not being understood. I feel like I am going crazy. I am not planning on killing myself or anything I just wish there was nothingness. Everyday I get worse though everyday I get more and more sick of everything and want to say fuck it. Sometimes I at least want to halfass trying to kill myself so that people will know that I am actually suffering and they will take me seriously. Idk thanks for listening bye. I am not doing too good,Depression
12963,I am 19. I usually do not tell my life stories on here bc I know no one will care.But growing up I basically lived in fear of either getting whooped or getting yelled at for not getting perfect grades in school. My dad would only be happy with me if I came back home with good grades. Otherwise he basically disliked me and told me to work harder. This turned me into a perfectionist who absolutely cannot stand criticism. It does not matter if 1000 people like what I am doing. If one dislikes it it takes a massive toll on my confidence because it was not a perfect turnoutI have anxiety. I dislike talking. I feel I am doing everything wrong. My friends do not support me. I have no confidence. Idk what I am doingTheres too much stress on my mind and I never like talking about it to people bc I know they will not care. Crying is for women is what my mom said to me when my dad was yelling at me and I started crying. Three years have passed since she said that and I have not cried since even after my dad passed recently. I hate talking about these things to people but I decided to share this to you guys only since no one knows me on here I hold all of my stresses in which places me into mania. I do not want to talk about them to other people in person bc I do not want to get my feelings invalidated for the 100th time in a rowMy confidence is non existent and today is one of my lowest days.

23543,Short time lurker first time poster. I have m33 just been diagnosed with depression. I have avoided getting help for quite some time. I have started seeing a therapist I have a couple of months off work certified. I gave two questions1 the doctor offered meds but I refused as is prefer to try and tackle this without meds if possible. Should I be considering meds?2 how do I help my family and friends help me? How can I help them understand how I am feeling? Just been diagnosed with depression,Depression
9506,I was diagnosed with MDD about 2 years ago. Since then I have been working with my psychiatrist to find a medication that works for me. This past semester I hit a different kind of low. This rock bottom state made me miss a lot of classes. I am an engineering student and even missing one class can put anyone very behind. I explained my situation to my professor and she suggested I medically withdraw from the semester. After talking with my psychiatrist and new found psychologist I decided that withdrawal was the best choice for me. The process to medically withdraw is long and difficult because mental illness can be seen as a chronic illness. The board approved my request to withdraw. This is good news. Now I am in the process of filling out a tuition refund appeal. I have to write a personal statement about my situation. This refund is worth 9000. Also I can only submit this repeal once so I want to get things right. I am having a hard time putting words together to accurately depict my dip to put it lightly in depression. Has anyone else medically withdraw from school and been through tuition refund appeal? I had to medically withdraw from school because of my dip in depression.,Depression
14439,Life sucks.There is nothing interesting or exciting anymore. I used to have hobbies that I enjoyed but nowadays it just feels like I am carrying out tasks and feeling numb. I have things to do but I have zero interest to do them so I constantly procrastinate. I wish I could just stay in bed all day and do nothing even though I hate it too. Social life sucks. I have one real friend who lives far away so we do not see that often. I have my parents who live far away too. Apart from that I just have friends who use me. They call me only if they need something and they talk to me like they care but act differently. I have tried to socialize and get to know other people unsuccessfully. I try be kind to everyone and I do not judge people. I hate the way I look and I keep thinking that is the reason why I do not have friends. There are more people in my life but they are not friends they are just people who I know. If I diseappeared right now my parents would be the only people who would notice that. I do not talk about my feelings to anyone because it would drive them away and I do not want to be a burden. Life sucks and if I could just stop existing if would be great. I do not want to kill myself. Sorry if you read this. This sucks too I do not like living,Depression

11915,I am 21 years old 22 in September. Until I was about 17 my life was in perfect harmony. Good grades happy relationship excited for the future.But that did not last. My dads alcohol addiction finally overcame him despite multiple attempts at rehab and he disappeared for about 2 months before being found dead in an apartment. he would basically drank himself to death. And then the next year my lovey grandmother who Id formed a very close bond with following the loss of her sonmy father also passed away from an unexpected and aggressive cancer. After that everything just went south. I became shorttempered angry at the world. The relationship I was in ended soon after and worst of all she found someone else after just 2 weeks bearing in mind wed been together for 2 years at that point. So I went to university hoping that getting away from home would be a sort of reset a new start so to speak.Nope within about a month I was smoking weed popping pills and living every selfdestructive fantasy I could think of. It was fun at the time a nice release but in the long run it was anything but.Fastforward to next year the diagnosis comes in Post traumatic stress disorder generalised anxiety and depressive disorder. And I have now blown almost all the money left to me from dad on cigarettes and drugs.And to top it all off I failed uni. So I am now poor unemployed and realising that I have gone down EXACTLY the same road as dad did. Like I did not learn anything from watching his mistakes.I do not really know where I am going with this to be honest. I know that I am to blame and nobody else. But I just felt like I needed to get all this off my chest.Thank you to anyone who took the time to read I am not suicidal or anything at least not yet just looking for some guidance honestly x I feel like I have made so many mistakes in life,Depression
19579,These days I am not feeling good enough pathetic and that I am failing at life. I am tired of fighting for everything. I have had it seeing everyone around me getting what they want and I am stuck drowning. I had to fight for years and I am so tired of fighting the fight. Without anyone to help. Sometimes I wonder why fight? you only going to get shot why an arrow again. what is the use to keep fighting? All I want is to be happy for once in my life. I try to be strong and not let everything get to me but it is hard when you always get knocked down. I can see why people give up. I try to not let epilepsy get me down it is who I am right? I think what would it be to live life without epilepsy will my life be better? not so much fighting? would it be easier for me to get a job? what do you do when you feel you had enough have no strength to move forward I even feel like I cannot keep friends. what wrong with me? is it me?,Depression
39171,thick fog of dread in the front of my head that disconnect me from my interest appetite and ability to feel anything remotely close to ok and it s there tf is this,Depression
7831,So introduction I guess.. my name is Michael and I am 20 yo. I live in Slovakia though I would be surprised if anybody knew where that is located. And I am struggling with..I do not know maybe deppresion?The problems started like long time ago back when I was still a child. My mum hated the fuck out of my dad and for some reason my dad hated her too. My dad is like the typical stereotype guy who thinks that woman should be in kitchen taking care of her husband. He was and still is to be honest addicted to alcohol. I remember when I was a child and my mum had to go away for a couple of days that everytime my dad stepped through front door I prayed to god because I was always afraid that he arrives drunk again. I was so genuinely happy when he did not and I always hid in my closet when he did. In school I was not very popular. I am the kind of guy who thinks that if you have the means if you have the option and ability to help somebody you should by all means do that. Of course people tend to take advantage of that. Everytime they needed something I would do it eventhough if it meant that I had to spent 4 hours doing their homework or writing an essay. Of course I was bullied too when they did not need me because why the fuck not right I deserved that. I did not have a single true friend everybody I considered to be my friends they insulted me and humilliated me most of the time and I did not like it. I was so alone that I just decided that I had to have a friend. And that is when my schizophrenia probably started.I made myself a friend. He is called Martin Ladec I even created him a facebook account so I could chat with him because I had always wanted to have friend that I could chat with on facebook. Everytime I was alone I talked to him. My imaginary best friend. It all started like nothing too serious every conversation I had with him always played in my head like I only imagined that I was talking to him because I had known that he was not real. But then I started talking out loud to him.. It just went like this I do not really know how to explain it properly. I just sat on the ground and started crying and telling him how I was feeling but after I was done talking I got up smiled at the spot where I had been crying and tried to reassure the spot you know like if I was Martin cheering up Michael. After some time I got better but then I started hearing voices it was around 8th or 9th grade. They were telling me how pitiful I was that I should kill myself that everybody hated me. I started to feel really deppressed and it was not helping when the actual people were telling me how pitiful I am and how they hated me. So at the end of elementary school my mind was shattered like glass into so many parts. Part that wants to kill me other part who argues with the first part and telling me to live Martin and myself.Then the high school came and I found new friends..like true friends. I liked them so much and they seemed to like me too. There was this particular guy that I enjoyed spending my time with we had so much in common. He loved the same type of music I did movies TV series and so on. Of course I had fallen in love with him. I did not even realized that I was gay but when I did I just went along with it. But I loved and still I love him so much..I guess I was really obsessed with him. I was jealous everytime he went out with somebody else of course i did not tell him I am not dumb I knew it would ruin everything I was thinking of him everytime I went to bed and everytime I woke up. He had a best friend our classmate and the three of us started hanging out a lot. It got to a point when we had like really deep shit conversation and I remember that the other guy not the one I love told me because he could see that I had been struggling The stupidest thing that a person can do when he has some problems is that he never tells anyone about those problems. Talk about it. and then the guy I loved said We are telling everything to each other. Tell us. And I told them because I believed in them. I told them about the voices and about Martin and everything. It went fine it seemed they believed me but of course.. shit had to get worse. for the sake of this the guy I love is T and his best friend is SAt one point I do not know what happened but S accused me of lying. He said that nothing that happened to me never really happened to me and that I like the attention I am getting because of that and I just want people to pity me. He told other guys in my class and so I became the guy who is constantly lying exaggerating and deppressed. I never stopped talking to them though. I understood that this shit is really hard to believe. T was still my number 1 friend because he seemed that he still believed me. I started to love him even more. I have always had money I did not even know how. From insurance when my grandma and aunt died and what they left me. So always when I needed or wanted something I had it. And he did not have the luck he had like no money. Like he was not poor or anything but when he wanted Converse for example he could not afford. And I felt selfish because I had the money and he did not so I felt like it would be really selfish of me not to buy things for him. I bought him those. And trousers. And jackets. And games on ps4 which by the waay I bought just so I could play with him . I remember that once he told me how much he dreamed of getting a new computer but his mum did not let him have it. So I literally started building my own new pc for 600 eventhough the one I currently had was completely fine. The old one I had cost me around 500. I told I am that I had built myself a new pc so I can give him my old one. For free. And I did. I literally spent on him around 600 because I gave him my monitor because he did not have one and I had to buy myself a new one. And I still was so happy when I bought those things for him and gave those things to him. I loved him so much like this is probably the true love you know.Then last year came and it all went to shit. It was my last year on my school and we had a party the entire class after Stukova. Stukova is like the Ball you have in last year of high school. After Stukova you have Dozvuky where all students just drink a lot . S dated my classmate but they broke up before Dozvuky. I was really good friend with S' ex at that time. I am not going to explain what happened exactly this post is long enough even without those details but basically S fooled around with two girls. Two girls his ex hated the most. She was really sad and I was talking to her the entire time. After Dozvuky and everything I met him and he told me that I really fucked up. He told me that I disgust him and if I feel hurt that I deserve it. He blamed me for something I did not do. He did not want me to explain to him and he stopped talking to me. In the same week every guy from our class stopped talking to me including T and I realized that he told them his version and they all feel same as him about me. It could not come in worse moment. I was feeling during this time deppressed a lot. I had a friend M She was like my best friend after S and T. She knew that I was gay and she knew that I loved T. Still she fooled around with him when we had parties. When I was there. 3 times. Everytime she did it she told me that she was sorry and promised me she would never do it again. And she did it two more times. One time i was in the same bed as T and M and they started making out next to me. It was the worst feeling ever because I loved him so much and she knew and still she did it. I was heartbroken and defeated and I started cutting myself. And then S dumped me because of the misunderstanding and every guy dumped me and I was alone again. Fortunately I am not that stupid and I realized that I coudln't continue like this. I am proud of myself that I realized that I need professional help because most people cannot do it.So I started looking for a psychologist at first.Someone to talk to. I tried 9 different ones. And they all told me the same thing. Only time can help. I did the Rorschach test numerous times and still they were not able to find anything wrong with me eventhough my every goddamn answer was really deppressing negative and not positive at all. I cut myself. I hear voices telling me that I should kill myself or the ones that hurt me. I created an imaginary friend. For fuck sake even I as a patient was able to realize that something is a bit fucking fishy about me. They did not help. One psychologist even tried to touch my thigh. So that much for proffessional help. So I started looking for a psychiatrist . I told him the same story and he gave me pills. Arisppa. It did not help. The best part is that I told him that I had told S about my voices and stuff and how I hurt felt when he did not believe me and accused me of being a drama queen and guess what did the fucking psychiatrist asked? Michael are you telling me the truth? Do you really hear the voices or have you made this all up just to skip school or be different? To let people pity you? Is this even possible in modern world? in which fucking dimension would sane psychiatrist ask such a dumb question? I snapped and I started laughing hysterically after that. I was laughing at my place for good 3 hours and then I started crying. And laughing after that. Some people just insult those who kill themselves and say that it is selfish decision. I totally understand suicide now. I have problems I accept that. I wanted help I desperatelly needed help but everything is against me. In this world if you are not selfish bastard you cannot be happy. This world is not made for people like me. it is really easy to say that get some help because apparently nobody can help. Like I do not even know if anybody is going to read this or not. But if some lost sould read this entire novel to the end just wanted to let you know that do not worry I promise I WILL NOT kill myself. I tried sure but I am not strong enough to do that. Besides my paranoid me thinks that it would make other guys happy and I do not want to give them this satisfaction.Honestly I do not know what I expected from this. I do not know if I want your help because I know you cannot help me. But I tried everything. Psychologists psychiatrists telling friends group therapies fucking taiwan mantras to calm my mind tropical teas and herbs to soothe my mind. Nothing worked so I just thought fuck it let us give it a shot. Maybe miracle will happen. do not know what else to do so I just leave it up here,Depression
18760,I am over 18 however I am a dependent for obvious reasons. I just got myself back into therapy for the first time in 6 years back then I was a minor and I am unsure about how much I can say without her telling my parents. I want to be honest with my therapist because what is the point if I hide things but my parents do not take finding out their child self harms very well like most parents I would assume but I just cannot mentally deal with being yelled at or see them cry if they found out so I really do not want them to know. Is my therapist obligated to tell them I self harm because I am a dependent even though I am 20 years old? Any advice would be appreciated. Can my therapist tell my parents about my self harming tendencies? Tagged nsfw for potential triggers,Depression

12381,I cannot take it anymore. My life is so meaningless and I am just a waste of space. I am 24 years old and I have done nothing I have accomplished nothing I am getting nowhere in life and I never will yet I am forced to be alive. Every day is getting worse than the last and the people who make me live this worthless life are incredibly selfish for doing so. Why cannot they understand that my life is not worth living? The only reason they want me alive is so they do not feel sad when I am gone. They do not think about how torturous being alive is for me and they do not want to understand they just want me to keep suffering for their sake so they are inconvenienced with my death. I cannot take it anymore though I am just so tired of trying and pretending everything is ok. Forced to live,Depression
19486,just being alive is absolute torture for me each and every day. i wake up everyday disappointed that i did not die the night before. over the last 2 months I have been through medication and therapy but to no avail. I have been in hospitals for being a danger to myself and self harmed so much to the point where i have scars in both my arms that i doubt will ever heal. life has been a huge downward spiral for me for as long as i can remember and ruining a friendship with someone who was the only person who made me feel anything meaningful in a long fucking time was the straw that broke the camels back. i complain that there is barely anything good in my life but that is because i fuck up everything good in it. now I have been here for the past few weeks trying to do whatever i can to escape this world and how awful and lonesome and empty i feel even for a few hours with drugs or alcohol or whatever but i always come back to the same hole where i always am. i have a little brother and every time he tells me he loves me i get sad because i do not want to leave him but I am in so much fucking pain and i do not know how much longer i can go on for without ending it all. I have fought and fought depression and took all the right steps to get better but nothing works if anything i feel even worse. i do not know if anyone will read this but i just need to vent. i do not know how much longer i can do this for,Depression
9927,I noticed when I have told my friends and family that I got Covid again and have to quarantine I have had people not reach out to me to see how I am doing. Its like they feel some sort of pity for me and honestly makes me feel ashamed about myself. Nobody reaches out to me or calls me to see how I am doing. Not even my own family really cares. Its like they are supposed to care but not out of genuineness. What makes me livid is that they are still going out knowing fully well I have covid and I am quarantine in my room. I feel so lonely and unloved. Why do people ostracize you when you are going through a difficult time. I felt the same way when I went through melanoma cancer a few years back. I had some friends stop reaching out to me. Its awful and its like I am reliving all over again. Being stuck home alone has me depressed more than ever.,Depression
24654,So badly. I just want to know what its like to wake up and look forward to the day ahead and have hope in my future and who I am and who I am growing into. That is all. I WISH I was not DEPRESSED,Depression
11238,here is something I wrote to just kind of express how I am feeling felt like sharing. There a person inside of me He wants out but he cannot break that wall His cries are loud and ever apparent The desperation to rise above myself is paralyzing Enclosused imprisoned repression depression Hope is lost hope is gained day in day out Disassociation and confusion Is it worth it? Am I strong enough to let go? Am I weak enough to hold on? Am I part of something bigger? Am I a prisoner of something smaller? Can I say the words in my head? Do they ring hallow? Am I spinning out of control? Maybe I am asking the wrong questions Maybe there is no right questions Maybe there are no right answers Maybe I am subjective Maybe my purpose is purposeless Will these words be enough? Can I ride above myself? I want to break out replace this person with something better it is not a cry for help it is plead for affirmation Just tell me I am not alone Just tell me I am okay Just tell me I am okay Please tell me I am okay Had to get it out somehow,Depression

12127,It feels so stupid but it is been a day and a half that I have not talked to my SO because of being on a minibreak and as soon as I am done doing stuff work or watching a movie I just want to tell my partner about it and now I cannot and I just get sad. I have problems communicating but with him I can do it perfectly I was literally never able to express myself with anyone irl like with him so when we were not a couple yet I did not feel lonely but just bored because I never really knew how good it feels to have someone to tell what you do and have them care about it. Most of my thoughts are just me talking like if I was telling him what I am doing. I just need someone to talk too,Depression

39037,i m currently taking 0mg effexor xr for anxiety and depression i ve also taken lexapro 0mg for year and zoloft 00mg for a year both had similar effect barely put a dent in my anxiety and really helped with the severe symptom of depression but it s still there my anxiety is still bad particularly my physical symptom i always feel on edge and nervous i can always feel my heart pounding hard not fast regardless of my mental state and it s the most debilitating symptom i feel i can never relax and never truly enjoy myself because of how anxious i feel i take propranolol 0mg twice a day and is the only thing that help a little with the physical symptom but they re still problematic i have tried meditation breathing exercise exercise i have read a multitude of book on cognitive behavioral therapy acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness no exercise in the book ha helped with the symptom whatsoever i should also mention i have had test for my thyroid adrenal any gi or diet issue antibody etc and i m sure i can rule out physical cause is anyone else in a similar boat to me and found buspirone helped if no ha anything helped you thanks,Depression
23074,4 or 5 years ago I went out into the freelance world after a series of fulltime positions I gave myself a year to see if I could make it work and thanks to a few series of good connections the ball kept rolling. Most of the work I was getting was unexciting but hey it paid and I was living the dream as they say. Well here I am still taking on the work that gets passed my way and while the checks have gotten smaller I have managed to be a bit smarter instead of trying to buy my happiness I have started saving and doing the responsible thing...have even managed to get a car a nicer apartment and long term girlfriend hooray for me. The only issue is I sit here now and feel as though the job I work in I no longer have excitement of motivation from. I would be lying if I said I have that positive feeling from anything in my life outside of a brief flicker from time to time. it is really hard as I see in this area so many of my peers that I began with excelling to new heights where I feel like I am pivoting in the same place. I know the things that need to be done in order to move ahead but truly I feel stuck in quicksand the idea of doing the work seems so daunting. I am looking to have the spark in an effort to begin the process but I know that is unlikely to be the way things work out in reality. I finally have insurance again so want to get back into therapy as this is a blanket issue impacting all areas of my life and has been for some time. ampx200BJust wondering if this is something anyone else has really ran into especially when you work for yourself. I have considered even a parttime job to fill the gaps in between but I do not necessarily want to just give in to the avoidance bit of things. Appreciate you guys in advance.

I have been overthinking a lot and feeling anxious all the time. it is like my mind cannot take a break from all the thoughts.I have been distracting myself from other things to divert my attention but nothing seems to be working. I am having panick attack most of the time. I do not know why I am crying. I do not really know the reason at all! Sometimes I am okay but it does not take long. I am feeling like my body just shut down and I am getting this weird chills even though it is not cold from where I am living.At night really is the worst. I feel really really nauseous from all the thoughts that I have been thinking. I cannot control myself to not overthink. It feels like I do not have control of my own body. Do you guys feel nauseous from overthinking?,Depression
25555,I feel like trash to say the least. I dropped out of university last year I quit my job yesterday after only a month because I could not do it anymore I am severely depressed about this and everything else and it feels like everyone is screaming at me you are a failure you cannot do anything... and i feel like a burden to everyone. I am 24 now and I have accomplished nothing since I finished high school. I am so done I am on the verge of crying 247 and keep having nightmares. Everyone keeps telling me that life is hard for everyone and so on but that does not help me it just makes me more depressed. Can someone relate? I do not know what to do. I keep wishing I was dead but I do not want to kill myself because deep down I still have hope that someday I might find a life I am happy with. But I do not know how to get there I have no energy left in me. I feel so useless depressed and like a burden to everyone around me how do I continue from here?,Depression

It was a dinner party and there were about 12 people there most were female friends of his girlfriend and like 3 guys the whole night I felt so zoned out I felt horrible that I was not being friendly or talking to the others but I felt so faded the alcohol made it even worse. One of the guys remarked how I barely talked to anyone the whole night I felt crushed I gave the usual a xcuse of I am tired but it was difficult not to leave right away. I was the first to leave it felt like I was giving up officially I came home and cried.. yeah a 22yr old dude cried after a party I feel like I am just a loser and no matter how much I force myself I will always be a loser I give up even trying anymore I am tired of it.

Just need somewhere to be sad.,Depression
12541,If you are in a bad headspace please do not read this.I 22M am slowly starting to give up on life. I hoped things would get better but they have not and do not show any signs of changing. I am currently living at home with my verbally abusive mother in a very toxic environment. I want to move out aspa but I am working a shtty job that does not pay well and if I do save up enough. I would be broke for the foreseeable future. I have seen so many CV councillors and applied to so many jobs and despite all of that I have not been offered any interviews.To sum up my love life it has been pain. I have never had a partner or anything like that. Every now and again I match with someone we vibe and hit things off but after a date or two I get ghosted leaving me confused and hurt as to why they lost interest. I feel undesirable and unworthy of love. I feel like I need to be perfect in every way order to even be considered as a romatic partner. I feel the same way when it comes to job applications. it is mentally taxing and painful.All of this is having a massive effect on my mental health and I am noticing it deteriorating quickly. I hate that I am thinking about just ending it. But I guess I need to know when to quit I have struggled with knowing when to quit all my life. I guess I was always the hopeful optimist. But what is the point in trying when put all my efforts in trying to make my life better and I still end up in the same place. I keep telling myself be strong I hype myself up into a positive mindset and a good mood and for what? Nothing seems to change well nothing permanent. The cycle continues. It feels like everything is working against me and simple things that should be straight forward are not.And I get life's not fair and I accept that but it feels like the difficulty was dailed up to 1000 for me. I do not think anyone can save or help me. I have prayed and begged to whatever cosmic being might be out there. Praying for them to give me a break give me a win on which I can build on and make my life better. I do not know what I did to deserve this whether is this life or past or whatever but I am sorry.I have got so much unresolved pain.I know life has it is rough patches but I would at least like some level of happiness. It seems like life is moving by and I am still trying to fight my demons and move forwards.Honestly I am hesitant to kill myself but at the same time I am looking for a happy accident to relieve me of this pain. All I know is the longer I stay at home and working at the same job the closer I am to an early grave.I do not know how anyone would be able to help my situation and I do not know what to expect from writing this Reddit post but I need to let it out. Life is painful and I am tired of fighting,Depression

13186,Hi everyone I am new on this app but find it comforting that I am not alone. I have been in the blues for awhile now just cannot find anything to live for really. And what sucks most is I have everything. A loving and caring family a roof over my head and three meals a day. Clothes on my back and even extra. I find it pitiful that I feel this way I feel ashamed. Because people dream of the life I have people have is so so so much worse. I just graduated high school so I am in that weird phase where I really do not know what I want to do. I do not want to go to college because I do not want any debt but all of my friends are going. I phrased friends because I do not really talk to them anymore. I made the biggest mistake by giving my ex 100 of my time leaving none for my friends so I do not really blame them. I do not find joy in the stuff I used to do and I cannot find any joy elsewhere. All I do is work and good lord do I hate working. The day I find a job that I do not feel miserable at will be the best day ever. I hate that I feel like this because I should not at all. I hate that I am even writing this looking for sympathy for my little sorry ass. But I really do not know what else to do therapys not for me and if it were not for my mom and my coward self I would have put a bullet in my brain by now. But I know I have to keep on pushing because I could not live with my mom having her only son kill himself even if I was not alive. What to do,Depression

47299,How do you cope with friendsfamily that really know you and have seen you before depression diagnosis? Have you had a dear friend tell you that youre not doing well? Or say things like you should snap out of it youre not socializing and thats bad you took time to get better and youre getting worse your environment is unhealthy?Im struggling with depression and anxiety along with chronic back and neck pain. Im currently on temporary disability for the past five months. Ive been doing therapy with a therapist every week plus physical therapy. Im also on medication for depressionanxiety for over a year. My symptoms havent changed. Ive shared my heart with friends. And recently a friend told me that Ive been better in the past and that friendship is a two way road. It cant be one sided. This is true. I havent been to see her since she moved two hours away in November. We chat on video chat and text message several times a week. I am dealing with anxiety about traveling and going outside my house. Im working on it with a therapist and it is slow going. I love my friend dearly and I asked that we take a break from talking because her seeing me this way is difficult to watch friends words and its not healthy for me to feel bad about myself after chatting with her. Im reaching out to this community in hopes of finding support in a depressive state.,Depression

8152,New to posting here. On mobile so sorry for mistakes.I have 21F been struggling with depression for about 56 years now but I have not gotten an official diagnosis yet. I do not think my parents want to admit I have it but I know I do.I did not used to feel this way. I was a happy teen for the majority of it. Things only really started to decline when I was 16. I have had ups and downs but its remained pretty consistent. However its been getting worse and worse since 2019. Even before all this covid crap.I have a nice life. I have a loving family and two wonderful parents that I love very much and who love me very much. I have some pretty great siblings too. I have a wonderful and amazing boyfriend that I met online last year and who is going to come visit me in September unfortunately its a long distance relationship. I have a great best friend who I also met online and that I love very much. I have a good job it does not pay enough at all and its incredibly boring but the family I work for is wonderful and is the only reason I have stayed with it for 3 years. I should be happy. I have so many wonderful blessings. But I am not.I have only felt worse and worse with each passing month. The depressive episodes are only getting longer and harder to crawl out of. I never want to do anything I like to do anymore. I cannot get excited about things that usually make me happy anymore. I keep having awful nightmares about feeling trapped cornered and helpless but everyone around me says Ill be just fine.I know I am loved. I know I am worthy of love. But I just feel so tired and lonely and empty. I am so sick of life.Sorry for the rant. I just feel really bad tonight and I had to vent because no one else is online or around to talk to. Tired,Depression
47303,Why do I find the Spring so depressing? A lot of people talk about the Winter blues but for me Spring by far at least in recent years is painfully depressing. Its like the smell in the air mixed with the temperature and longerbrighter daytime present this fake sense of happiness. Its as if when Im outside things seem too happy and that scent in the air is gutwrenchingly nostalgic of a pasttime that can never be felt or experienced again. Because Im not capable of it and Im too worndown to anyway. I actually remember when I was little 29 now that I loved clear sunny weather. I looked up the forecast almost obsessively ahead of time banking on those days of where there are no clouds to block the sun. Not even partly cloudy. Its perplexing to think I was once like this since nowadays I despise sunny weather. I genuinely feel better and more comfortable when it is cloudy with rain. Especially the eccentric types of weather where it looks as if nighttime has arrived too early but instead its just a storm brewing. Not to mention I am at my peak mindset and performance late at night. What the hell happened.,Depression
22734,I am constantly in a state of existential dread. I feel like I am going to die or the earth will first do nothing matters. It makes it hard to find desire for anything because it all seems pointless. It does not help that I am terrified of dying its not that I want to die I just wish I was never alive. Does anyone struggle with existential dread daily? I feel like it takes over all my thoughts all the time Existential Dread,Depression

19228,I have been diagnosed with depression before tried antidepressants saw a therapist regularly for years. There were times I was skeptical but most of the time I knew I was depressed. Now I am not certain. When I am alone I can get really down and wish I ceased to exist. I think how I am sick of dealing with medical issues working a meaningless job doing the same thing day in and day out and feeling absolutely worthless. But there are moments that I feel really happy alive excited. I laugh so gleefully at the animal posts on Reddit. I get really into good movies. My positive mood surprises me because how could I have been thinking I feel like I am doing loved ones a favor by staying alive because I really do not care to live one minute and then be thinking I am so happy that animals are so cute the next. This confuses me because I thought I am really in a funk and may need to find some help but maybe its just in certain situations that I feel like that and I can still find joy in life.Its been extremely difficult to find a good therapist. It was difficult before when I could have in person sessions but I do not know how to even relate or open up to someone remotely. So I have not been trying.. Is this depression?,Depression
12005,Hey guys! My partner recently 2 months ago suffered a bit of a nervous breakdown for want of a better phrase. He was on citalopram for about 4 years previous to this and in January he started to slowly come off it tapering the dose very gradually over the next few months until he got down to 10mg. At this point he hit a total low and got a shock so jumped himself back up to 30mg not the best idea but he panicked. A few weeks later is when he suffered his mental breakdown the weeks prior being full of mood swings irritable quick to anger irrational thinking etc etc. Eventually it got too much. The crisis team got involved and the doctor decided that citalopram probably was not the best thing for him anymore so switched him to mirtazapine crosstitrating it with cit for the first couple of weeks 8 weeks ago. After a couple of weeks they dropped his cit completely and upped his dose of mit to 30mg from 15mg. Its been 6 weeks since this point. At first he seemed to be getting better but about 4 weeks ago started suffering massively with depressive episodes suicidal thoughts extreme paranoia effecting our relationship obsessive thoughts total irrational thinking an inability to keep the bad thoughts in quick to anger what he calls brain tizziness which is a physical feeling apparently tunnel vision all the rest you name it. Hes really struggling and is at the point where hes getting really distressed and upset at the thought that hes the only person who has ever been through this and worried that it will never get better or maybe that hes crazy. He was discharged from the crisis team 2 weeks ago but I fear that was too earlyI was wondering if anyone here has had such horrific side effects for so long?

14076,My parents struggled with infertility for 8 years until I was born my brother was born in the next year. For the first few years of my life everything was fine. At the age of 12 my father started complaining about the expenses for feeding us and how the water and electricity bills were killing him. He basically complains everytime he has to buy us dinner or go grocery shopping. My mother blames us for forcing her to be a stay at home mom to take care of us. And I am like ???? you CHOSE to have us you should have calculated your finances to see whether you could afford to have children BEFORE having us. We never asked for you to make sacrifices for us. All this could be avoided if you two were just content with being infertile. Basically all I am hearing everyday is them complaining about the cost of raising us and all I want to say is buddy I am not overjoyed at being your child either. I wished you never had me too. How can people be so irresponsible as too not calculate their finances to see if they will be able to afford children and blame everything on the child after having them. I have thought that it was my fault when I was young for needing to eat and bathe cuz it cost them money I even stopped eating for a while but now that I am older and I think about it. WHAT THE HELL??!! Just do not have me if you cannot afford it. Man parents can be so dumb sometimes. I got depression cuz of my parents,Depression

7337,I have been obsessed with the same girl for almost 20 years and everyone else I like I instantly fall in love with. I cannot act on anything because I think I am worthless.Not like any of these feelings are real they are just my brain trying to extract love and positive feelings from someplace since I do not get it from anywhere else. I wish I was dead I am too full of love,Depression
15386,TLDR Chronically bored if that is a thing. I am doing perfectly alright. If I look at my life from the outside I would say I am kind of an easygoing overachiever. Somehow I have cracked the formula to breeze through my academic and professional life with the least effort. This effort I am talking about itself is not out of laziness or arrogance not completely at least but out of sheer boredom. I guess I am making this post because frankly I have got nothing better to do. Somehow my uninterested ass always seems to get decent friends who look out for me and call me to fun events. I do not blame them a bit for it because they know I would do the same for them. But I do not fucking enjoy anything beyond a point. it is always been like this and always will be. For a long time I like an idiot thought that I must be super smart. Maybe that is the reason I do not relate to anything. This juvenile line of thought thankfully ended when I came across smarter more hard working peers in college and the workplace who put me right in my place. I am digressing a bit. So soon I figured out that I am just an average arrogant dumbass whose arrogance got cured a little bit in a healthy manner. But that led to the next question. Then why am I still so bored? I have tried various things to help with this. Forced myself to work on projects forced myself to go out forced myself to do relatively well and heck I have even forced myself to a healthy lifestyle of vegetarian diet daily exercise and meditation. do not get me wrong here I did see some proper benefits out of all of them but soon my old curse of sensing routine got into me and I eventually stopped. That is still fine. I know I will get back to doing good things again soon when my brain gets it shit right its cyclical but again as you may have already noticed I know I will get bored. So what do I do? I have changed academic tracks out of boredom changed routines out of boredom heck I even changed my professional track out of boredom. I have done open mics out of boredom unashamedly hit on girls at the bar out of boredom came up with a serious start up plan too thanks to boredom lol. Right now I think I might just take up exercise again so that one day I can go rockclimbing. But that engagement will also be momentary sadly. I will probably do one easy rock and then come back to my routine bored self. Perhaps I will take up photography when I am 45. Get a fucking Harley to get away from my wife and kids not there yet but probably will be owing to normal human routine but soon get bored of the Harley and dump that poor shit. So ending this shitfest of a post let me say I am probably not depressed. I am definitely not lonely and I am definitely not a very good writer either lol. Just was in a bad headspace right now so made this post. Thanks to any kind soul who read this whole thing. I am doing alright.,Depression
23741,I realized that accepting bad things that happen to you is better than becoming rebellious because you have to face even more consequences and you always when you lose.Sometimes trying is not enough just ignoring or swallowing down your thoughts seems more pleasant.With this post I announce that I give up being a fighter because it is useless anyway. Accepting,Depression
47146,My every day battle Im constantly battling with myself day after day Im kinda get sick of beating myself up over not being good enough for me. Im working hard but I dont feel like Im working hard enough on myself even the way I feel like I need to. Ive gotten off my meds but sometimes it feels like a relapse. Its made my taste in music change things I used to love I dont enjoy anymore friends I dont really connect with many anymore even the people I used to see I dont see any more. My connections seem to be gone.The constants in my life there is maybe 4 of my job my family my friends and where I live. Emotionally Im not well. Physically Im doing better so one thing at a time I guess. Fighting with myself I dont want to do it constantly.,Depression
24674,Kind of an update of that one post when I was feeling like quitting college sooner this year. I kind of got through my final year and took my final exams only for me to fail. I thought that I would feel better with that whole college thing behind me but nos it just feels worse because I feel like I wasted 4 years and thousands in student loans for nothing. I do not feel motivated by anything anymore and nothing really improved. I lost all my passion and all I do is letting myself rot in my bed all day. My family mostly thinks about how much they wasted by helping me paying off my college fees instead caring for my personal career opportunities and I just feel like everyone is letting me down since I am one of the few who failed. I have no more will to do anything nor to see anyone and I even keep avoiding my roomate so I do not have any kind of human interaction because I am just a big ball of angst and do not want to project it on anyone also because people are just a pain in the ass tbh.Now the best summer of my life is beginning by me feeling guilt and angst because of college and all my plans getting aborted because of sudden financial issues and me leaving the only small trip that made me feel a bit less stressed out because of health issues and more fees yay.I do not really know how to feel motivated to do anything again and I just cannot get over that angst and disappointment feeling. Failed at college and is now feeling even worse,Depression
8541,I have tried to change life around a bit. I could be the richest guy on the planet but I would still be couped up in my head all the time being scared of the world. I fucking hate my life and I will always have suicide as my friend if I need them. there is just no changing anything,Depression

16100,I am going through so much i have no one to. Is anyone available to talk? I need help,Depression
26812,I finally went to see a psychotherapist after years of struggling and the conversation was really nice. I mean it was quite basic he asked me if I wanted to talk freely or if he should ask away and I chose the latter but still even just talking to someone who is nonjudgmental and not so reactive towards possibly disturbing things I might say was liberating. Right at the start I told him I was suffering from depression but after talking for just a bit he quickly crossed thatpossibility out saying that I did not have the most prominent symptoms being lack of sleep most importantly among other things. Apparantly sleeping well and too much is a disqualifier lol. In the end he did diagnose me with a reoccurent depressive disorder I dunno if that is the correct term in English on paper even though he said I am 'just' fatigued so I am confused. However the main thing I wanted to say is that I just do not know how I feel about this if I count on his words and not the final diagnosis?. I should feel relieved but if I am not depressed what makes me the mess I am? What makes me apathetic and hurt for no apparent reason? I cannot shoulder the responsibilty for 'failing' in life so far yet. it is too much without the 'excuse' of being depressed. To top it this was my biggest fear ever since I suspected I might be depressed in my teenage years.. That I might just be this way that everything I was going through was just me my personality. I finally embraced and accepted that I was depressed years along the way and often realized just how fucked up my mind is when others reacted strongly to random small things I said seeing in what dark place my mind was. Maybe I am just lazy and cannot grow the fuck up. I should have asked him if he was clearly diagnosing me with depression or what. Or is there a difference I do not know about? He also said that I should meet with a specialist for gastroenterology for my iron deficiency and emphasized that many women apparently suffer from the kind of symptoms I do just from the deficiency. I have experienced severe anemia before and I have had barely acceptable iron stats for years although I do take supplements whenever it dips too low and have that checked every year which my doctor for that does not take it half as serious... Anyway even though I came out confused I rode the high of having achieved seeking help which I have been putting off for ages. And as I said before just talking openly was really nice and I feel like I got lucky to actually like the first professional I met with having heard that many need to switch a few times before finding someone they click with. Even though I cannot go back there as there are no capacities in my city for the demand there is apparently. Please go seek therapy if you need it. Everybody can benefit from it not just us depressed folks. So yeah if anybody actually read this far have a nice daynight I wish you well. Just me rambling about my experience in one first therapy session,Depression
23032,The reason I am posting this is in rdepression is that NOBODY in any other place understands.Everybody asks well what are your interests?. Any nobody understands I have been depressed for 13 years! Since I was 13. I am anhedonic and I have no interests! For years I tried so hard to find an interest anything! But my brain just does not have any interests other than sleeping browsing reddit watching youtube.So I am asking here. But other than programmingIT is there any profession that you can teach yourself? Thanks! I graduated a few years ago but I really really hate my field. And I am not willing to go back to university since I hated it so so so much I am autistic so it was hell for me. But I am great at teaching myself is there any profession other than programmingIT that I can teach myself?,Depression

19836,I have been getting more and more depressed over the past few months about this to the point that every conversation with my mother turns into an argument or screaming match because to be quite frank I cannot stand her as a person but she barely works because of medical reasons has no support system other than me and I care about her enough that I cannot leave her on the streets. I pay for all the bills including rent in a shitty duplex we have lived in since I was in high school that has so many problems but considering I am the only one paying bills I cannot afford anything better. It would literally be cheaper and more freeing to be living with an actual roommate that splits the cost of everything instead of my mother who pays for nothing but I cannot.To top it all off she is smothering. She gets offended if I do not want to spend every waking minute not at work talking to her and will cry and throw fits if I just want to be by myself. She treats me like I am 16 rather than 30 and paying all her bills and literally throwing my life away to make sure that she has a place to live.I am just so depressed. I have no time for me. I rarely go out because my friends all think I am weird for living at home and fuck trying to have a romantic relationship. My life is essentially over until she either dies or I win the lottery and I hate thinking that but its the truth. Idk. I am sad and had to get this off my chest. Thanks all. 30 and still stuck living at home with my financially and mentally unstable mother.,Depression
24523,I am honestly just going to start deleting all my social media and go back to isolating myself like I fucking constantly do. Why should I even try to be proud of myself for hard work that I do when others do not even get the fucking point I am done trying to love myself or even live up to anyone's standards. I am fucking sick of my own envy and hate I am sick of always being angry I am sick that when ever I finally start talking about my problems some asshole says someone always has it worse than you look on the bright side almost like my problems do not fucking matter.I am done.. I just fucking give up and In all honesty I will just start drinking again I am fucking done from now on...,Depression

9964,I thought depression was something that could go away again but now I am starting to realize that it probably never gets better actually the best you can hope for is a zombiestatelife on medication where you cannot feel any euphoria from movies music etc. When you get older you just lose your ability to feel profound emotions from stuff? I am only 22 but i feel like i have already experienced this decline since i was 1415 when i started to feel really depressed. it is been 78 years now and the only thing that made life worth living for me was smoking weed and being high 247 which you can only do for so long. Now I am back to being sober because weed was driving me completely insane and was having panic attacks everyday and i feel completely depressed every single day wanting to kill myself. I cannot even get on medications because i accidentally told my doctor about my former weed habit so they want me to be 6 months sober before prescribing any medication. I just wanted to ask in here does it get better? is it a real thing or is it just a myth.Otherwise I am ready to kill myself honestly because I am not going to fight a losing battle any longer. Does it ever get better?,Depression
24067,Using an old throwaway account. I am 33 located in the US and I have had anxiety issues for quite a long time. I should have started therapy when I was 18. Recently I have been trending much more towards depression and I NEED to address it now. My questions areHow do I find a therapist?What is the average cost? I created an account for my insurances website to see my plan and it does not look like they cover it at all.There are different types of therapy? How can I tell what type of therapist to use?I am sure I will think of more but I am having a hard time concentrating. Like I said anxiety issues up the wazoo. Had them for most of my life but I think it got much worse after a bad salvia trip around 10 years ago but that is not important. I have an extremely hard time discussing and articulating my emotions. The last few weeks I began having intrusive thoughts about suicide hello hotline bot I am safe now but I like that you are here anyway. I have most definitely also lost interest in the things in my life that brought me joy and the past week my appetite has gotten markedly lower. So yeah depression. A little over a week ago I had a yearly physical but I guess my answers to their mental health questionnaire did not raise any alarms and I was scared to ask how to go about starting therapy.On to my little rant at the start of April a coworker invited me out to get drinks and we hit it off amazingly. I am actually one of her supervisors so we had to keep it hush hush at work. Texted constantly for the first few weeks neither of us had felt that kind of connection to someone else before. Conversation that flowed from one topic to the next from getting out of work at 5 or 6 until going to bed around 1. We also saw each other outside of work at least every other day. That pace kept up for about a month maybe got a little slower through May.By June we were seeing each other less and while texting nearly every day we are talking much less and I feel my apprehension to discussing my feelings is the because. I care deeply about her and I do not want to lose her because I am unable to talk seriously about us. Add to that having to see her at work every day and I am a mess of emotions which have really boiled over the last couple days. It was my birthday on Saturday and I spent most of it crying in my room dreading having to respond to the birthday wishes I was receiving. This evening I asked her when I could see her next and did not get a reply. Four hours later I asked if we could talk and was again met with silence. I am not the type to incessantly send messages hoping to annoy or guilt someone into responding so I left it at that but in the words of Tom Petty the waiting is the hardest part. I do not know what exactly I am looking to accomplish with this post. I have a good amount of friends but I do not have a best friend that I can confide in and talk to about things like this. I am just a mess of a human right now and I think my brain is trying to go in so many directions that I cannot even have a good cry even though I think that is what I want in this moment. Questions about starting therapy and a little rant,Depression
18682,i should preface this by stating that I am going into my senior year of high school for context.after an incredibly long job hunt 7 months I have finally gotten a job. which do not get me wrong is great. unemployed i felt so burdensome and unproductive. most of all i felt guilty. I have placed all my worth these past months on getting a job and my license and now i have them. but instead of feeling accomplished or happy i just feel empty. what now? I have reached my goal. there is nothing more for me. I have tried congratulating myself for reaching these milestones even looking at myself in the mirror as i say it out loud. but it means nothing if i do not really mean it. for me the reward of finally achieving something this important is to find something equally as important to replace it with. basically there is no reward.all i can ever think about is how much i cannot wait to die. i feel real genuine excitement for it. there is some fear surrounding dying since its the fear of the unknown. but my yearning for it greatly out weighs any anxiety. its not necessarily that i want to die as a direct result of my depression. my medication has actually greatly improved my mood over the past year and a half. but it just feels like playing a game in which you get virtually no reward for completing long and arduous tasks. i do not want to play that game anymore.I am always so so tired. I just want to sleep and not have to think about anything. please do not be concerned. I am not going to kill myself anytime soon. i will know the time that i am truly considering killing myself since I have experienced it before and this is not the time. i promise if i do i will seek help early before i try anything. i just wanted to vent. I have achieved my goal and now i have no ambitions.,Depression
15021,Some people do not realize therapy and counselling does not fix or help depression. I do have anger issues but that is only because the ignorance of others. No therapist can fix or help my depression as its a chemical imbalance. I posted saying I am tired of people preaching therapy then got a ton of people say otherwise. I hate people. Ill be glad when I leave this earth. Fuck everybody,Depression
14913,In my last post I complained about how rude he is in everything he does. Now I am beginning to understand exactly WHY! When his wife was alive she had control over EVERYTHING. He had very little if any control at all. So in the scant few years he says he has left he is trying to make up for 47 years of being someone who always did as he was told. here is the issue nothing I do is good enough for him. Except maybe the physical things he cannot do at all anymore. For example yardwork. Anything my wife or I do around here he goes behind us and quietly second guesses. If the cat is outside he insists he knows about it! I asked why? One of us let her out one of us will let her back in. Nope. Not good enough for him! He goes out onto the concrete porch on very shaky legs in clumsy slippers and down the brick steps to get her. Why? You guessed it! He has to control the cat too!! If any of you have ever had a cat or two you are all aware that cats do as they please! When we moved in here he insisted we change anything we did not like after all this will be our house soon then when we talk about changing anything or buying something new he scoffs! IDK why your going to waste money on a new TV when this 28 year old 19 box TV is just fine! Oh you mean the one with the lousy picture that you always complain about having to get up to see the program guide because you cannot see it? THAT perfectly fine TV? I mention to him that we are getting a new kitchen trash can because the one he has is not designed to hold trash. We have no room for it in the kitchen and...you guessed it! The old one is perfectly fine! Plenty of room for it and the old one is NOT perfectly fine! We want to replace the shades with blinds he says why? the old ones are perfectly fine! Not true. Every one of them is torn and the springs are shot. My wife his daughter hung out his humming bird feeder. We went and bought a second one and since my wife cannot get on a ladder nor can I she mounted it in a lower area. Day before yesterday he had dragged out the ladder to climb up and put the feeder up higher. He was wearing house slippers and his robe. He could have fallen and at his age that would be the end. oh I almost forgot the most important part. The lower feeder was not HIS idea. that is why he wanted to move it. He wanted us here so badly and said do whatever you want but is now regretting saying it. Why? Because he is not in charge. We have had to be careful when we go food shopping because he has talked about how much he misses driving. He has trouble hearing we almost have to yell to get a point across he cannot see the cat his phone his walker etc when they right in front of him! No way he is going to drive! All that being said can someone please explain to me how a 94 year old man has such a fucking obsession with being in control? You would think his chief priority would be staying alive as long as he can! He frustrates the shit out of me that pisses me off and then I get so depressed that I want to sleep all day! In any event thanks for reading my rant. Hope all is well. Love and an awesome day to everyone! So says the Godfather! LOL Controlling,Depression
9067,I am angry and sad I want to scream and cry. I want to hurt myself or break something. I just cannot fucking handle this.I hate the fact that I am STILL waiting on therapy. Originally I was waiting to hear about scheduling. Then I learned that no counselors could handle my scheduleI work till 7pm monFri. So my supervisor said make it work no matter what. I opened my schedule but I think I am not going to hear anything back from them.I just need some way to cope with all these emotions. I want to be able to cope and I used to think I could but now that I am getting hit from every direction I realize all I can do to handle it is break down and hurt myself. I promised I would not do it again and now I just do not know what to do.I tried watching some YouTube I tried smoking my vape. I would considering trying to play some games but I will probably punch my laptop. If I go for a walk I will end up punching a wall and will make my work life harder since I need hands. I even considered writing some poetry but all that is coming to my head is FUUUCK I want to do something I will regret. cannot even jerk off because I am porn free now and if I use my imagination I would probably rip my dick off. So now I am sitting here numb but feeling all of this at once. I am just scrolling reddit not even reading the posts. I can barely feel my arms. I am considering going out and getting a 6pack but I am afraid if I use it to cope once I will use it to cope over and over again and I will end up a sad lonely drunk and then I will actually try to kill myself.I have got nothing right now I cannot even talk to my friends about this because there is secretsnot mine they cannot know. Even if I talked to someone they would probably not understand and try to twist things around or argue what actually happened. I do not need that I just need to feel better. My head is just so fucking noisy,Depression
13011,Every day I just go about it zoned out I cannot focus on anything I cannot enjoy anything for more than a minute or twoLogically I know I have enough. Someone who loves me a fairly stable life but I do not feel anything. I throw on whatever face makes things go most smoothly and go ahead with another day of this fucking awful purgatory I do not remember the last time I had any sort of aspiration in life. Honestly I hope I just get hit by a bus or get spiced up by an unruly outlet so I do not have to keep doing this but I am not going to be too optimistic about it. Idk. I do not see things getting better I do not see myself trying to make things better. Not going to self delete because Id rather not suffer guess its purgatory forever. I feel empty. I have nothing I want nothing,Depression
7632,Please do not lecture me I feel bad enough as it is.I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety approximately 14 years ago. For a long time I did well. And then about 10 years ago I started to slip again. Change of meds going off going back on and multiple changes of jobs because most of them have been temporary.For quite a while at different jobs no matter how good it is I start calling in sick. I get migraines so sometimes that is the problem. But sometimes I just cannot get up. It feels too much to go to work.I do not know why I do it. Its ruining my life. Id like to work and have an income.How do I get over this? Calling in sick all the time,Depression

She helped me through so much thing. I cannot even breathe,Depression

9321,I have had depressionanxiety symptoms since I was a teenager. I just kept telling myself that as soon as X happens then maybe I will enjoy life again. I am 35 now been through therapy on medication and my feelings are still not changing. I do not really like anything anymore except for self harming behaviors. Every time I leave my house it is a chore. I have all my needs met a job I do not hate even a life partner. However I still wish to go to sleep and never wake up. When will I feel like my life is worth living? When I am 40 50 70?! It seems a cruel joke that I have now roped in my SO into a life I never really wanted in the first place. I just cannot remember ever feeling like I belong here and at this point I do not know that I will. Ok but when does it get better?,Depression
14552,I think I am done and just ready to give up. I keep trying just to be ignored so what is the point? .,Depression
11157,I have had depression anxiety PTSD and a host of other issues my whole life and I thought I was doing pretty well. Mid twenties now and I made a lot of mistakes that have just left me reeling. I have gone from being engaged to my best friend with an apartment and a job I love and career ideas to just... Sleeping all the time feeling sorry for myself. My job is one that like... If I did not get out of bed to do I would hate myself even more? So that is not a problem but. I just repeatedly ask myself what the point of me is wanting to die but not actually taking steps towards it. Just chilling on the metaphorical bridge. Therapy has not helped. My meds have not helped. I do not hate people around me I barely hate anything but myself but I am not really interested in a lot of the people in my life or that I try connecting with. The few that I am are so different from me that it is not something I could maintain. Despite being nonbinary and bi I regularly feel I am cis and get and pretending. I am in a healthy weight range and people like me but they are not people I like and I feel incredibly unhealthy all the time. And the kicker for it all is I am a suicide hotline operator. I spend forty hours a week trying to just like. Do what little I can manage to help people or do some good out there and as a result calling the lines myself is like. The biggest eye roll most of the time. So it is like what do I even do from here that I have not done already? Rhetorical. I am not going to die anytime soon though I wish I could so I am just. Stuck. A year post ruining my life.,Depression
27193,so for awhile I have not been yk 100 its been like that for years but two years ago is when everything kind of pushed me over the edge. I do not mean to get all daddy issues here but two years ago I saw my dad for the first time in six years the circumstances on why I had to see him were not the best but who cares. The days prior leading up to seeing him again Id have panic attacks it stressed me out thinking about him it made me really tired and just did not feel like doing anything anymore and when I saw him I blanked out. I met my younger half brothers absolutely love them. A few weeks after is when shit started sinking in and it became overwhelming for me I started attending school one day a week or not at all Id have multiple panic attacks outside the school gate or silent breakdowns in my room and learning the things he did made me despise him. I could not bring myself to do things anymore. since then I have lost a bunch of people I once called friends I dropped out this year at 17 and have no fucking clue what to do with my life I am going to be seeing him again in a couple days and I honestly do not know what to think or how to feel I am just scaredtired and alone Tired T,Depression
40212,so i m starting to reach the point of getting rid of thing i own that way no one else ha to do that i don t really want to be in this mood but i don t see why i should bother trying anymore i m at the point where i can t hide how miserable i am and i don t want people to tell me it will get better or that i ve come such a long way i feel like i m holding those people back and they re wasting their energy on me i m not scared of dying anymore even though all i want is to not feel like garbage,Depression
8456,so I would just like to ask a favour of some people. I want to ask my Mum if I can go and see a therapist so can somebody please just tell me some things that I could say to try and persuade my Mum to let me see a therapist at my local doctors? I was thinking of some of the good times of my childhood where I was not screaming and crying internally. Where I was laughing with joy instead of my own pain. Where I was not self harming myself. They were good times... Hey,Depression
23830,I have been depressed since I was 7. Major trauma does that to you. And I have tried to commit suicide 7 times 3 before I was 10 4 after. But I am 'highfunctioning.' I can do the things people expect me to do get good grades win competitions act happy and sometimes even be happy. But I cannot get myself to brush my teeth take a shower change my clothes or care about my personal hygiene when no one is watching. I am still depressed and I have been diagnosed with depression.So here is my problem my parents do not believe me. They say I am faking it that it gets better or that this is normal and everyone goes through it. So I cannot take meds I am 17. How do I convince them that this is a problem. That I am depressed not because people will pay attention but because I am? And since most people I know just disregard my depression and say the same things as my parents I am starting to not believe myself. Am I faking it? Maybe I am Faking It,Depression
47769,advice for helping my friend might delete later in case they see this I dont think theyre a Reddit user but just in case. I really need advice on how to help my friend. I thought it would be easy since Ive struggled with depression for about 3 years now but I just cant find the words to give any helpful advice. Im really worried about them and theyre addicted to a few things though they dont think that they have a problem so Im scared that whatever I say or do is going to make it worse especially since they often talk about wanting to commit suicide. All I want is to help them but they often stop talking about it once I start to sound worried. There isnt anyone else that I can ask for help at this point so Im hoping to maybe get some advice from here. Sorry if this is kind of vague I really dont want them to find out.,Depression

7612,I have been forgetting things. I feel stupid. I do things on time and then there are mistakes in them because of my forgetfulness. I am easily overwhelmed. I come across as careless. I switched medications earlier this year but I think it is gotten worse because of that.I would fire me. I am tired of myself. I complete a task but inevitably something is off about it no matter how many times I check. I have been at this job for several years and got a warning last year improved but now have fallen again.What the fuck is wrong with me?

21837,so after being seriously depressed for months to the point of using alcohol to cope and going through a couple of depressive episodes for at least a year if not longer coupled with low self esteem and almost if not no self worth for as long ad i can remember i finally decided i needed to get help. However i did not have a primary care doctor so i booked an appointment with a pcp to specifically talk about my mental health to talk about actions to take and discuss how I have been feeling. after asking me several assessment questions again this was the entire point of the visit she told me she believes i have anxiety and depression and prescribed me low dose zoloft. The first night I had terrible anxiety and could not sleep. last night was a little better but still i could not sleep. Today was particularly bad. My mind started racing and i was incredibly depressed for about 3 hours after taking it and had some pretty dark thoughts. i was in bed in the dark and that did not help so i tried watching a funny show and playing video games. not even 10 minutes into both of those activities and i lost interest. i finally decided i needed to do something so i decided to bake and cook dinner. i still felt horrible and i started panicking scared i was just going to continue to be sad and be depressed forever. i sat there worried i had too much time on my hands and i was going to be sad all that time.i do not have work until later in the day the bext two days again still having dark thoughts. after reaching out to a couple people and getting affirmations from them i started saying out loud that i am worthy and that i do not deserve to feel like this and that i will get better and live a long good life. and that it does not matter if everyone else thinks I am worthless i know i am worthy. i am worthy of getting better. and i will. i repeated this to myself for about 2030 minutes and it completely lifted my mood. i feel so much better. I am apprehensive to get too excited though because I am worried its just a side effect of the medication I have only been on it for 3 days and that it will wear off. I am hoping that is not the case though because it feels good to feel more normalps. yes. I do plan on seeking therapy. Improvement? Or just a side affect of medication?,Depression
47680,Life makes me feel so tired You go out into the world because you have to. You spend the whole day trying to muster the energy to be social and push past your social anxiety. You know you still don't have the sufficient social skills or enthusiasm about life necessary to be attractive to women but you persist with this life anyways trying to learn what you can from the men you see around you who seem happy able to confidently express themselves who bring good vibes who have something to say and are interesting. And then inevtiably you look at where you are in life. What you know what you are like. You are trying to change but it's not working really. You try to have a real interest and love for things in this world but it is not coming naturally. Due to whatever mental or developmental reason you constantly forget about the things you try to learn about. Moat of your brainpower is being used trying your hardest to be socially acceptable and not seen as an awkward teenager in an adult's body. Constantly thinking about self presentation and body language always knowing that it is your outward presentation that largely impacts your opportunities in life.And at the end of the work day you come home. You are exaughsted but your job doesn't pay well. So you are supposed to use the time after work to study and work towards a better future. But you feel beaten down and tired when you get home. You can barely muster the energy to work out. If you do it takes forever because you are tired and you can't focus. And if you are me a day spent among the socially competent and likable is enough to send you into a negative thought spiral. Googling about how to improve social skills feeling tired when you read about what you have to do. You are already tired. It is a compounding tiredness. You know it isn't your sleep or your diet. Both of those are in check. It's just life. A life that you are having trouble with feeling enthusiastic about in the first place.Every day the nagging thought that you will always be alone is ever present in the back of your mind. You can't stop thinking about those women who you did not have a choice but be attracted to romantically. Not in a very heavy way. They were just someone you actually wanted to shoot your shot with. And you know you failed with these women. And during the time you knew them you sat and watched as the aforementioned likable charismatic men of the world easily swooned them entertained them freely loved them and their love was accepted. And you look at that and see that you are not like them. You will never be like those men. You can try every day to painstakingly get there.You can try as hard as you can to relax and be a fun person to be around but you never quite reach that state of being. You often wonder if you are not mentallycognitively capable of being like those men. And you realize that all of this is making you tired still. In addition to feeling essentially doomed to be alone in this world you are confronted with it's relentless challenges and you wonder what is the point of it all? Is this life worth living? Is there a reason to smile when you are the kind of person that you are in this world and you can't seem to really change despite your absolute best effort which you painstakingly put in every day only to return to the same sad tired state at the end of the day? It's difficult to get excited for life when you feel socially incapable and generally unlovable. When you feel unable to bring value to other people as a friend as a companion.Another day wasted. A day of work is to be followed by a day of work towards a better life for which there doesn't seem to be any energy. My mind is tortured with the thought that I am not fundamentally a good enough person to be with. This thought never goes away. I will always be alone.,Depression
12466,I guess you could say I have been going through it a bit recently I tend to distance myself from people during this time instead of talking about anything to anyone. I have found that recently whenever any of my friends vent or unload their problems to me it triggers me and causes me to selfharm.I guess I need to work more on my communication skills because I typically do not ever make my needs or boundaries very clear to anyone. But sometimes I find it very difficult to tell people that I cannot be there for them when they are clearly in a crisis. I also hold back from opening up to my friends because in a way I know how it affects me when others do it and would not wish the same on them. And it sometimes seems like me telling them that I feel overwhelmed also feels like me unloading? How can I possibly bring it up without feeling like a hypocrite? Just some thoughts going through my head right now.I am just curious as to if anyone else is experiencing something similar andor has any advice or even support. Thank you so much for reading lt3 TW My sh is triggered by my friends,Depression
14281,So just to let you know where my head is at these days Ill tell you about myself. I am 23M. My childhood was physically and emotionally abusive and I was neglected for a long time. The older I get I can see how this stuff has messed with me and how its always been messing with me and the way I socialize with people. I met my dad when I was 18 and he knew how my mom was but he did not want anything to do with me and my sister but he raised our half sister and gave her a great life. I never wanted to have kids and I was with this girl for 3 years and she begged me not to wear a condom said and that she was on birth control and I believed her and now she is pregnant and I am almost certain that its my daughter. She was born in April I think. I do not know her name or where she is. My ex just went crazy when she found out she was pregnant and she got back with her ex and she will not communicate with me at all. So that is what is been going on in my life. Then I met this girl and started talking to her and she seemed to really like me and I really liked her a lot too. But all my anxiety and stuff was messing with me. When someone says something good to me I cannot believe its true for some reason and I feel like things are going to get real bad. This girl is becoming a counselor and she just seemed like the girl that came right out of my dreams. We were going out and having a real good time and then I did not hear from her one day and I got real nervous and had an anxiety attack. I feel so stupid for getting like that and getting attached but I was real nervous and did not want to wait around for her to open my snap so I text her and told her how I felt and that I hope she was not ignoring me and that she can just tell me anything. She text back and was sorry but I said a lot of stupid stuff for it being that early to talk to someone. This went on for another three weeks just being like warm and not like it was before when she was sending hearts and saying good morning sweetheart and saying she loved this and that about me. So these past three weeks just killed me because she said she still wanted to get together and that everything was okay. Anyways I feel like that was too overwhelming for me and I told her how I felt and she started talking and said she was afraid it would not work out because we live like two hours away and she really wanted to be with means that she knew I was attached and she was too but she was afraid it would not work out and that she could not be what I wanted right now. I feel so stupid and I feel like I ruined things. I think I have jus got so much going on these days its already hard for me to function as it is and I was so happy to be talking to this girl it just sucks and I hate myself. I embarrassed myself so bad and ruined something that could have been great.,Depression
9003,NAME?,Depression
17915,I was not like a crazy alcoholic or anything just partying with my friends too much to avoid my anxiety. I am turning 23 next week and I feel like such a loser. I am in college for 3D modelling and animation and live with my parents. This week the girl I was seeing ended it and I also got rejected for a job I really wanted after multiple interviews. I have plenty of friends but I just feel more lonely around them. All I do is exercise to cope but I get home and feel like dying.Sorry this rant is all over the place just needed to like SAY IT such a shitty first week of sobriety,Depression
15469,there is no point to this but I just need to vent I used to be fun funny flirty and kind of cocky even. Women loved me. Almost any date I went on women were telling me to spend the night after just a few hours. That was before I lost my careerfriendsdreamspassion for lifemotivation I met 4 different girls off tinder this month. Every single one told me they were not interested. No sex. No kiss. No romantic interest at all. And I do not blame them. I am not me anymore. I never thought I could ever miss myself but I do. I miss the old me. My whole personality is different I have no idea who I am Its making me undatableunfuckable,Depression
12654,I feel completely devoid of all emotion. I do not know if its my mood stabilisers or anti depressants but I literally could not give a single fuck about anything. I just want to sitlie down all day alone not talking to anyone and not seeing anyone. I have no thoughts no motivation to do anything. People say go out and do something you will feel better but I do not feel better I feel worse. I spend the whole time I am out just wanting to go back home to my safe bubble where I can be alone and not have to hold a conversation. I am sick of trying to pretend I give a fuck because I do not. I am filled with dread every time I think I might have to interact with someone making excuses to people why they cannot come over. I have been this way for 11 years god knows I have tried I have had therapy I take my medication every single day but it does not work. Nothing works. The only time I am happy is when I am asleep I just want to sleep forever. I have no feelings. Just want to sleep and be left alone.,Depression
39278,i ve been dealing with some really weird painful burning throughout my abdomen and my entire middle the last few week i don t know if anxiety is the culprit but it definitely make it ten time worse doe anyone have way to reduce the effect of psychosomatic symptom,Depression
17532,I have made a diary for my battling of the void within me. Please check it out as I could use support and fellow peers as a community.crossing the bridge 36 yo alcoholic needing support,Depression
15249,Honest. Not trying whine. I literally have no one else to talk to. I really am just over it. I have two out of four of my girls that I am hanging around for. My oldest just had an attitude all the time. I get it you are 20. My 18 year old is disabled. So most of her care falls on me. Totally fine with. My 17 year old is a narcissistic brat and lives with my parents in another state. My 9 year old is so young. All my kids have great qualities about each of them. My husband and I have been married 22 years this year. And he absolutely hates me I feel. I love him. But he has never been sweet to me since we got married. Now I have made a mistake in our marriage I am not perfect. Neither is he. He was so mean all the time. I felt so terrible and when someone else makes you feel nice you run towards even if its wrong. But it has been 17 years since then. I take care of his medications. And I help where I can with appts. I take care of the kids. I work full time crap hours. I barely function. When I ask for help I am seen as weak. I am trying to not show I am sad at all. I try to be everything to everyone. My oldest has attitude and wants to move out or whatever. I have a great job at the hospital. Its the hours that kill me and give me tremendous mom guilt because I am so tired and try to get some sleep but not everything gets done. I think my co workers like me. I am such a people pleaser. Its nuts. I am not trying to look for compliments. But damn I do so much for everyone and no one gives a crap. My husband says I am lucky to even be where I am. I would have nothing if it was not for him. The only that would truly miss me is my 9 year old. Because she is the heart of us. The 18 year old would be put in a home if I died. The 20 year old would be pissed but get over it. The 17 year and my parents would be like what took so long? How did she ever live past Robyn? My birth mom. I am adopted by my aunt and uncle. My husbands sister who I was so there for her when she went through cancer out of no where quit taking to me two years ago. I have not spoken to my parents since my daughter went to live with them. Everyone seems to forget that I am the one they went to for everything. Childcare money advice. So I make one mistake and I am a piece of shit forever? No one helped me when my husband was hitting me. I actually met with my dad at a restaurant. He would not even let me and my kids come home. He said stick it out. So here I am 22 years later. I love my husband. I do sweet things to try and get affection. All I get is what I think he has a girlfriend. I honestly do not care. I just wish I was treated like a person. I work my butt off. My husband spends so much time and effort looking for records he wants to buy. On his phone!!!!! I hate smart phones so much. He is on his so much. I have mentioned before that the whole house is not on a device and no one listens. I really hate how not a single person in my life can actually be nice to me except my disabled daughter most days. And my 9 year old. Those two are the only reason I am still here. because I would rather not. There is so much more. Now I know worse things happened to other people and i should not be whining about anything. Thanks for taking the time to read. I do wish you a great day of sunshine So over it,Depression
25843,How do you stay focused on the positives? I have a bad history of overthinking things to the point I ruin them for myself. I am starting a new relationship and I am trying to manage PTSD depression and anxiety from other issues. But I cannot help but focus on the idea that what if this is all just some ploy to get me hooked on then dump me. Like I know its ridiculous. I can tell the girl really does like me for me despite the crap I deal with in my own head. But I cannot stay focused on that very well. I always feel like resorting to self sabotage when things go well to save myself from future heartache. I want this to work out on its own natural path without my stupid brain from interfering but I have no idea how. I could use some advice here. I am kind of lost. Trying to stay focused,Depression
22538,So for context when me and my ex started dating I pretty much pushed everyone away because all I wanted to do was focus on him and I. I still had friends but I never really talked to them or hung out with them. Nine months later we broke up and I do not have that many friends anymore. I have been really wanting to make more friends but my only problem is just that I do not have enough motivation to try to find friends. It sucks because I also do not talk to the friends I have because I am scared of them leaving me as well I know that is stupid because we have been friends for so long but yeah. I really do not want to be depressed all summer and have barely anyone to talk to but its looking like that is what is going to happen so yay. Idk what to title this,Depression
10479,So I really screwed up a chunk of my life. From 1923 I isolated in my room. Its the cold truth and I am real ashamed about it. I cut off all my friends and only talked to the most toxic group in my life a bunch of older guys I played COD with who Id been trying to impress but always got made fun of and singled out. I only stayed because it was interaction with the safety of being online.Well I went out and challenged my anxiety got a job at a grocery store and things are getting better again. The only problem is after all those years of self loathing I get a lot of are you okay? Or Lighten up. Or Something bothering you? when everything really is fine and I am just going about my day. So has anyone found a way to get passed this? How to get rid of resting depressed face?,Depression
13668,I also take a sleeping pill for my insomnia. But Do any of you guys get nightmares while on your antidepressants? Mine have increased lately. I am not as anxious or down as I normally am so I do not understand. Is this a side effect? Wondering if there is a way to stop it dumb question I know I just hate it because I wake up feeling quite drained and disturbed. Nightmares on antidepressants?,Depression
7039,A week ago my overseas boyfriend of 6 years went to prison. This means no contact for 18 months for us. Idk how I have coped honestly. there is been days where I do not feel like living and are never ending. I am young I am 17 and hes 19 but this is the man I want to spend the rest of my life with. We are not able to call due to me not being 18 yet and I cannot go over seas due to covid an financial situations atm. I knew it would be hard but I never thought it would be this hard. I have started sleeping all day not eating falling behind on class work and constantly cryingpanic attacks. I miss him so fucking much every single day and dread the 17 months ahead of us. there is a possibility he could get out in 12 but I do not want to get my hopes up. I am so grateful it did not hit the 2 year mark or was not a sentence like 5 years but its still so hard. It constantly feels like I do not want to live anymore but I am trying hard to hold on for him. have not felt this pain in a while. Heart ache more like heart attack.,Depression

40974,nach jahren die ich mit einem narzissten einem mann dem alles egal war und jemandem mit depression verbracht habe wird mir immer klarer da ich absolut keine vorstellung davon habe wie eine sichere vertrauens und liebevolle beziehung eigentlich aussehen sollte,Depression
25318,Background info Ever since I was young I was obsessed with this sport and would spend all day playing thinking about watching it etc. No matter what had happened it was my main purpose and my main source of happiness it wasis more or less my identity I have played and obsessed over improving since I was 8 years old Now 19 so 11 years of blood sweat and tears put in to get better and progress this is the main theme of this post.Back in 2018 I was diagnosed with depression and had counselling It did not work a big part of this was the feeling of unfulfilled potential in a certain sport this was from myself I was really happy with how I was progressing at 1415 yrs old and would spend hours of my day thinking and working to improve even marginally I was obsessed because of this I saw a huge jump in my ability and I went from good to very good for my age I then got complacent forgetting that I was not an especially gifted athlete in the traditional sense so I made up for it through drilling technique and working hard so while I made loads of progress I forgot that it was because of my hunger and not natural athleticism due to complacency I got lazy over the winter off season and started getting unfit due to eating crap foods not training anywhere near enough as I had before due to this I came back worse despite getting bigger and stronger due to puberty I regressed and suddenly felt a sense of worthlessness as I was not where I expected to be after a great previous season. I then fell into depression stopped caring about anything and even started to care about the sport less and less putting on loads of weight.I eventually got fit again and came back better than ever both mentally and physically I had then progressed even more and noticed a huge jump from the season before and I kept this hunger to improve through the off season winter just gone I worked even harder and kept myself in great shape hoping to progress even more I had the obsession back. Then I come back and get injured and I am not sure I will ever be able to play again and if I do I will not be anywhere near as good. Just as my life gained purpose again I get this and now I feel isolated and alone as I notice no signs of improvement. I feel terrible and now I know I am slipping back into depression with no outlet and focus I have nothing to look forward to and strive towards in my life and the worst part is that I had spent my whole life working hard and enjoying this putting in hours of work to get better and play at a higher standard and now that whole 11 years will be for nothing as I am not even going to be able to play past my teen years my whole identity has been stripped away and I am not sure what the hell I can do...TLDR I have just wasted 11 years of my life and now I have no passion or identity.P.S. Sorry for the long post I needed to ramble and appreciate it is not the most coherent writing. My whole life is quickly unravelling again this time I am worried I cannot come back,Depression
11605,Honestly I feel like shit. I feel like my life is driven by sadness hate and blind anger. Otherwise I do not feel anything. Otherwise I feel absolutely nothing. I do not care about anything and I do not want to do anything. I found that things I used to love bring me very little to none satisfaction at all. I cannot make decisions on my own. I spend all night long crying until it is morning. And the absolute worst is that I cannot talk about it with anyone. All my friends are normal and do not like all this depression shit. Last time I talked with them about it they said that I do not have depression and I am just a poser. I do not want to talk about it with my parents neither. And my therapist does not really help. I feel like no one understands me. My mom said it is just a stage a few months ago. But is it really just a stage? Is it really just a stage?,Depression
15193,I am from Rome Italy. I moved to Finland and lived there for 3 years. I have an anxiety disorder and OCD and the daily life in Finland slowly pushed me into depression. I started drinking a lot and after 2 years I still drink at least 34 beers a day to numb the pain. I had to move to my parent's house since I still do not have a job and they are highly toxic. Recently they told us they are having a divorce because my dad came out as gay and has been cheating on my mom for decades with other men. Recently my best friend I have known her for more than 20 years had a mental breakdown and attempted suicide. She is now in the psych ward and I do not recognize her. I do not have a job because covid happened and my parents are always away I have been alone at home for months now drinking everyday taking drunk naps and waking up feeling even more depressed day by day. I did not ask for all this but here I am in the middle of everything and I do not know how to cope with this pain anymore. If anyone could share any life experience related to mine and offer some support it would be gladly appreciated. I ran away from my life in Finland because of depression only to get my life torn apart even more in my home country,Depression
38702,so i got depression anxiety and the debilitating i can t do ish type i am currently procrastinating on an assignment i need to do fast help also do you guy feel like you have an almost physical pain due to all this stuff that you try to avoid facing,Depression
18799,I am realy struggling to do anything at the moment. I am super low all the time and have very little motivation for anything. I am too depressed and anxiois to get a job to socialise even talking to family is so nerve racking for me atm and i just cannot fight the feeling off. I just feel like everything I have done up to this point has been a misstep and it will not get better at all. I have completed university now but have no confidence or ambition. I also have no money. Literally NOTHING. I spent my aavings on my final project and had little help from others so i was wiped out essentially. I am so scared to tell my family just how bad it is as I have already asked them for money fairly recently and used it up. I just do not feel able to do anything and wish i was in a better place. I feel like a complete and utter failure,Depression
27013,By all reasonable metrics my life is absolutely fantastic. I work as a software developer which I love or well loved have worked at a very large well known software company and now work at essentially my dream job at a quickly growing and very successful startup. I am married have 100k in cash savings and more in investments. I am only 3 years out of college but I have 10 years of actual development experience and supposedly am one of the best performers in the places I have worked.However I absolutely detest my life. I have no joy in anything. Video games that would be enjoyable now are just the easiest way to distract myself from feeling terrible but I do not actually feel like I have enjoyed the time spent. For the most part I never did anything outside of work either I would browse Reddit try to play a game or just sit around. I would occasionally go on bike rides or walks but I have never been a very outdoorsy person I am allergic to everything and have exercise induced asthma. Exercise never seemed to help me feel better or sleep anyway. Life became a very dull cycle of wakeup work constantly wait for work to be over sit around constantly wait and dread work starting etc...I am constantly extremely tired and I wake up quite often in the night. My various doctors have taken me through 5 depression and 6 sleep medications in the past year or so and none have brought much relief. I have had two sleep studies that not only turned up nothing but left the doctors telling me that it looked like I slept fine. I have trouble even taking naps so while I am constantly fighting to keep my eyes open I will not actually fall asleep in most cases which becomes very wearing and boring.I am or was typically a very passionate motivated person. I was always reading stuff to learn was very dedicated in school was always thinking of side projects to work on etc... I started a medical leave from work a month ago because I could not handle starting work each day. Since then I have felt no motivation to do anything and an extreme dread at the idea of returning to work. I liked writing software my team was great but I was always sitting there waiting for my 8 hours to be up so I could go home and be sad when I do not accomplish anything.ampx200BIt seems like such a poor career choice to just outright quit a job with no plan but I honestly do not know what else I can do. I suppose I can force myself to go back to work and just keep going through the days but I honestly think I cannot take that. If I ever get better I should be able to find another job without much trouble but this was my dream job and I am considering giving it up just because I am weak. I am also considering burning savings which although it should last for quite a while seems foolhardy.Is there anything you would suggest that may be a better course of action? Help me justify or condemn these ideas as I do not have anyone besides my wife who really understands my predicament. Extremely burnt out at 25. Considering quitting job and taking an extended break,Depression
48083,I'm desperate for a friend and to feel loved by someone. I really need a friend. I don't even have a single best friend and I'm desperate to find true love. Please help me. No one responded to my last post. It seems like no one cares about me and my life doesn't matter. Female here just saying,Depression
48303,solutions So when I have my real bad downs there isn't any way to just pull me out of there. I usually just sit through it. It's not nice but I can't do anything about it. Why is it that other people keep suggesting find a way out of it? It's not like I haven't tried. I get to hear that everytime I open up a bit about that topic. Then I regret doing so It feels like I'm failing at everything when they mention stuff like that. Like I'm too stupid to find a way out. How do you deal with such stuff? Do you deal with it in the first place?,Depression
25987,My anxiety and depression have set me back enormously in life since it started and I have been bleeding away since academically socially and romantically I have tried therapy but it just does not work for me i believe it is going to be genetic as there is history in both sides of my family and the worst part is that my peers are slowly pulling away and it is so frustrating because it is an illness that is stopping me an illness we have no strong cure for and slowly chips away at me.Just wanted to vent Setting me back,Depression
26085,Everyone moves on Beginning their life and working on their future while I am back here watching like I missed the train and now I am stuck at the station as the train speeds off into the horizon wondering if I should start running to catch up or give up and fall onto the rails and let the next train mangle my body.

I do the bare minimum to keep it do not even want it. No one knows I exist except my parents. I think about just writing them a suicide noteemail. Send it at like 1am when they will def be asleep and then they may not even see it for a day. Throw my cell in a river. And just walk away from everything. Maybe Ill eventually kill myself maybe something better will come of it. All I ever think about is running away. Wish my ex was still here to come with me. No one ever cared about me like her. And no one has ever told me they hate me like her. I think about ending it so often,Depression

In the last 6 months I have lost my apartment lost my GF of 5 years lost my job lost my dog had to move back home mom just got diagnosed with cancer having a super hard time finding work again that will work with me having to take my mom to daily doctors appointments. The scary thing is I have just kind of become numb to it all. I do not cry and have panic attacks or feel anything anymore. Its just been a constant feeling of unreality like everything is a movie and I am just watching it happen. I do not really have anyone to talk to about it my mom was usually that person that would put things into perspective but I am not trying to burden her with my struggles when she is dealing with her own I am just trying to put on a brave face for her. But I feel like I am running on fumes at this point. Its been a rough 6 months.,Depression

10425,I am a little ffd up rn so if I do not make sense I am sorry. anyway I used to have a job at a restaurant back in 2019 and was a solo host busser. the environment was pretty high stress because of all the duties I had to cover at once including online orders. I had another job as a janitor not to long ago it had it is perks sometimes but we were short staffed so work was heavy. even so I feel like I could have done the work in my sleep. it was so simple and repeated that I started to dissociate really fast almost every day. it made it really easy to think about some really dark stuff directed at myself. the restaurant job was too high stress for me. every time I had to handle money as well was really bad because I would be shaking so much that the change would fall. I just do not know what kind of job is going to be relaxed but not to where I am by myself but also not going to be stressful. I am feeling really held back by this stuff and it is the worst feeling ever. help or advice is really appreciated guys!! I do not know how to get a job if my anxiety and depression make it so hard mentally for me,Depression
12586,Hi everybody. I was diagnosed with burnoutdepression 8 months ago. The 4 first months I only took StJon's wort. Then 3 months of Lexapro up to 20mg which helped me but I was too spaced out so my psy switched me to Effexor for 3 weeks which were terrible. Then I asked for Brintellix because of the side effects profile. 1 month in and I feel not better at all.My Psy wants me to try Prozac now. Do you guys have success stories with Prozac after failure with many others ? I am starting to feel hopeless.. 4th drug.. I am loosing hope,Depression
47110,my depression keeps getting worse and i want to stop pushing away the people i love. 20MI feel like im slowly decaying. My mind slips i cant remember much anymore i have no desire to do any fun activities anymore at least not the ones that ive done already which is just about everything. I have all the desire in the world to get better but no motivation. I can honestly feel myself getting worse each month. I noticed that i become a little more sad and unmotivated over time and i really cant seem to stop it from progressing. It feels like a disease.My life just feels like im in limbo every day. I wake up do the same thing all day that ive done a million times this week then wait until my insomnia decides to let me sleep. At night i get into depressive episodes that lead to panic attacks which fill my head with intrusive thoughts that i would never think normally. Its nothing horrifying or disturbing but they really bother me. Its like the voice in my head wants me to be sad on purpose.The thought that really bugs me the most the reason for making this post in the first place tells me to push people away. Not really in that exact manner but i question if i can really feel anything towards the people who are close to me. Everyone is normally completely fine but not during my episode. It makes me feel like a completely different person. It makes me wonder if i really love my girlfriend and if id be better off alone. Its similar for my friends. Im fine with them normally but during my episodes they annoy me and i feel like i want to stop talking to them. But after i go to sleep and wake up everything is back to normal. I love my girlfriend and i like my friends. This thought didnt start happening until this month. I never used to want to push people away because ive always been the lonely type who wants more friends and i always hated being alone and i still do which is how i can tell that im getting worse. Im just not me anymore im a completely different person than the one i used to know.The other thoughts are just pessimistic jabs at my future and general sadness questions. Wondering if im ever going to live a stable life or if im going to feel happy and content ever again or if i will continue to be a failure forever. I always have to remind myself that it has to get better eventually and i cant feel like this forever but most times its hard to convince myself. I cant remember the last time i didnt feel terrible. Im not suicidal i dont have a desire to stop living and dont even get thoughts about it whatsoever. But these episodes make it really difficult to be a living functioning person.I need to know how to stop thinking this way when i start to feel hopeless. I know i probably need a therapist or psychiatrist to help me professionally but im afraid of them.,Depression
21478,Been depressed for too long. Like 1011 years. All meds make it worse and I am on awful med withdrawal rn. I will never have any relationship in my life because depression kills my brain and any interesting part of me. Ill probably die a virgin too. I am so bored of EVERYTHING I seriously want to be gone. Why cannot euthanasia be legal. Its not fair for me to live like this. Life is constant suffering. I am too scared of death to do it and I have failed suicide but damn I want to be gone Really just want to die,Depression
48116,I started to hate myself I am 31 I soon to be 32. I studied two bachelors's degree consequently to escape working. Now i realize that i destroyed my future. I have never planned my future. I am currently mooching off from my elder brother and my mother. I am also now in deep depression. I am so insecure and have zero confidence that it takes massive amount time to open a thread and make a comment. I realize that I have missed so many thing in my life and hate myself for it.,Depression
47971,Whats gonna happen? I 19f are slowly coming to terms with the fact that I might be suffering with depression.Im getting to this conclusion through having noticed the change in myself and through gentle research and sharing thoughts with a very dear and extraordinarily patient friend.Im reluctant to seek professional help but I dont think Im sustainable like this.I just wanted to ask if there was anyone from the UK who could sort of tell me what would happen if I were to go to the GP and seek help.Thank you,Depression
19516,Is anyone else just like full blown depressed and 100 ready to die at any moment but you just end up living life and being a complicit player in this weird SICK game lol I feel so confused and always think about taking my life but honestly its hard and takes so much work and effort and you just want to lay down and fall into a light blissful rest in which you hope you never wake from lolz lmk if you guys feel the same xoxox I am fully ready to pass away,Depression
26573,I have never been loved in my life i wish someone did i feel so lonely and worthless that i always end up crying myself to sleep. I wonder how it feels to be loved.,Depression
15948,TLDR last paragraphAt the moment I am going through some extremely difficult times. My physical health has declined very drastically after going through a rather rough time of not being able to find the right medicine. Its been two years since I started really feeling the difference from me being really sad and me being depressed. I did not get onto the right combinations of medicines until the end of April this year. I forgot what it was like to have good days so when the medicine started working it was so amazing. I was so happy. I was improving and fixing so much of what I had lost and I felt better than ever. This did not last and that is why I titled this the way it is. My partner and I have been together for a long time. Many years before I was diagnosed with depression. I was the one who looked after her mental health so when we switched it made some things really difficult. She saved me from myself so many times and I always let everyone know how grateful I was to her. Eventually the medicine worked and I was feeling happy for myself and our relationship. However it took a great toll on her and she kept her feelings from me and made hasty decisions she regrets making. She wanted us to take a break while she could be more independent. I did not get this because I said I would totally support her with everything. Hours later she regretted saying what she said. It was hard for me this has never happened between us before. We eventually started getting back on track even though things were tense. Her pet ended up dying and she went to visit family for the weekend when she came back she said she wanted us to take a break again. I kind of broke at that point she kept trying to convince me that she still wanted us to be together but I just could not understand. So I said okay but I told her that I do not think I could just take a break. She sat on this for a couple hours and regretted it again. It was much much harder for me to come back this time. And now I am the one struggling with how I feel about her. I love her deeply but these wounds are so large and I do not know if Ill be able to have them fixed. We are trying but its going to take a long time. This also worries me and hurts my trust in her. I have also lost a connection to a group of close friends during this time. We go to different universities and I have not know them as long as they had known each other. The other friend that is long distance like me is the one I am closest to. When my medicine started working I told him that I was worried about this very thing happening and then it did. I feel alone and apart from everyone in my life and its horrible. I dislike pity. Mostly just from those close to me and care for me deeply but just do not get what I am going through. My grandmother is the closest person to me in my whole life and I rely heavily on her input. Telling her how bad my physical health has become killed me. Hearing her cry because she is so scared for me is too much and it makes me feel so horrible. Back to the title there is a difference in this depression on this medicine and what I was on before. I am lucid and capable of rational thought and it can feel so much worse than when I could not process everything. I am looking for the answers to help me now and never finding them makes everything so much worse. The different emotions I feel get thought about and it makes me so mad that I cannot do anything about it. I am at the point where I may stop taking my medicine to make things easier for me I just do not want to regret this later. I am worried and hurt. Sometimes I feel worse when I am on my medicine,Depression
8282,I have not been diagnosed but I know I am suffering things that used to be easy eat at me from inside. I push all my friends away from me I have been meaning to change my bed sheets for over a month I feel filthy I do not want to take care of myself the only reason I shower occasionally is to look presentable for once in front of my parents. Every day I am ashamed of myself and crushed by guilt from what I am unable to do because it should be so easy. I am so ashamed of myself.I have tried talking to my parents but nothing's come of it. I have talked to my mom several times and asked her to maybe look at therapy options for me but nothing's happened I feel like she thinks I said these things to her only for attention but I did not . She told me I need to stop looking for other things to blame my hardships on. I have had conversation with my dad and he acknowledged me in the moment but did not bring it up again afterwards. I am tired of not being taken seriously. I am too embarrassed to ask for help again especially since I have been trying to hide it from my parents so I guess they think I am fine now. I feel embarrassed that I need help. How do I do it myself??If it matters I am 17. How to get better without help from others?,Depression
47636,I had a vivid dream today. I was on a high rise I saw an opportunity and took it. As I was plummeting down I had no regret. I knew that as soon as I hit the ground my suffering will be over. I don't know what to make of it.,Depression
15781,My friend texted me today saying they are tired of my fantasies of people hating me they think I am just saying it because I can get away with it. Idk what to think about it I genuinely think this way and I do not know what to do anymore. Friend thinks I am faking,Depression

38606,so about day ago i started sh again and i cut to deep i waited a week till i went to the hospital by then it wa to late to get stitch but the doctor said i should have got them my best friend knew i went to the doctor and she told me i didn t need stitch she accused me of lying and doesn t believe me she act like she s a doctor and always act like she s right,Depression
13856,As a broke 31M I literally can not think of a single other thing than money. I have stupidly gotten myself into debt not too bad but I cannot get ahead of it. I firmly believe money can buy happiness but at this rate it does not seem like Ill ever find out firsthand. My whole existence is based around paying bills,Depression
13999,Day in and day out I just sit at home while my parents work. I have 1 friend who I hardly ever see I never change out of my PJs I never get ready I never do anything productive or worthwhile all I do is sit in my house on my computer and eat my meals until its time to shower and go to bed I wake up at noon the next day and do it again it is not even particularly miserable it just sounds that way. It feels just practical to me why would I get ready every day just to do the same thing I do now but uncomfortably. it is just more work for nothing I know I am lazy but what does it even matter I have no responsibilities right now so why should I create any Is it normal to do literally nothing all the time,Depression
22078,I am just so fucking sad. Every day feels like an eternity of pain. I know i should get help but it just seems so difficult and pointless. I have felt like this on and off for a long time but have not self harmed or attempted suicide since I was a teenager. I am in love with my sons father who i live with who gaslights me and tells me he will never love me but will not allow me to talk to any one. I had a great job but quit bc i felt like I was going to drive my car into the river on the way to work one day. I am so lost and alone and I just want a genuine human connection but my history of trauma makes it impossible. I am at the end of my rope and I do not know what to do. I do not want to kill myself bc i have children who love me but feeling so isolated alone and misunderstood is eating away at my insides and I am so sad recently I just believe everyone would be better off if I was not here. Black hole within,Depression

26346,Note please forgive me for my bad english if you find any grammatical error in my text..English is not my first languageSo when I said I feel like a clown it means that I always try to be funny with others especially with my mom but these moments of joy are passed then I feel depressed sad alone sexually and emotionaly frustated and always anxious for my futureHere is my backstory I lost my father at age of 13 from then my mother raise me and my sister and also take care of my grandmother. She is a school teacher..so after her workhours she take care of us. But things get terrible when my uncles and other relatives distances themself from us they do not want to take any responsibity of the childrens of their dead brother. So they tries to question the character of my mother..they said terrible things to her and others to defame her..I heared lots of bullshit about my mother from their shitty mouth but my mom told me not to respond and kids should not involve in these things..I never saw my mom to taking a stand against them and we both are strictly told to not to respond in any way and then we get enters on college..My sister and me both are living a college life in different cities and my mom live alone in our home at that time..Since my mom also lost her father at very young age and now she is goning through these things I promised myself to not her let down in any way..But this is not a case for my sister..My sister starts to live in a livein relationship with guy outside our knowledge. Here I want to tell you that I am living in a society where livein relationships are not acceptable at all but still my mom and I tried to understand my sisters view and we want her to know good and bad sides of these kind of relationships..But then we saw her boyfriend and after getting some information about him we found that that guy is a liar and has many relationships he has many worst kind of people in his friend circle and is very manupulative in nature..When we tried to warn my sister that asshole tried to threaten us by fileing falls police case against us..we are trying handle this situation but one morning my sister ran away from our house..We tried to search her but then we get a call from her and she said that she married to that guy and she never want to return our home...I still remember my mothers eyes..she was crying and feel helpless this action of my sister broked from inside I never imagined this can be happen..but its just the beginning of misery for us. Three days after that incident I was sexually molested by one of my distant uncle who visited us..I never told this to my mother I was 19 year old boy at that time..Another relative of mine taking advantage of our situation did a financial fraud with us and my mom lost her most the savings at that time..All these things happened to us one by one hard to explain this to someone but it happen..I just one year everything in our life is changed forever..Due to stress and anxiety my mother's health get badly affected..she was living alone and I have to complete remaining one year of my college but I left my college to take care of my mother and I did all work in household and try to make her laugh so she can feel better..I take 2 more year to complete my degree..my academics was badly affected due to these circumstances and because of this I was ineligible for my dream job even for masters my graduation record is not good at all..and have no money to continue further studies.So I decided to stay in home with my mom taking care of her and do self study. But its not easy for me..Whenever I try to focus on studies all the bad things happened to me are come in front of my eyes..I am 27 now have no selfconfidence because I achieved nothing yet..I feel ashamed in front of others all the time..I never been into relationship because I have no confidence to talk with girls and I also do not trust them..I feel like everyone around me would cheat or betray me in future so I distances myself from my friends and relatives..I do not want get molested anymoreIt feels like I never found a girl who can talk to me because I have nothing to give anything to her..What can an unhappy looser like me can give anything to anyone so I try to be funny anyone around me they laugh but deep down I know that I can never move forward with that person.By looking my past I think whatever I do its going to be fail in future and gives terrible outcomes..I do not know what to do how can I get myself out from this ? I feel like Clown,Depression

18709,I have had depression since 7th grade. I am 26 female and have all the things I thought I always wanted in life. A house a loving boyfriend two dogs good joband I am not happy. Everyday is the same in depression world. Its been this way for years. I had one year of true happiness in my teens and it ended after the person I believe was my soulmate moved. I have tried talking to them and although they feel the same in terms of it being the happiest year of both of our lives they are content living their own life with their own partner and I am justexistinglike I always have been. The very few friends I have are great but they are busy with their own lives and honestly they do not want to hangout despite me trying to set up times to. Does anyone else live the same depressing day? I have gone out and taken walks with my dogsvisited family members worked out gone shopping tried to take up hobbies but it does not work? Life feels like its spinning faster and faster each day passing by with absolute meaninglessness Groundhog day,Depression

13959,I am horrible with words and conveying thoughts so a she will is the best way I can describe this feeling. I remember May of 2018 when I graduated from college. That was a wonderful experience and a serious milestone in my life. I was so proud of my accomplishment and was absolutely elated the entire week through the graduation ceremony. I felt excited to begin the new chapter of my life starting a new job making my own money having my own true apartment. At that time I felt pretty happy.In January of this year I had been offered a new job after searching for 18 months. I had received a 40 salary increase had the opportunity to move to Atlanta and move back in with my twin brother. One would argue that this was a serious milestone I achieved after graduating from college. should not I be elated about this opportunity? I have been in the new job for 5 months the new city for 3 months. As I am typing this post out I am doing some serious soul searching and asking myself How do I truly feel about this incredible milestone? that is just it I do not feel anything. All I truly feel towards this is it is a milestone and it happened. Its like there is this she will around me that refuses any emotion from entering. I would hate to use the word dull but that is really what it feels like. The outward emotion that this entire milestone feels just dull. And yet in reality dull is not at all how I should be describing this insane achievement. Honestly its hard to explain.Side note I have not been diagnosed with depression but today at work my boss noticed I was making more mistakes than usual so he asked me Is everything going OK in your world? Atlanta still treating you OK? Just wanted to check in on you because its not like you to make mistakes. Let me know if you need anything. Him questioning this made me think about the status of my mental state over the past few days and a she will is how I would describe it. And honestly I have felt this way for the past year almost even at my old job. I have no one to talk to deeply about these feelings so I wanted to share here. Does depression embody a she will around yourself?,Depression

15264,Hi all. I 22M have been in a relationship with my boyfriend 22 for about 5 months. We love each other he is quite time constrained due to his work and so we are only meeting on weekends. I have been diagnosed with depression been going to therapy for a month and also taking ladose for two weeks. I have not become any better I spend most of my days crying and all this hurts my relationship. I question his feelings for me a lot and I am quite insecure. He is there for me but my heart breaks because I feel like a burden and I just do not know what to do. we have discussed it a number of times the last one I ended up crying at his chest for like an hour. I hate me. I feel that I am pushing my loved one away even if he says he is there for me. I am kind of lost My depression and insecurities hurt my relationship,Depression

15553,I do not want to offend anyone so please know I am just asking for advicewisdomexperience not trying to be hurtful. Do you know when you are not yourself? My husband thinks everything is fine but he is so grumpy with all of us 3 kids short tempered and not fun to be around usually is amazing to be around. I say that I am codependent because I Always want to be around him but I prefer doing things without him now because of how he treats me and how little things make him explode. This is how he is when his depression is not managed but he does not seem to know there is a difference. He thinks he is just himself but I know and the whole family has to walk on eggshells around him. I have suggested getting back to the gym that meds does the trick and for 2 or 3 years I got HIM...when he was doing that.. He will not go to the gym or lift on our weight bench at home and insists that he does not need to and he is fine. I cannot do this again dealt with him in depression for 10 years. Ten hard years where he could not love me bc he did not love himself. I stuck with him but finally put my foot down that he needed help which is why he finally started meds and am starting to feel depressed myself sad crying do not want to get out of bed just thinking that this is happening again. it is been going on a few months. Very bad for 2 weeks. we have been married for 18 years. I have talked to him and he just gets mad and says he does not need to work out and that I am the problem and he is normal. Thank you for any help. From a wife,Depression

21334,it is July of 2021 the days go by. They keep going nothing changes. The occasional tests are cheated on and flunked. Oral assessments are a disaster not helped much by lastday preparations. Term 1 boards exams come near whatever can be pieced together is cooked in a hurry. Under severe shock new plans for minimizing further damage are made up. The clock keeps ticking. One day at a time most of the work is procrastinated upon. Expectations are subsequently lowered with every passing day. More plans to control the situation emerge but none stands to win against the unbeatable duo of broken mental health and a fuckedup life.The entrance exam doomsday comes near. A last attempt to avert total destruction comes into action to save whatever little that can be saved. Under immense pressure the kind of routine that should have always been finally comes to existance. The desperate broken kid weaker than ever tries the best to stand his ground.The clock ticks exponentially louder before becoming irrelevant. The worst that could be foreseen had happened. All psychological stability now hangs on thin thread. Even that thread is stretched further by unforgiving waves of questions criticism and jokes.What comes after is a 4yearlong night where all hopes are eventually buried all signs of optimism are lost. Life grows more weary than ever and I am reminded of the cost everyday.That is until one day it all comes crashing down or so do I suppose. I let go of the past reinvent myself and move on or so do my wishful daydreams look like. The darkness and silence grows itself stronger in my mind as I walk down the path of life all alone unwanted for who I am unloved for the tears I have always she would. Last,Depression
47168,I'm tired all the time This might sound like an exaggeration but I'm being dead serious when I say I have not felt properly awake in months and it's awful. I don't know why I feel this way but its majorly impacting my life. I usually sleep for 15 hours a day and those other 9 hours are just me forcing myself to stay awake until I physically can't anymore. I've tried everything I started working out and have lost 20 pounds since the year started and I still don't feel energized. I had to switch to online school due to several factors but one of them was my inability to make it through the school day because I was just so tired that I couldn't function. I drink dangerous amounts of caffeine on the daily but even that doesn't help. I don't know what to do but feeling this way just makes me extremely suicidal. Being awake is painful.,Depression
13286,Recently my life has just been on a downward spiral. I do not enjoy spending time with my friends anymore. The only person I see is my boyfriend and I have began to feel like I am a burden to him. My family only reinforces that I have nothing going for me. Its so depressing to finally feel like your making baby steps just for a family member to take it all away from you with just a few harsh words. I feel stuck. I feel like I have nothing going for me,Depression
11844,nothing even went through my mind at that point I was just like huh this object looks sharp. eternal sleep is sounding pretty good to me right now and I cut straight to white. I am lucky the cut was not deep and i did not cut close enough to a veinhow can I even try to keep myself alive? sure life is full fucking pain and agony right now but jesus christ. I have nobody to talk to who is actually there for me in my life especially not my family I went down to my kitchen for some food next thing I know I fucking attempted suicide,Depression

47271,People with depression are strong as fuck. Seriously every single one of us are fucking warriors. From the monumental effort it takes to drag ourselves into consciousness when we just want to sleep forever to showing up at work amp pretending you havent spent the morning crying or thinking of hurting yourself or wanting to just check out permanently or all of the above.I know its horrible that we do have to deal with it but taking a second to recognize how monumentally tough we are is important I think as we always get stuck on the things we hate about ourselves.It is one positive thing that every person reading this who is battling depression the absolute Herculean strength we have is absolutely incredible.If youre reading this you are incredible the strength you show every single day is something that most people cant even fathom.I had a bad day today amp wanted to try amp shed some positivity on it amp share that with anyone else struggling right now. You are brilliant.,Depression
18447,This is a throwaway as my friends and some colleagues know my main reddit. Also sorry if this is not the right subreddit.ampx200BTo start I had a pretty good upbringing and almost no problems at all. I went through school without much trouble. My parents were good to me. Really nothing to complain about. But I just do not feel joy in anything at all hobby's I had just feel so mundane like everything else. I quickly get annoyed or just drained when I am able to hangout with friends. When I am alone for too long my thoughts just get so deep and sometimes get suicidal. This has been going on for sometime.Despite Covid19 rampaging around I could find a somewhat decent paying job. I drowned myself in work just so I could not think at all. My colleague and now somewhat close friend was worried about me working too much but to be honest I do not mind it. That was until she made it clear I was really just living to work the past year. I recently made a promotion to a supervising position but frankly it does not do much to me. it is not that I miss my old work that much but it just does not trigger anything inside of me. If anything I am sort of left with a bittersweet feeling. This is just me in a nutshell. A 22 year old who had a normal upbringing who for some reason has no joy in life or a goal at all. Why,Depression

24728,I have been single for almost 6 months now. I lost everything. I lost the person I thought was the love of my life. She hurt me and left me in the dust. I have absolutely no idea how to cope with being alone. I have done everything to improve myself and to help myself move on but it is impossible. I already had severe depression before the break up but now it is so bad to the point I have isolated myself from the world. I am so lonely it has made me sick. I long for someone is arms around me and long to just hold someone at night. I long for love and affection but cannot have it. Everyone I ever love leaves and hurts me. I have had nothing but time to move on and I have not. Moving on is not possible for me. I loved my ex too much. I am pretty sure she is already with someone else as well. I cannot forget her even though I try so hard. She broke me to pieces. Everyday I wish that I do not wake up. I am not happy I am depressed and hurt and just want to rest. I want a break. A permanent one. One where I do not think or feel anymore. I just want silence. I want peace. I wish I was never born. This is not a happy life. it is emotional torture to be alive. I hate being alone.,Depression

22889,Ever since summer started I have been trying to get back into dating and it is been pretty unsuccessful. Only 1 real date that has not led to much more. In the midst of this obviously I have been feeling terrible. No one seems to give me the time of day and I have been feeling even more worthless than usual. This all led to a bit of a breakdown recently where I just cried for an hour on the floor feeling like I wanted to kill myself because no one seems to ever care about me like I want them to. Cut to yesterday and my friend calls me and basically brags about all the casual sex he is having now that he is moved to a new city. On top of that he is hitting it off with a women he is super attracted to. It like the world wants me to kill myself. What am I supposed to do with this? it is like life is laughing in my face by rubbing all the shit I want in front of me knowing I cannot get it. Life feels like it is mocking me,Depression
11645,You will see me achieve and talk and tick items off my todo list. You will see me laugh and apply concealer and wear outfits that appease the public. You will note me walking at a slower pace to my office in the bitterly cold mornings. You will see me sigh.You will see me buy coffee many times. You will see me touch my outer thigh you will see my hand linger and grip the flesh there in a way not dissimilar to a butcher testing the quality of a cut of meat. I will walk to my car get in rip off my mask to display an expression that conveyed more emotion with a piece of cotton covering my mouth. I am getting closer and closer every day. I am still too far. But I am getting closer.Soon you will see me gone. Soon you will see me dead. You will see me. You will see me.,Depression

15567,Why do I always get in fights with all my friends? Its never me who initiates it either. Everyone always has a problem with me idk. Its like everybody that gets close to me just hates my personality. I cannot wait to find the right person that I do not have to mask for. No friends anymore after I fought with every single one of them and we just moved on. It makes me feel down on myself because I do not know what I am doing wrong. Its literally just my personality that is wrong ig Fights with friends,Depression
23234,Its been a week since I was diagnosed with MDD major depressive disorder and anxiety. I have always struggled with depressive episodes but this time I was done. I however did not commit suicide. I did not want to feel the presence of death taking over while having not sought for help. Id have hated myself for it even though deep down death is a desire. I have no will to live as my life is meaningless but I would not have ever forgiven myself for acting on my suicidal thoughts without putting up a fight first. My therapist thinks its a good idea to let my parents know about my condition. I am not comfortable with this but I am a minor its necessary. My parents are meeting with my therapist today and I am scared. This might be my final straw. I had nothing to live for anyway I do not think I can do this,Depression
48070,Am I the only one? I'm sure that many of you are looking for springtime to go out and have better mood these days but for me everytime spring and sunny warmer days hits my depression gets very worse at least for a few weeks. I know about seasonal depression and spring asthenia but I think this is another thing. Many days I need to close the courtains and stay in the darkness. Only the night is a relief for me.,Depression
39698,yeah so basically me and my bf both have been in a very good relationship for about a year and month and we were just texting like we normally do every night and he told me that he s suicidal and think about hurting himself a lot how do i deal with this information how can i help him he already said he doesn t want to go to therapy since that would require him telling his parent and i assume he s really embarrassed about it so what can i do to help him i ve never had to deal with anything like this before so i have no idea,Depression

22863,Hey...28 Year Old Male here..I just feel so tired and confused. 13 Years with Major Depression and it is basically sapped my energy away to the point of never having 1 day where I do not feel tired. Constantly laying in bed trying to get out of it only to fall right back into it.. Insomnia and Excessive Sleepiness haunt my life..At work it is not any better...I do a Laborious Job and constantly feeling drained of energy while on the job makes me feel like I am not enough despite there being older people than me there who do not really feel tired...I have a constant feeling of disassociation feeling like I do not belong in my own body...like my mind has been only added to it...I constantly see shadows or things that are not there and it is driving me insane sometimes..I constantly forget things when it is just been told to me and I hate it! I feel so..stupid for not remembering anything...I try so hard to remember what I just forgot but it never comes back...I cannot even remember special things unless it is in writing...I feel like I am combatting myself.. Like I have two different personalities mixed into one. My personality before depression when I was a Teenager as a Freshman in High School and after depression hit... there is the Empathetic Helpful Patient side and then there is the Depressive Side where I am prone to being numb very irritated easy to anger and just plain not caring about myself. it is...making me feel so...disconnected.I feel so bad when I get very irritated and mad at my Mom for not understanding my depression and just needing help on the same things I tell her about...she is forgetful sometimes and she needs time to understand...it is not her fault...I feel like a bad son sometimes...Then there is the heavy guilt and anxiety...I feel like I cannot control it even with the Medication I am taking...I feel like such a mess that nobody should be bothering with..All of this just makes me feel so disconnected from people...I want to be alone...but I do not at the same time... it is like my mind does not know what it wants anymore...I cannot even play MMORPGs and other genres of games I enjoy without feeling like I want to drop them as fast I got into them. it is so stressful and annoying...Even though I have a Job a Loving Relationship of 5 Years Family Members that I guess still care about me..I do not even care about myself. I still do not know what it means be truly happy...it never lasts..I always have to put up a Facade to avoid having to explain myself or worry people..I only recently found out what this is.. Smiling Depression I always one day hope I will not have to act like I am completely fine and stable but everyday that hope dwindles till only nothing is left.. I feel like I should not exist. Sorry for ranting and getting how I feel off my chest...I should not be bothering anyone with this and should just suffer with it on my own... I hate myself I do not know who I am anymore I feel broken because I do not feel true happiness and I feel alone..,Depression
7987,Headline says it all not going to go into detail because its pathetic. Why am I so hard to love? I am way too ugly andor pathetic. At this point I do not even want to believe it anymore. Even though we made fun of each other all the time and recently been sexual. I have always thought how perfect and great they were. Even now I respect him too much to even bother for an explanation or anything. I really hope I get over this and I hope his life gets better too since I know his struggle too. I wanted to be his best friend but I know I cannot since I have always wanted something more. I just need to stop being in his life for both of our sakes Getting rejected after confessing your love from childhood fucking sucks,Depression
19184,I consider myself functionally depressed however what can really get to me are the lonely nights.The solitude is equally peaceful yet disconcerting I struggle with passive suicidal ideation so being all by my lonesome I find it easier to justify my logic of being better off dead and not existing at all. The people i see day to day are nonexistent I think of how eventually everything I know and love will be dead no matter what and it just makes me not even want to try anymore. Even trying to care for myself and better myself everything feels so futile in the end. I get torn between not wanting to leave but not wanting to be here either. Even now I tried to just shut down and sleep it off but I cannot so I sit here sondering and contemplating only to conclude that overall nothing matters and it would be easier to give up. Nights can be difficult when you cannot sleep,Depression
21482,I cannot shake this feeling that my friend is using me to buy them things? I told them I already spent a gargantuan amount of money on my new car a game for them and some other essentials I need such as meds etc. etc.. Not to mention some other expensive things I have bought for them in the past. But they kept dismissing me saying Ill have the money by the holidays when I tried to say no. They also said and I am do not know if they were joking that I cannot disappoint them this year. They also have not been on their medication lately so their playful insults come at me more often. Which honestly triggered my depression enough to contemplate well.... you know..I really do not know what to do.... I feel like my friend is using me for materialistic items and money...,Depression
9540,A friend with depression talks to everyone except me out of a sudden. Does anyone know why ? Need advice,Depression
8103,I am so tired of depression. One of the worst feelings i have lately is knowing if i did not feel this way so often i would be so much better of a person. I notice how much it holds me back and i always just picture would i could do and what i would be capable of if i did not feel this way all the time. I have had a few years in my life where i actually did feel ok and my head felt clear. I just wish i had that back Just tired,Depression
12470,I just do not know what to say. Since I was let us say half a year in homeschooling and lockdown I have lost all my social skills. I do not know how to lead a normal conversation I do not know how to keep my stories interesting and the worst of all I completely forgot how to undertand the thoughts and words of the person that is talking to me.That would not be a that big problem if I would not overthink everything all the time. That started since I was in quarantine no social contacts too. I was actually or am an extrovert person and I love to talk to my friends. But now it became less and as I said I do not even know how to lead on a conversation. it is always my mission to start one but I just cannot. And with my overthinking I am not just unsatisfied with a bad dialogue. No my stupid head is tearing every little word apart just to see if there was a insult or a sign that the person does not like me.it is so surreal. I mean I KNOW that I like my friends. I love them since they are a better family for me and I pay every price to make them happpy. And my friends like me. But... then there is my head that is not acting or thinking the way I want.This is seriously damaging my relationships since I often act offended even though there was NOTHING. And I do not want to do this. I do not want to play the victim in this because there is NO victim. But... I just cannot. There is something that just acts and does not think.My relationsship with two of my friends is damaged because they did some shit to me... I in person want to forgive them. I said this. But I always think about it. I always think about how they left me and now be like hey we are friends right?. I am not the same since they left me once and I told them but they cannot fix this of course. It happened and I want to overcome this. But my head just makes me feel different than what I really want... I am just so confused. I also get angry so much faster. Or let us say frustrated. it is so bad with me and I am always ashamed afterwards... I never want to hurt my friends this way and I hope that is not the reason why they are talking less to me.I do not have fun with my hobbies anymore. I do not appreciate the things I liked before. The only times I appreciate my time is while I can talk to people especially my friends. But I just stand in my own way for a better view... I hate overthinking my unability to read people and that I cannot forgive,Depression
17562,CPS came to take my sisters kids yesterday. I thought the house was clean enough. They did not. I have no one to help me. My life is in shambles,Depression
8579,No matter how hard I try to turn my life around I lose. Dissapointment is all I have ever felt. I am so close to just giving up on this living thing Will things ever get better? I need someone to tell my I have to live right now.,Depression
25287,I left home yesterday with the intention of not coming back. After hours of driving around and mentally going to hell and back I did come home. In the past when this type of thing happened there was a relief of survival and even a little hope. This time feels very different I now feel like I was not supposed to come back home and now I am living on borrowed time. Anyone else with experience in this? Borrowed time,Depression
18484,TW self harm thoughts suicidal thoughtsI knew I was starting to crash yesterday and today I did okay enough right after I woke up but by the time I got to IOP I started spiraling. Just so much anxiety feeling overwhelmed for literally no reason to the point I was rocking back and forth and wanted to pull my hair out. I am fucking sick of this. Why do people want me to live through this? Urges and urges to self harm. Intrusive thoughts of what Id want to do in graphic detail. I do not understand the fucking point. They say I am low insight but I think its bullshit. There is no reason I should not self harm. Scarring? What does it fucking matter my body is valueless. It does not solve the problem. So what? It makes me feel better. It helps me get out these feelings. I do not want to live with them. I do not want to sit with suck as my therapist said. If I could do that I would not have gone inpatient and spent 2 months in residential. The best I have been able to do lately is fucking starve myself lol which has made me even more sick and miserable. But at least its something. Maybe Ill be able to manage making an attractive corpse lol. Doubtful.I see my family everyday and I wish I could look them in the face and beg them to just let me go. Just accept it and cherish the good memories and let me leave. I do not understand why they cannot just let me go.I am sick of dopamine chasing. I am fucking sick of it. Quick fix satisfaction like some fucking junkie. I am sick of being delusional and dreaming some day I will not live with this fucking mental illness. I am so fucking sick of being crazy man. I am fucking sick of it. I did not ask for this. This is not fair. I want it to be over and I had the opportunity so many times and I never fucking did it because I am a fucking pussy.Whatever. Ill just keep dopamine chasing and saying that is enough. Listening to music is soooooooo worth it If you like industrial stuff I am listening to Between Breaths An XX Perspective by Blaqk Audio on repeat before trying to fall asleep. Life is hard. Holding out hope that things will get better is so difficult,Depression
38982,i worry a lot about thing like getting into a car crash getting cancer and just anything bad happening to me any advice on hot to stop this it s bad,Depression
10526,Due to a bad childhood horrible socializing skills as a kid and other things in between I fucking suck at emotionally connecting to anyone. I do not have any attachments to my family since my bad childhood mostly involves them. I only have 4 close friends and they are amazing ones but I have only really connected to and opened up to 1. I could easily relate to her and we could talk for hours on end. We took a few month break for her to focus on her mental health. Now that were talking again it just feels like we lack the connection we use to have. I still cherish her and everything but sometimes it just feels one sided but I cannot blame her. She recently got a lot of new friends and just has a busy life in general. My 3 other friends while close I have only opened up to one and that was ages ago. When I did his parents saw my messages told the school principal who then proceeded to call my mom which made some issues for me. Ever since then the only person I have opened up to is the friend I mentioned first. I have talked to her about some of my issues but I do not want to burden her. She already feels guilty for not being there during our break. My last 2 remaining friends its hard to open up to since I have never talked to them about this stuff at all at least on my side. The best thing about the emotional connection I had with my friend originally was that it made me feel happy unlike anything else. It made me feel like I was living. I still feel that way when we have a fun time with each other or have a good convo but now its just a double edge sword to me with the sad feelings that come with it. I do not have anyone else to rely on to relate to or anyone there for me. I do not think me and her will ever go back to way that we were before and that scares me. I would have no connections then. I would just be a sack of flesh walking on this earth. Suicidal ideas have came back. I know I am a wimp when it comes to this stuff I could not self harm even if I wanted to but maybe the cowardice will run out sometime soon. Until then I have time to brainstorm lots of ideas I wish I could Have More Emotional Connections,Depression
37745,i m not sure of even how to put it into word i m exhausted i ve moved into my own place i ve recently started a new job i m overwhelmed i don t want to die but i also feel like i don t want to exist if that make sense i m trying my best but at this point i feel like my best isn t actually my best i m not sure how to fight these feeling of inadequacy or how to fight off regret over thing i have acknowledged my mistake i ve made and will never make them again but somehow still manage to beat myself up and regret every mistake i ve ever made i hate feeling like this can i just not be tired for one day not be overwhelmed for a day,Depression
18001,I am in a weird mood regarding all this and I will start off by saying I know I fucked up. I knew I was fucking up as I was doing it and at the time I did not care.I fell in love with a girl who was not available. I thought she was awesome so I asked her out and she politely turned me down saying she had a boyfriend. I was willing to leave it there but as the time went on she kept flirting with me. Told me she wanted to leave her boyfriend and be with me. Told me she loved me. Told me she wanted to move in with me. And I believed her.Until today when I got news that she is pregnant. And she is staying with him.I am 26 years old. Never been in a relationship. Every time I have tried I have gotten hurt in exactly this way. And I knew going in that there was a chance a good chance even that this would end the same way. And I did it anyway because I thought this time would be different. I believed this time would be different.I cut myself for the first time today. I have been depressed since I was a child but I never really saw the appeal. Now I do.I am going to move forward. I am going to work my way through this pain and keep searching for the one who is not going to hurt me. But that does not mean it does not hurt now. I want to give up and just die in a hole and it hurts even worse because I know I will not. I know that I will get up brush myself off and keep on going even though that is not what I want.I do not know or care who you are. I do not know why you are reading this. But if you are please pray for me. Because I am a good person who falls in love too easily and I need some kindness now more than ever.I have learned my lesson. Now I just want it to stop hurting. I gave everything I had,Depression
20247,I want to be gone. I do not want to be here. I wish no one knew me or had any attachment to me because I just want to be gone without them hurting. I am honestly hanging on by a thread I wish nobody knew me,Depression
14144,Since I was in quarantine and homeschooling my social skills got worse and worse. I used to be funny and knew how to start a conversation out of nowhere. The boys of my friendgroup started to seek a different group than mine so I was really pissed because they had no time for me anymore. I really tried to forgive. I am still trying to forgive them. it is just... I just cannot. They left me in my phase where I needed friends. I even told them that I need them. But nothing changed. They even forgot my birthday that we spoke about 2 days earlier. I just feel like I am worthless. Now their group ripped apart because of really fucked up shit and it is no surprise that they are with me again. And as I said I just want to forgive. Somehow. But I.. I just cannot. Something in me says it cannot. We met again we played games again but somehow... it is not the same. I am always nervous and somehow frustrated when I am with the boys. It get's better after some time but if I think about the past again what happens often I am in a downphase again like now. Tomorrow is the birthday of one of my friends. I will congratulate him but there is just something inside me that makes me constantly angry when I think about his birthday. There is something that makes me sad when I think about my friends. My relation to my other friends who are girls is fine I guess. Even though my overthinking and lack of conversation skill really damaged it I think. I just do not have the strong bond I used to have. And I am never sure if it is me or the friend. They have problems too because of the whole lockdown thing so I am pretty sure that it is mostly because of this. But way too often my thoughts are not the same that I am feeling what makes some days really hard. After all I think they like me in a way but then there is my overthinking. Every word they say and every movement just triggers something inside me. I immediately think about it and take it as an insult or think of a sign that our relation is bad. And I think that is the actual thing that destroys my relations and I just do not know how to handle... I just do not want to loose them... I just do not have clear thoughts and wanted to vent a bit... This is so confusing for me and I do not know how to handle my feelings. Do you have same kinds of feelings and thoughts? Do you have ideas how to handle them? I wish you guys all the best with every problem you have. The world is cruel but after all I am confident that every person can fix it is own little perception to the world and make it a better place lt3 Why cannot I forgive my friends? I know they did shit but I really want to forgive them,Depression
11274,Ppl no longer have to interact anymore. there is an online virtual world built by ppl who have a job where those with mental illness can go. We do not have to talk to ppl. We do not have to interact. We have the world at our fingertips. And yet. Its completely unsatisfying. All I want is connection. Ppl no longer have to interact anymore,Depression
47534,ExhaustedTired all the time in denial So I am a 36 year old male. I have had depression on and off my entire life. More on than off but my off periods were fantastic. I was capable of pure joy. Energy. Zest. I could be the person that lights up a room. Sorry to toot my own horn. I have always however had health anxiety. Worried about this and that many medical tests etc.Over the last year other than the 2 months I was on Zyprexa which I guess should be very telling I am exhausted beyond belief. I am crying all the time. I almost never feel wellrested. I want to sleep all day. But even when I try to nap I rarely fall asleep. I just lie there and remain exhausted. Physically so exhausted. Last year I had a stupid pulmonologist sometimes they dabble in sleep medicine suggest to me that I had narcolepsy. As a person with health anxiety this was terrifying. I got 34 separate medical opinions ALL of them from major Universities. They all said I didn't even close to have narcolepsy and that It was my depression causing it. My tests overnight sleep study and daytime nap study weren't close. I didn't believe them. I was in denial. I think because I used to have times when I felt great and the depression lifted this had to be something different.However if I try to look at things objectively I have to see that in the last year I have become a caretaker for my mother with ALS who is rapidly progressing I have become more isolated and hang out with friends less and haven't been working on my passion music as much. Has anyone else gone through depression denial and tried to find a medical explanation for their somatic symptoms lethargy exhaustion brain fog crying all the time only to get every medical test in the book and have all doctors and friends and family that know you best and love you tell you its depression?side note I went for a run while crying lol yesterday for the first time in two years and it totally took away my brain fog. I still feel tired but I feel clearer. That was new.,Depression
17007,When I was barely over the age of one cps took me away from my birth mom. Needless to say I was found in a terrible state. The very first family to take me in as a foster child eventually they were able to adopt me when I was 3. Sadly though I was forced to continue my relationship with my mother throughout the years I was a foster child which was ultimately detrimental in how I ended up. Luckily it was a closed adoption sadly though the parents who had adopted me had divorced a few years later. My mom got me and the other kids while occasionally we would see our dad. Though my mother would rarely let me see my father. It was obvious from the start I was different from other kids. I look back on it and I realize just how much of a struggle I had to deal with. I attended special classes for my speech impediment I was always getting bad grades and I just did not understand ANYTHING. Instead of getting me help my mother did not believe in medicine or doctors. I just recently found out that she knew I always had ADD but never told me. She would ground me for not crying when someone I did not love would die. I was always getting grounded and I was never allowed inside the house. No matter how hydrated I would get she would not allow me inside and she worked me like a slave. Only ever cleaning when I was inside. Eventually I ended up living with my dad and his new wife when I became a teen. I ended up getting caught having sex and my father who was extremely strict grounded me for years. I started getting treated like I was a dirty person and that they would not feel comfortable allowing such a person around their kids. And to this day I am still treated like this. What more I went back and forth between my mom and dad eventually I was kicked out before I could graduate and have struggled ever since. I always struggled with depression but as soon as I became an adult I started truly feeling suicidal and depressed. I started coming out to my family who I have Always had a rocky relationship with and was always shut down and told to stick it up. They ignored my pain and suffering and I refused to ever ask help from any of them. But my sister would always have my back she would make sure I would not be homeless. And now I just find myself in a rut. I am in the first relationship I have had for years and its terrible. He deceived me into believing he was someone else and like an idiot I feel for it. he is made us get into tremendous debt and now I find myself the lowest I could ever be. I have no motivation and I know I just cannot keep doing it anymore. I am tired and I do not care to live. I do not care what happens after this I just want to be set free from this misery. I also cannot help but resent my father he has so much money yet he refuses to help anyone. He says to work hard even if it means work 247 since he is an alcoholic. But I just struggle so much and the fact that he is out there spending ridiculous amounts of money on the dumbest of stuff but not on helping out his child that is struggling so much who finally admitted to him that I have been suicidal.I have come to realize that all the abuse I went through as a child has damaged me in a way that I can never hope to be normal. I still have a speech impediment but I have learned to become the silent character. I know that I have some form of autism I have looked up all the signs and I have worked so hard to understand myself. I do not want to be here anymore and I guess really I just want to be heard. Wanting Permission to Die,Depression
13958,I finally achieved a longterm goal but I am so damn depressed. After grinding for years I realize that I do not have friends nor have I dated. I neglected my personal needs in pursuit of a career.I have worked in toxic environments for years and now my mental health is shot. I basically have been in abusive situations for years.I live at home in an attempt to save money. I have lackluster social skills.I am starting to feel resentful towards my success. I feel robbed of happiness and I fear that the future will still suck. Even achieving success depresses me,Depression
22089,I felt motivated today and decided to write this My therapist told me a while ago that one seemingly small useless step is still a full step! And I thought this was actually really comforting advice. So let me explainWe often compare ourselves to others. Other people who might be very active have intense social life big dreams or the perfect job. They might live healthy and have energy to exercise and it seems like they have everything under control every single day. To someone with depression this seems impossible to 'compete' with. For someone with depression something as simple as getting out of bed and washing yourself may seem exhausting. Social interactions on a bad day? No thank you do not have the energy. So try to look at situations this way One small step is still a full step. Making your bed instead of doing chores all day is still one made bed! Eating one meal instead of starving yourself is still a full meal!Brushing your teeth when you do not feel like taking care of yourself is still an important part of personal hygiene!! Having one productivegood day in a bad week is still a full productive day! On a bad day make a list of your accomplishments. And do not think I only did one thing. Think Yes I did this whole thing!! or You know what... atleast I did xxx. Be kind to yourself because depression is a bitch who already makes your life hard enough. do not compare yourself to others only compare them to yourself if you had not taken that step today! I hope this might give you a tiny bit of power to make that step. I hope I did not break any of the subreddit rules please let me know if I did. motivation One small step!,Depression
8586,My GF suffers from bad depression. She had become very distant and to me it felt like she was pushing me away. She started a new job and went really quiet. I took it as she had lost interest in me and I broke up with her. She could not seem to make time for me and I left for a trip and we had very little contact after I left. It seemed to me that she had no interest in having a conversation with me. She said that she thought I needed space but idk why she would of thought that. She had became distant months ago and became more so as time passed. I am curious to know if this could be normal behavior of someone who is feeling overwhelmed and is moving through depression. All I wanted was to be there for her and to feel that she still cared. Once it felt like she did not care anymore I could not do it any longer. I was very patient with her and would let her initiate any plans to hang out My GF was moving through a bad time of depression,Depression

16493,After having a great month then dipping and talking to friends about it I felt like a foolburden and decided to just tell people I am better again. But I am not. Some days are better than others. I am still seeing my therapist but I am really trying hard to not burden my friends anymore. I want to talk to my friends and tell them the truth.. but I am trying to so hard to be strong and get people to have normal conversations. I understand people are busy.. but then why they do not respond I start overthinking I have lost friends because of my depression.

11713,I want to be prescribed a med that will take the edge off and make me less nervous and anxious and will also take depression away. Simultaneously I also want to take something that will make it harder to laugh. One thing I always do frequently is laugh when I am bored or want to feel happy. But since I live up under my parents one of my parents are starting to feel like my laughter is annoying. It is not uncontrollable laughter but it is noticed by one of them and they feel my wanting to laugh is annoying. I want to tell the doctor that I laugh without him thinking I am manic.. I do not want him to send me to some other thing I have to pay for because he thinks it is manic laughter. But I do want to be able to convince him that I need an anti depressentanti anxiety med that will make laughing something that is harder to do. What should I tell the doctor?,Depression
48153,I'm a horrible person. I've been fighting with my mom often. It's taking a big toll on the both of us and I've recently started to think that she might be right about how I am selfish and horrible to her. I'm so tired of things at this point and has thought of ending things multiple times. Telling her how I feel and think never is possible because I get so scared. I'm such a bad person where I can't even respect my mom but also so useless as I get to scared to end things.,Depression

39447,i want to share something my therapist told me that really resonated and stuck with me she said anxiety is like a smoke detector it go off whenever there smoke to keep you safe but a smoke detector doesn t know the difference between a fire or burnt toast so it s our job to identify what s making the alarm go off and how to manage it most of the time it just burnt toast even if you panic when the alarm first ring you soon realise it burnt toast though difficult anxiety sometimes just need u to take a second to identify the source and put it into perspective is it manageable what s the best way for me to approach it without avoiding it so yeah burnt toast,Depression
25058,I struggle with feelings of emptiness and cannot find a tool to help me come back to life. During these times life feels so pointless boring and lonesome. I no longer give a damn about anything and I feel like a zombie dead inside. Due to the sudden drop in motivation I fall behind on schoolwork neglect daily responsibilities and underperform at work. Even my relationships fall apart as my attachment fades.Do you struggle with this too?Have you found any tools to reduce the deadness and feel alive again? I have tried mindfulness meditation apps and emotion trackers but neither of them breaks through the deafening numbness. Tools to reduce emptiness,Depression

13333,My big bro is a role model to me he is got a house a girlfriend a job and he is well paid he is got a strong personality and each member of our family admires him. he is also very attached to my two sisters one older one younger he talks to them a lot. But for me its another story I am the weirdest of the sisters weird in a bad way and I just feel like he hates me our conversations are so blank our message text can be resumed as do not forget your meds yes I will come over at xxpm okay! Everytime he talks about our sisters its always about the happy things that happened to them when its about me its often about the weird shit I did as a kid. Once he said you were a piece of shit when you were a kid. We are currently at our grandma's house for holidays he came over to say hi and when he left he said goodbye to my little sister and ignored me turned his back and went to his car.I just do not know what to do. Is it depression that make me think that way? Maybe its my actions as a child that reflect today I am really confused and completely lost. I think my big brother hates me,Depression
20618,I am feeling so hopeless right now and I do not have anybody to talk to. No one understands. I am just lazy to them or dumb or both.

I am just laying there crying feeling useless because I did not do anything the last couple days and now I have to write everything until tomorrow and its such an impossible task and I hate what I wrote until now and I will hate everything Ill write from there. I just hate myself and everything and I cannot stop crying and I really just need to pull a 20 hour shift of writing a thesis only for it to be utterly bad. Its already in the evening here and I have not done the bare minimum until now. What is wrong with me why am I like this? I cannot concentrate anymore I cannot focus to write such an amount of pages in such a short time. I completely fucked up. Again. I hate myself. I need motivation so bad right now but I just cannot find it. Its too late. I just need to vent,Depression

But I love my mother and she raised me when the rest of my family was absent we only had ourselves during my childhood and early teenage years. I cannot do that to her we talk everyday and she is so glad when I laugh she wants to believe I am not a lost because so bad but I am. I cannot hate myself more than I do I am a worthless piece of shit and I hate existing with all my sick mind and body I am 27 I lived long enough I want to stop this right now. The only reason is my mom,Depression

25528,36 m here. 20 years of major depression GAD OCD etc. due to bad childhood and trauma. I grew up raised by an alcoholic single mother who emotionally abused me even when i was already an adult.Now I occasionally realise that I am out of juice and still trying my best to please and emotionally support my wife. She has bipolar and BPD although that is well in control now. I work and study in order to better support us financially since she cannot work. I do chores and try to energize her to help. Today i sat with her at the kitchen table eating food i had made just her in mind and her silence and empty stare into nothingness just broke me. I suddenly thought of how I am fighting a battle I cannot win and that whatever i do is useless she is not emotionally present and she will abandon me eventually. All of a sudden I wanted to kill myself although everything is fine. Nothing I do will ever make her take the same initiative that I have or make her go through shitstorms to please me like I have done for her and I will have to either live with this or abandon her which is the last thing i want to do because she is very vulnerable. I wanted today to be a nice day for us it is my day off and now all I do is hold back my tears and feel like shit.Just today's thoughts. Giving my all while out of energy and empty,Depression
16783,Even when I try to do homework I just stare at it for hours. It does not help that it is somewhat hard and I am behind already. I am pretty much looking for anything I can readily getuse. Pills foods whatever. I am close to graduating but depression has caused it to take much longer than needed and even with just a year left I am on the verge of dropping out of college. How do I motivate myself to do homework?,Depression
37750,i know they have good intention but lot of the time they make me feel worse i don t like it when they ask too many question when i withdraw yet when i go to tell them my actual problem they indirectly tell me to get over it and don t think im depressed sometimes it seems like my mood is an inconvenience for them so they want me to be happy so they can be happy it s draining i m tired of them being nosy when when i need to be alone stop asking me to who i m talking to stop asking me what i m doing when i m not doing anything stop looking at my stuff and asking me question stop getting upset with me for being in a bad mood or trying to force me to be happy again i can t this is why i hate socializing with anyone in general it take up too much energy that i don t have and i m tired of having to hide whatever this heaviness i m feeling inside to make others happy i m tired of being the caretaker and human note pad to vent at all day i m tired of putting on a mask and pretending to be happy when i feel like garbage i hate myself i m tired all the time i feel like a failure and a waste of space i just want to be alone i don t want anyone to look at me,Depression
18393,I hate it when Someone tries to commit but lives and the first thing your gaurdian says is why do you want to die... like we do t want to diewe just want the pain to end. I hate this....,Depression
23288,Everyone around me is better than I am and I know its true. I am nothing I am useless,Depression
48255,does it ever get better? i 23F have been struggling with my mental health since i was 13. i started taking sertraline for anxiety about two years ago which helps some but not for the panic attacks. ive started mirtazapine for sleeping which helps. but the depression is something that hasnt gone away. most days its manageable. im good for a couple weeks i do my schoolwork i clean im motivated to do everything and anything i feel amazing. then for a couple weeks its bad again i struggle to get up and go to school my rooms a disaster i shut down and it just seems like ill always be in this cycle.,Depression
17337,I was bullied like almost everyone else and ever since life was different. I always thought there was a predefined mindset that I had to get myself to believe in to be happy like ''I do not care what others think etc.. But that is bullshit affirmations do not work and they will never work because they do not change anything in your life.Everything somebody else can do for you is give you an explanation on why your brain is the way it is. There are no supplements Affirmations meditations drugs Therapies that will make a significant change.If you do not physically change something in your life everything will stay the same.Being bullied left me in an unconsciouss shame state that followed me everywhere. what is the easiest and most reliable way to live with Trauma? Coping strategies. My coping strategies were Videogames and social media.The bad thing in your life are not the circumstances its how you react to them. Lock them up cope them away with addictions perform compulsions evade them at any cost will never ever change something.Be clever and start recognising what your coping strategies are and just do not commit to them anymore. No affirmations necessary your brain will sort things through by itself.Coping strategies are basically everything that make you feel good immediately your smartphone food drugs.... If you do not try to stop your coping then you are not allowed to ask for help in my eyes because you should know what to do.How can you heal in circumstances that made you that way?You will notice that your life might get very silent even lonely. But that is just the demons you locked away. You will learn to regulate your emotions again. Shame is the Key emotion why mental illness is so prevalent nowadays. This is how the sequence usually goesTraumagtShamegtcoping strategiesgtaddictionsgtdepression ocd anxiety borderline extreme narcissm... What your mental illness will be in the end depends on the person some might get ocd and do compulsive information seeking some might become grandiose narcissists and completely ignore their problem and just make it their daily life to get affirmation from others on social media.that is the thing about self esteem It does not need a reason.Narcissism always needs a reason mostly multiple times a day a. What does your brain need its emotional regulation for if you perform instant reward coping strategies instead? If you are as desperate as I was you should take my advice seriously. It will not be enjoyable but that is what life is like.What if instant rewards would have been accessible in ancient times? The people would not have evolved and would probably have died because nobody wants to work for long term goals if there are instant rewards. Everyone is responsible for their own mental health.Get off the internet use it only for important things. Buy an old Phone without internet. Move out of your parents house if you have not already. Learn to be alone with yourself again. Live for yourself. do not depend on other people for your happiness. If you do not help yourself nobody will because no one can anyways. What 99 of your problems are caused by,Depression
8570,I am grateful for everything I have in life I genuinely believe I am blessed. Yet I feel empty and sad all the time. I never used to be like this until 2017. Its been like that for years now and it just will not go away. I had a expectation of how my adult life would turn out but I am still not satisfied. I was told twenties would be your most fun for me its the most depressing at most times. When I do enjoy life in the moment it kind of gets ruined by the thought knowing it will not last forever. I am really grateful for my so hes very supportive and understanding yet I still feel constant sadness.. I am not suicidal but I always feel empty and nothing. I hate this feeling and it makes me cry at some nights whereas other nights I cannot cry at all. Anyways.. I just want rant on here. Its my first time posting on this app. I have everything I want but I am still constantly depressed.,Depression
47732,The last dip Hey guys So my long term partner just broke up with me today. I dont blame her I was emotionally crazy and always depressed. She was my only friend and my only light sometimes but I know I put her off a lot. I understand my faults. I usually would go to the gym and stuff but I dont hate this girl or feel wronged. If anything I wronged her by taking her for granted. Either ways I feel all alone. I have no one and no one close enough or comfortable enough to talk to and confess my emotions to.I guess its just me and my crazy thoughts from now on then.,Depression
25674,I feel like a failure I hate my life. I am all alone lost my girlfriend lost my job. I want all this pain to end I do not know why I keep going. I am just reminded of her I miss her I want to be with her. I cry every night wishing I still could talk to her. I am never going to be happy No future for me,Depression
11282,I 20f just got diagnosed with anxiety and depression mainly because I finally went to my doctor about it. After my initial screening I was diagnosed put on medicine and referred to a therapist. I am happy I finally got the help I needed since I have been dealing with this for majority of my life however after two weeks of seeing my therapist she told me I was emotionally abused by my mother. I always had a feeling I was but I guess it was a shocker to hear it from someone other than my brother. Now my therapist wants me to write about my childhood and everything I remember about it. This is terrifying to me because I normalized everything I was dealing with and now I realize that what I went through was not normal at all. I guess I am just scared to relive everything and realize how much I actually went through. If you have any tips please let me know. I just got diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I have mixed feelings,Depression
18148,And why?Who here has molina and likes their care? I have kaiser and want to switch because its not enough. I need weekly therapy and for a long time. Any molina patients are welcome to offer any feedback thanks Kaiser vs. Molina who offers better Psychiatric care?,Depression
12182,Of course I pretend to feel happy around most people. But even when I am with someone who knows I am depressed I have to pretend? Like if I am eating with my friends and look happy then they will probably think I just say I am depressed for attention because I seem happy but if I actually look depressed then they will think it is attention seeking for them to ask me if I am okay or something like that. So I try to look like I am trying to look happy but failing cuz then they will know I am depressed but trying to look happy if that makes sense. I have to pretend even with my psychologist because if I look happy then they will not take me seriously but if I look always depressed they will think I do not listen to them. Same with my sister she tries to help me but if I look too happy she will think I was just pretending to have depression but if I look depressed then I am not even trying to feel better. It happens all the time and I do not even know if I am honest with myself. I always feel like I am pretending something,Depression
9241,it is annoying I have gotten used to the pain I have received but it still lives on in me and the pain anger and anguish come out at certain times. It feels like a tight sharp tingly aching pain. People say it is a medical condition but no it is not. I have gotten it checked before but it all comes down to the emotional stress I have suffered over the years. Anyone know how to get rid of this? How do you get rid of the chest pain???,Depression

27230,23 year old male here. I just found out that life is extremely boring and those tiny little moments of joy are very few and you just cannot force them to happen. I have been always fascinated in creating stuff to entertain myself and others because LIFE IS JUST too boring. But I burned out and I had to leave my creative part behind only to burn out again doing traditional BORING work. I was always the weirdcrazy cousin who would host hounted attractions in my bedroom just to keep my other cousins entertained. I had an iCarly.com ripoff kind of website that I created with some friends when I was barely 10. I made a lot of videos and movies using Sims characters and Habbo characters. I used to play a lot as a kid and had fun. I know all of that sounds stupid but the point is that I USED to be creative and joyful at some point of my life. But as always LIFE happened. I grew up I developed a bunch of insecurities became a nerd I turned out to be gay I fell apart developed a porn addiction my social anxiety started to rise stopped hanging out with my childhood ex friends put all of my teen energy on having good grade and after graduating I decided to go into Business since I knew that I would be a financial burden to my single unemployed mother had I chosen a career related to Film amp Arts in a third world country. But now I graduated from college I did great thankfully tho and I have been working at a bank for more than year dealing with coding and database of which I had no previous experienceknowledge on while working remotely due to covid spending most of my days locked in my room feeling empty stressed out and suicidal at how my life has turned out. I told to myself that next year I would apply to an international scholarship to do a master's degree because everyone in my circle is persuing that and I do not want to fall behind. But I still do not even know the master's degree I want to do. I am stuck. It makes no sense to persue a master's degree in arts after graduating from Business School. I hate this gray career path that my 18 year old naive self chose and my 23 year old self decided to maintain. I feel like a zombie hair falling out agong fast nothing makes sense I am extremely bored I struggle doing minimal stuff. But I feel stuck and Idk what to do. I have been thinking about building an online social media platform to have an audience and monetize it so that I can become my own boss. But I still do not know what it will be about. I am sick of boring stuff. I feel stuck and I do not know how long I Will put of with this. Reality is too boring for me so that kind of explains why I struggle to be mindful Reality is too DAMN boring for me!,Depression

26961,that is it right?I mean I deserve this pain. I must want this or Id try to escape it. So if I want this and I have it then its my fault. And if its my fault then I deserve it. And if I deserve it then its right.And no matter how dark things get or how horrible it all feels. At least I know I deserve it. And that when one day this kills me Ill deserve that too. I deserve this,Depression

I cannot even kill myself,Depression

Or did your astheticsmusic choices change when your depression symptoms were relieved? I'm a metal head grew up emopunk. It's my biggest personality trait and music is my main hobbypassion.

25562,Today was my birthday and I could not stop thinking about hurting myself. Had a horrible panic attack 10 minutes into break and ended up leaving my friends to sit in a toilet cubicle alone all lunch. I used to self harm years ago but it is not a significant aspect of my life at all anymore. Now things have been getting really bad the urges are here again. I have barely been eating sleeping either 12 hours or not at all only attending a few classes a week being generally reckless on purpose.Its like my brain is on autopilot I do not have the energy to be fully present anymore. I am exhausted trying so hard not to spiral. Urges when things get bad,Depression
22682,I am a 34 year old woman who is a virgin. I have not kissed a guy in nine years and I have not gone on a date in a while. I am not having any luck on dating apps. I gained weight during the pandemic and I feel like crap because I have not lost it. I feel like such a loser. Everything is opening up again and I still have the same problems. My Dad is home now after surgery and its gotten even worse. I almost ended up in the hospital last week. The doctor was smart enough to realize the cops overreacted. I had not been transported to the hospital since 2017 and they still did it anyway because it had happened in the past. I just feel so isolated from everyone. I do not have anyone to talk to or spend time with. I feel guilty for venting to my friend she is starting to think I am an overactive bitch.I stopped working to try and focus on home and it has not helped much. I really do not want to go back to where I was working because I felt like they did not care how uncomfortable I was there. I had a table instead of a desk. My desk was in a walk in closet along with a copier a microwave a refrigerator and the paper storage. I was facing towards the wall so I never knew who was behind me. You have to walk past the closet to get to HR and I could hear peoples HR discussions which made me feel uncomfortable. People also left medical forms lying around. I just felt like I had no privacy or space and was constantly invading other peoples privacy. But my boss did not seem to think it was a problem. I could not even move my chair back without hitting the fridge. Not to mention having to smell other peoples food.I have done interviews and heard nothing. I feel like the pandemic killed any career momentum I had. I am giving to be 35 soon and I am just worried its too late for me to do the things I want to do like being in a rock band and tour the country find love and get married buy my own house in a place I want to live and have a job where I can grow and have a future. It just feels like the doors are closing and time is running out. I am so depressed right now. I wish I knew when this feeling would end. I am worried its too late for me,Depression
10384,I am so sad all the time I hate it. My relationship with my family only gets worse every day and I am losing the only friend I have had in a long time. No one cares about me anymore and I feel like I am just in limbo waiting to die. Why is it so wrong to just put myself out of my misery if I am suffering? I do not want to be here anymore and people tell me it is going to be okay when it never will. it is been so long. It never gets better. I just want to be done with everything. I am so done with everything,Depression
26345,I do not normally post these sort of things but figured I would give it a try.So here we goI am 30 years old live with my parents and I am in a low paying job that I am making no progress in but cannot just pack in. Things have not seemed to go right for many years would not be surprised if it is my own damn fault but there you go.I suffered from Crohn's disease ulcerative colitis unclear which as a teenager. Fortunately we managed to get it into remission but now I suffer with IBS which is less serious but still very uncomfortable irritating and humiliating. I think there is other things wrong but my gastroentorologist said no.I had wonderful long curly hair as a teenager now at 30 it has receded and thinned to the extent that I have less hair than a sphinx cat. Whilst I have come to terms with this and believe me it took a while it is still annoying to have this happen at such a young age.I have been a heavy drinker for many years basically pissing away my entire wage down the pub. Around Christmas 2020 I managed to cut down significantly and was getting in shape and quitting smoking. However it is gotten worse since the pubs reopened. As I am naturally shy alcohol opens me up and drowns sorrows. I have been getting plastered and end up messaging people on Facebook most times it is benign but other times it is been very bad and I have made a prick of myself been too drunk to know what I was doing but because I am used to messaging drunk my messages are legible if bizarre. I have lost friends and been borderline traumatised by what I have done..I am very romantically lonely I am used to picking up after a beer but this is not very frequent. Sometimes women have messaged me on FB for a hookup but it is few and far between. One relationship I did want to work out was with a coworker but it was very strange she seemed to lead me and a few other coworkers on and now she is in a relationship with another woman. I am still upset about that it did not work out I was under the impression she preferred women and I have not got a problem with that but I am sad it did not work out as I really cared for her.I seem to suffer an anxiety disorder and possibly on the autistic spectrum but that is never been formally diagnosed. Might be a personality disorder but I do not know.As a key worker I have been working the entire pandemic as its too cramped in the house I have been working in the office as it gets me out around people and gives me a routine. The office is now very quiet as most people are content to work from home and have no urgency to return whilst they are permitted to work from home. The work is either very dull or needlessly complex standard bureaucracy.Now things could be a lot worse and I am aware of that I have a job and a place to sleep. And I am not saying it is anyone else's fault as I have been very unambitious my whole life. But I just feel completely lost life going nowhere and like I am in purgatory. The old adage I hear when I mention I am stuck is only you can change things which is true but I just do not know what to do.I have no idea what to do at all. I just want to escape and start all over again but society is feeling very dystopian at the moment to me with this pandemic.Thank you for taking the time to read this. 30M life going nowhere lost and feeling hopeless,Depression
39622,think about it i cant do a single thing anymore and the fact that i just suck at everything is just totally fantastic sarcasm i just keep bottling up everything and everything i thought about running away and dieing alone but i don t know how brutal that is,Depression
19299,I was speaking to my therapist today and we came to the realization that I determine my self worth almost exclusively through how others value me rather than how I value myself. It felt like a punch to the gut because while I half heartedly told myself I was worth something in the past I never realized that I was lying to myself and deep down I did not believe my own words. It was truly awful to see the unvarnished truth about myself revealed and I am at a very low point. Id just like to know if anyone else can relate and if so how you got through it because I do not even know where to start Struggling with self worth issues,Depression

13225,Over 12 years ago I M had bad anxiety with random panic attacks. Depression was mixed in there as well probably due to the anxiety they went hand in hand. I went to therapy and a psychiatrist. I was put on lexapro and the panc attacks stopped. I have since moved far away from those doctors have not been to therapy in years. I just kept taking lexapro from my primary because why not. No one ever said to stop. But in the past year or two my concentration has been getting worse and I felt other random little physical side effects from the medicine had just become annoying and thought why not stop lexapro it is been years. I had to stop taking it before at one point due to moving and finding new doctor so I knew about withdrawals and I had to stop another couole prescriptions before lexapro was the one. I slowly lowered my dose every week or two for about a month or so. Eventually I stopped and of course physical withdrawals came on brain zaps and all. I stopped 4 weeks ago and the zaps stopped about a week ago. I have been less tired in the mornings which was a big struggle on lexapro always tired. I have been overall feeling myself. But I am still having some mental things. I am still finding myself having random moments of depression. Just feeling hopelessness and thinking about the things I enjoy as a waste of time. I try to just work through it and tell myself it is temporary thinking it could be the medication adjustment. The other weird thing is since I stopped the lexapro I have had odd sexual side effects. Like decreased sensation weaker orgasm not lasting as long etc. I have never had this on lexapro only one I stopped completely. This is starting to bother me and I am thinking there is some permanent problem from 10 years of lexapro.My main thing is what do I do now? Is this still normal adjustments from coming off lexapro or an SSRI in general? I am not having panic attacks or bad anxiety which is why I took it years ago in the first place. Do I talk to a primary first? Should I try therapy? Go back on medication? Or go to a psychiatrist first? The problem is I have really crap insurance that only covers psychiatry and therapy through MD Live and I see mixed reviews on that so I keep getting put off from trying it. Also not sure if a therapist or psyciatrist is who I should talk to about this.Maybe someone out here went through something similar. I feel like I started with anxiety years ago and ended up with new problems and depression. Not sure what to do next,Depression
9568,I am 26 and I always feel I was born in the wrong generation. Not because of hurr they had better music back then or any stupid reason like that. I should have been born 18 years before some great war so I could join the front line as soon as it started and die in combat. Anything past the age of 12 was just me racking up regrets to burden me further down the line.This life is just not for me. No way any person is supposed to live out his days like this finding comfort only in cigarettes alcohol drugs and trashy reality tv. Even a simple decision like what song should I listen to is overwhelming. People saying get a new hobby or go traveling bro makes me want to throw up. I cannot even watch a new TV show without feeling as if I am drowning in some unfamiliar swamp. it is this minimal routine that keeps me afloat. Any deviation and I am in deep uncharted water with boots made from cement.Medication did absolutely nothing for me therapy is one a hour a week I go to bitch about stuff for 100hr. No real friends that give a shit no skills to get me anywhere else. I only have my mother and she is no help either constantly expecting me to make her happy with an education or grandchildren or comparing to the more successful children of her coworkers.Having a personality and self esteem of a piss soaked rag does not help either. I will ruin and run away from anything good because I simply do not deserve it or it is too hard.Fuck life and fuck living another day. Thanks mom and dad for not using fucking protection you dusty fucking dipshits So this is life? Feeling like I am being mentally waterboarded? Latching onto anything that will distract me from the fact that I exist? Choking back tears from the crippling loneliness? Dreading every single day? Yeah sign me up homie,Depression
16522,I do not know if I want to live anymore. I just feel so shit. It comes and goes but I honestly do not think the good time are worth the bad. I just want nothing.,Depression
17840,I help out whenever my disabled family member needs help and I am totally ok with it. I get that. What I did not sign up for however is being the emotional punching bag that absorbs all of their anger towards themselves deflected on me. It gets tiring and quite frankly just makes me want to drop dead even more than ever. like most times i wish it would just be me getting all the physical pain and dying from it. morbid and clich maybe but I would happily take it over slowly dying on the inside and just hating myself even more in the process. pitfalls of being a caregiver,Depression
47850,I've been in a state of derealization for 4 years I haven't felt like any thing in my life has been real since a very difficult thing and year of absolute he'll in my life. Everything moves fast and I only feel seconds of gratification. I almost never know what's going on anymore my brain feels like a jumbled mess of thoughts wants needs. I don't know who I am anymore because I act out in unpredictable ways. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and have been taking my medication but I absolutely feel nothing except immense sadness or pain. I can't really make meaningful changes in my behavior because any sort of order makes me uncomfortable and anxious so I return back to this chaotic state. Things move to quickly and I feel like I'm swimming within my body. This has been going on for 4 years and all my medical health professionals are aware of this and are unsure how to treat it.Anyone else feel the same way?,Depression

17661,Recently I realized my depression stems from life being a neverending cycle of having to... always do things. The laundry is never permanently done. Every time I wash my hair and get it nicely styled I will have to wash it and try to get it looking nice again. And again. And again. Every time I finish a project for work there will be another one. I always have to eat would not it be great if I did not need to? Either I forget to eat do not have the energy to eat or I eat too much. Every time I lose weight I gain it again and I will have to work super hard to lose it again. Every time my face clears up my period comes around and I get another breakout again and then spend too much money on makeup to cover it up which also does not help my skin. I excelled in school but I was always in this mindset of I just need to get through this and everything will be great. Fill the blank in with whatever you would likesemester project shift day hour diet. I was only ever powering through things then and slowly I got worse and worse at doing that and started missing deadlines and not taking care of myself going to bed without brushing my teeth skipping showering because I was running late and feeling gross all day etc. I chalked it up to Senioritis. Oh I am just a bit burnt out I will gain my productivity back after I have a bit of a break. However that Senioritis has NOT gone away and now I am out of school constantly sending So sorry I am behind on this... emails because I cannot keep up with work at all. I selfimpose deadlines only to miss them. I have others put deadlines on me only to not hit them. And it is not because I am busy. I am not. I graduated with my MA in December and I cannot seem to land a full time gig with it or even get a chance to interview anywhere. I am not qualified enough for a lot of jobs I am like half qualified and that makes me terrified to apply for fear of looking stupid orwhat if I get the job and then I do a bad job and destroy future career prospects? Currently I am freelancing and doing part time work but I am not making enough to move out of my parents house and that only makes doing the work I am doing now feel all the more useless and makes me procrastinate even more. I am letting people down. That used to be the worst case scenario for me but now I seem to have moved past that into full apathy. I am just letting my professional self that I worked so hard to build in school fall apart entirely because I cannot find the will to do more than drag myself out of bed at like noon I work remotely and force myself to eat something. Just responding to a simple email is the biggest win I have had in months and whenever I do manage to force myself to finish something I feel like death aftersucked of all energy and life with a raging headache. God life is just so exhausting and there is no excuse for it other than I do not want to go on and do not have the energy to do so. I think I may be a bit suicidal is the scariest thing I have said aloud to my mom and I think I freaked her out. I am only 24 and I wish my life was over despite everything being amazing on paper up until this point. What has happened to me? It used to feel like there was a light at the end of the tunnel but now I think it is just a never ending tunnel. There is no end. Just death. But at the same time I have so much I want to achieve and see and do. My creativity is actually something I think I have managed to gain back after years of school punching that out of me but you do not get paid for being able to doodle or write the occasional story. I do think that my small personal projects with no deadlines and no eyes on them but mine are the only thing keeping me going right now but even THAT feels like work half the time. I say I love writing but that is not true. I love having written. I do not like the doing just the have done feeling where I get the satisfaction of completing the thing and it being good. But is it even worth the work for that rush? I do not even know what to think anymore. I am just done. 2021 is half way over and I have done nothing with it. I started the year off in a bad place and it has gotten only worse not better. No progress whatsoever. Life is just doing things,Depression
18460,I can' t do this anymore... I want to finish it all but I have no guts to kill myself. How do you guys handle all this shit?? How do you guys handle this shit?,Depression

7262,Hi I am 17 years old and for the past year or two I have been going through this cycle with jobs and consistency. I always want to change for the better and help out my mom and start caring for myself more and more so i eat good for a day a week start to develop my hygiene again run daily and then ill just stop. i cannot stay consistent with it at all. even with things i enjoy like video games music i cannot stay consistent with producing content on these things. But my number one problem is work. I cannot help my mom because of my mental health and it feels so damn disabling. Its been about 7 jobs where ill go through this whole process go the first day or maybe not even show up to the interview and never go back. Why? I do not know I feel afraid socially and the thoughts of the 8 hours of work drains me back to back days on top of it. But I do not understand why I cannot be like other people and just go and get it over with. I cannot do that it feels like I would rather die before go in again and that is how I feel right now 12 hours before my second ever shift at a new job. I thought things would be different this time as I did every other time but I was wrong. Please someone help me out her Its happening again,Depression
24923,my life. has been. the worst. in the past 2 years I have been r4ped had an abortion with a catholic family been shot at directly with a gun by my frienda man tried to abduct meput me in his truck my sister went into a coma for 2 months and was clinically dead for a few minutes been physically abused in everyway by my boyfriend figured out I have a seizure condition that will kill me within 10 years or lesswow. a whole paragraph. When I think of the past 2 years and I go through the things ill be sad then remember something random like having an abortion or being raped. The fact something so unbelievable traumatic is forgettable compared to everything else... just wow.what is wrong with me. why am. why is my luck like this. Its not like these things are all done from one person. everything was a separate group of people or in different parts of my country. The kidnapping thing happened a few days ago when I finally got the courage to work outgo on a run outside and not be scared of people. that was the second day I did that in years. and a man tried to kidnap me.something in my life is not right. something is off. I feel like I am being a human guinea pig been tested to see how far a human can be pushed.I want to go crazy. I just do not want to be in control anymore. I am tired. I want someone to take over my body so I do not need to anymore. I GIVE UP. I GIVE UP WITH THIS. I do not WANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE. I have been suicidaldepressed ever since I can remember. At a certain point I do not care about hurting my family I just need to put that empathy aside for once and care for myself. If this is all a game I quit whoever is doing this to me YOU WIN. WHAT CAN I DO. PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT TO DO I do not want to be alive but I do not want to hurt my family,Depression
16585,okay..so you either burn in hell because you do not seem to follow a certain religion which is probably the right one..or...atheists are right and ur just going to stay in a grave alone forever ..the only other alternative is my life which sucks also ahh ..death,Depression
10278,My whole life has been meaningless. Everyday I wonder and tell god why why am I here? What did I do to get all of these problems? Why am I fat? Why am I ugly? Why am I sad? Why am I angry? What is my life? I do not know what happened to me I used to be a happy healthy person when I was younger. But then as I got older things went downhill from there. did not get many friends in middle school. Got bullied many times and made fun of. Middle school was definitely one of the worst in my lifetime. My family made even worse on me. Mom Dad Brother almost everybody. Got called a fatty by my father and mother many times. Got called a fat cow by my brother. Got called a fucking idiot by my parents. Yeah that is cool. But what do they do to my brother? Nothing. Literally nothing. Hes my opposite of what I am. I am his shadow. Sometimes I feel like I am drowning in my own tears and my hurts every time I try to breathe. I even feel like my tias and tios like my brother and my other cousins more than me. I am just a piece of garbage left out on the counter. Everyday I wake up disappointed knowing I am going to have to live and see the same faces and words. Do I have depression? Idk at this point. Just kind of want peace and let the suffering stop. Just want to see my grandpa. I miss him so much. I do not think I am okay,Depression
23939,there is so much that has happened and that is happening now and I am so scared. I am so tired of not feeling okay of things not being okay but I have got no one to ask for help. I have got to rely on strangers more than I can my own family. it is like once they were gone I was cast aside and I should have seen it coming but it does not make it hurt any less. I am tired.,Depression
47104,Could really use someone to talk to. Im falling apart Never in a million years did I think Id be on Reddit writing something like this but maybe this is my soul trying to find some sort of salvation from the pain. Ive been thrown into the proverbial fire as of late amp I feel like Im just unable to get a grip on anything. My father passed away amp I hadnt spoken to him in well over 10yrs prior to his passing. He was extremely abusive to me as a child to the point or making me bleed. I am not really sad about his passing but feel many of the what if things in relation to a better childhood.I found out that my sister is not 100 my sister amp we dont have the same father amp we both have been lied to about that our entire lives by our mother who I also dont have the best relationship with. We did DNA tests two days ago for absolute concrete evidence of everything so now its a waiting game. I live in the same house as her amp have been dying to get out on my own but financially am unable to at the moment due to my own disability cystic fibrosis.The girl I have been in a situationship doesnt feel the same way I do about her. This one hurts me so much honestly more in a sense than my dad passing. I feel like Im mourning the loss of someone still alive but we are still friends amp love one another. I never thought Id catch feelings for her but here we are. We have a beautiful friendship the sex is great amp we have so many great laughs amp moments. Shes been such a bright spot in my dark times lately. I wanted to see if we could give things a real try but she just doesnt feel how I do. This now is breaking my heart amp dont know how to navigate it. I dont want to just get rid of her as a friend I genuinely care about her. She is fine with continuing what we are doing but Im not sure I can do that right now with how I feel about her. Everything is just compounding ontop of eachother amp I feel like Im suffocating. My appetite is shot I feel restless where I feel like Im going crazy amp Ive been having very dark thoughts amp find humor in self harm jokes to myself amp my close friends. Maybe this is a cry for help maybe Im trying. Im not sure. But if anyone reads this amp has advice or a heart to be here for me I would love amp cherish your kindness. Thank you .,Depression
47833,I cant stop crying tonight. Its both cathartic and kind of annoying. Theres really not a tangible reason for it. Im not upset about any one thing. Its more just a general feeling of frustration at myself I guess. It doesnt help that my stomach was bothering me all night even after I took the medicine that usually helps that. I dont know. Its just annoying.,Depression
37703,i ve posted here many time under many different name my cat is dying a of the moment and i can t do anything about it i wish i could take him to a vet but i don t have the capacity to take him there my internship is starting next week and i won t have any money until i receive my first pay check next month it s so hard to see him suffer he s the only one that tether me to this world i wish i could die with him he took me out of depression and i can t do anything for him in return he s the only reason why i continue to fight i continue to feed and make him drink with a syringe he hate it when others do it but he trust me his life i wish i could tell him i m sorry that couldn t do anything i love you i ll have my final interview in an hour i know it s selfish for me to say i wish i get through it when he s the one dying i don t know where else to share it,Depression

24552,I am so fucking tired of being depressed. I have been depressed my whole life. My childhood was rough I always had weight problems no friends etc. I think I am the most hideous person on Earth. I used to hate my self so much.I have never had a job I enjoyed. I always dreaded going to these shitty ass jobs. I bust my ass off for them people tell me I am smart and good at my job but what is the point? there is no promotion no raise. I am stressing myself out working myself to the point of exhaustion for NO REASON. none of this matters it is all so stupid.I felt a glimpse of happiness last year when I got into my first relationship. I gave it my all. I made sacrifices for this person and they broke my heart. Cheated on me. Bullied me. I broke up with them but I still love and miss them so much. I do not see myself being in a relationship anytime soon. Sometimes i feel I will never be as happy as I was last year. Ever again.I am so tired of trying. But at the same time I am tired of being depressed. Its so not fair to end my life and kill myself and let all this bullshit win. Life is too fucking short to live like this all miserable. I am so tired of caring. I am so tired of trying to people please 247. Tired of these pointless jobs. I just do not care anymore.I am doing what makes me happy from now on. Imnot fucking busting my ass for this job anymore. While my coworkers are lazy and STILL GET PAID THE SAME AS ME LOL I want to be selfish for once in my life. I want to be happy and I do not fucking care who or what gets in my way I am going to do what I want. I refuse to let all this crap end me. there is so much pressure on us to be perfect. Have the perfect body and face have a partner have money the perfect job. Omg fuck that its sooo stupid. Why do we even have to be those things.I had those things. I had the job the boyfriend had lost weight and I was still fucking miserable. Because I thought i had to follow other peoples idea of perfect and happy. To be happy. But it is such a lie. My idea of happy is different and I am going to find it. We are worth way too much to kill ourselves and lose to depression. Atleast I know i am. I am tired of fighting depression and distracting myself and hiding it from it. Imgoing to beat it bc i cannot do this anymore. I am done..,Depression

Had to block the number to stop getting notifications asking me if I accepted the terms and conditions and wanted to be connected to a counselor. Go America.I guess I just want to go on record that I am begging for fucking help just for someone to fucking care I tried at least a dozen times over to engage with the AI interface to get an actual human being.... fucking shit. Fuck everything.,Depression

26091,I have been for few years feeling sadder and worst. It started when I realised who am I. I was trying to stay positive and funny for my friends and classmates. But when I am alone there in no escape from my thoughts. What I did wrong how I did it ect. For understanding next part I am student of electrical engineering since I was little everybody was telling me how smart I am but I do not feel like it. Even now when someone ask me to do something I can say no so I will take it. But I cannot push myself to do it or if it is half way done I cannot finish it. Studying is hard for my because I am loosing focuse. So in the end everyone is angry on me that I did not do. Even worse my GF broke up with me and few days after she was with somebody else back then I was trying to look as nice as nice as I could and threatening her like a queen. I did not argue when she block all my friends on my phone telling them I did not want to see them. That pulled me down a lot. Every day I am sitting on the computer and watching blank screen. I just cannot push my self to do something. Me and my friends were smoking weed year ago that was only time when my mind was empty. But there were some side effects and my mum. Few mouths ago I tried killing myself with high electricity but I ended up in in agony of pain and fell down and that saved me. So now I do not know what to do and how to plan my future if I should just try killing myself on an accident once again so my family would not think that I had depression or ony mental disorder.

26603,I am an animal lover and I will often have these moments where a video or article or something I see in person will remind me that animals are literally always suffering horrifically somewhere. Whether wild or pets there is always an animal injured dying lost scared sick hungry abused alone....somewhere out there. I know Mother Nature is harsh but it still hurts to see. Even worse when the suffering is caused by humans. To know there will always be so many animals out there suffering at any given time is suffocating. Are other animal lovers able to cope better? How do animal lovers with depression not get constantly suffocated by knowing there is always an animal suffering somewhere?,Depression

24018,Not here for advice just a thought that I am continuing to struggle with. Trigger Warning If its too much for some people please do not read on. Anyone does not get scared of death? Death does not scared me one bit. I find it silly when people are scared of death. I want to die if I get my way but I know I cannot because I know my family would be devastated and they are the reason I have to stay alive. Its a struggle for me every day to live when I really believe that death is freedom. Death free you from the burden of life. You wake up work sleep eat and you do it again the next day. Time passes by and you will be old and on your death bed. I had existential crisis in my early 20s to mid 20s. Asking myself those questions likewhat is the purpose in life? I still do not have the answers for it and I know I will never know. So combining the not fear of death with no purpose in life I feel death is liberating. I am an intuitive person so I feel everything and everyone. I feel their struggles and desires. Death to me means free from nasty people free from the struggles of mundane tasks free from financial struggles and free from responsibility in daily life. The physical pain of death scared me more than death itself. The knowledge that my family will be devastated scared me than death. You know when people say I beat death so I survived and I am a stronger person after I beat death. I do not even relate to that. Its always bedazzled me when people find that surviving death makes you strong. I am constantly struggling with seeing how being alive benefits me. Here are the list of things people would normally give Experience in LoveMarriage most marriages do not last and even if they do there are problems with cheating or something else that comes with it. Career I do not care what title you have you are working to live and to survive in this world not really enjoying itHobbies people are always struggles with finding time to actually enjoy their hobbies.Open to hear other thoughts but I am really just venting my frustration with living when death sounds more free to me When death does not scared you its difficult to live when life is a constant chore to live,Depression
13667,A little bit about me I am 16 m have family and friends who care about me and have actively tried to see it through about helping me with mental health. The problem? I do not use it. I cannot get myself to do it. Everyday I sleep less and less get angrier and angrier. Recently I have noticed something about myself as much as I hate the thought of suicide it still comes back to me. Like to haunt me or just get me to do it. In my closet there is a rope for you know what and 350 stuffed away in case I want to just run away. Is that weird? Is it weird that I find comfort in knowing that 6 feet to my left is a way to end it all or to try and get a fresh start? I do not hate my life but at the same time I do.Late 2020 early 2021 has been the lowest point in my life and as much as I want to say that I have gotten over it all it just simply is not true. Feels more like kicking the can. I guess what I am trying to say is that I have dug a hole so deep that there is only two options kill myself or run away. I have been getting worse over the past month...,Depression

25333,I dropped out of college in 2014 following a suicide attempt after dealing with domestic violence at home and in my relationship being broke and without a real home and losing my sense of identity to everything I was trying to be for everyone else. Since then I have done counseling I take my meds I climbed the career ladder at my job and can provide for myself I feel 100 sure of who I am and I would never been better. However to elevate my career to where I want it I need to get my BA with a Graphic Design focus. I am getting registered with my top pick university I have support and I am on the right track. However all of my confidence in myself and my work has flown out the window. I feel like an imposter like I was not meant to have this and like I am destined to fail. I can feel depression creeping in I never feel like doing anything except gaming anymore and I freeze whenever I have to do anything adulty. Some people make this higher education gig look easy and here I am 30 years old freaking out about it. I guess I just really need some support and a sense of community this is my first time posting here...so scary. And any advice would be appreciated as well. Everything's falling into place for me and it is making me feel worse???,Depression

15162,I am about to graduate nursing school and I just know in my heart I have made a huge mistake and it is not for me. I have just wasted years of my life and I am so mad at myself for going through all of this. I really do not know what I want in life and I am 35! I was raised in a high control religion so I was raised suppressing my own desires and wants. Both of my parents committed suicide my mother when I was 19 and my father when I was 25 and I have just been trying to cope. I thought this career might help but I have gone into it for the wrong reasons and I just have too much anxiety to even see myself continuing. I got out of the religion about 3 years ago just as I was entering nursing school and now I have been cut off from basically all of the friends and family I had. I am just a huge failure and a waste. I have wasted my life,Depression
25764,The title says it all. I am 23 years old coming up on 4 years sober in a month but yet I feel hopeless. My first 2.5 years of recovery were awesome. I lived in a recovery house had a great network went to meetings all the time. Everything was great.The last year and a half on the other hand have not been so pleasant. I moved out of my recovery home and moved back home to go to school. I have not established any sort of network back home I have just been putting all my time and effort into school and work and now I just have nobody. I cut everyone off at home since I used with them and they were no good to be around so now I go to school go to work and then sit by myself. I feel hopeless. I fell back into old ways and started betting on sports constantly because I justify that by saying its not using any sort of drugs but really its just filling it with another addiction.Everyone my age is out partying and having fun but not me. I am jealous of those people at times and the same time I am not. I just do not know where I fit in what to do or what I am doing at this point. Again like the title says I feel hopeless. If you read all of this thank you for reading my shitty vent. Feel hopeless and alone,Depression

25214,I have been going through a lot of depression lately. I just graduated cannot find a job ended up hating my degree so decided to pursue another degree. the college is not letting me be a full time student this fall so I am trying to get a job but I feel worthless I am getting rejections I waste all my day. I have no energy to do anything. My body hurts I have no energy to get out of the house or even get out of bed. I only have like one friend who wants to see me but I have no energy to face anyone and I keep on telling him that I am busy and have something to do. I live with my grandparents and they do not know what I am going through. They expect me to be happy but I cannot. I feel like my life is useless and I do not deserve to live. Just like my sister committed suicide I feel like I should too because I am useless. Hate my degree do not want to be dependent but at the same time I want to pursue a second degree and work as well. I am in such a tough spot right now. I really just do not want to live. What was the point? I have struggled all my life. First had a traumatic childhood my mom cheated on my dad then my dad passed away my mom abandoned us and then my sister committed suicide. I struggled my way through college dealing with grief and bipolar which lead me to be absolutely being lost in college my whole 4 years. Figuring out what I want to do and then graduated in a degree I hate. There is just no point of doing anything. I keep pushing everyone away and complain about being lonely,Depression

48272,I wish I hadn't been born help I mean it's as simple as that.I'm tired of living like this. Tired of living in general and everything it involves interpersonal relationships people politics economy thinking expectatives. All that crap makes me feel like shit and I wish I could turn it all off. However I don't want to die. That would hurt the people around me. That would hurt my mom. And my little sister. And unlike other situations I wouldn't be here to at least try to fix it. They'd be left with the same nothingness that I feel but worse cuz ofc death of a loved one is worse than just my own personal regrets. So I just wish I hadn't been born. That my mom had had a miscarriage that would've hurt yeah but not for long or that I'd never been conceived or something. I wish I was a blank space in the Universe. Something that had never existed. A hole or something like that.They say energy can't be destructed and I wish it wasn't like that. I wish I could just disappear completely from existence and leave no trace I wish people would just forget everything about me so I could die without it being a sin. Is there a way to stop feeling like this? Cuz the only way to stop existing is dying and I've already said why I don't want to kms exactly. Is there a way to avoid it? Can it get better?,Depression

I cant plan anything in my life or build any pathway I live day to day like an animal. I just hate what a pathetic and disjointed life I live. No path or career. No family. No education.

17697,Solitude The state of being alone. The last few months I have experienced solitude. I lay in my room 247 and the only time I go out in to the world is to practice with my bands. I have a mix of emotions about the way I interact with people. Sometimes I can meet new people and not be scared nervous or afraid. But most of the time I am to much of a coward to go out and meet new people. Which probably explains why I have been single my whole life. Though I am just 17 I frequently have suicidal thoughts. I used to act on those thoughts and hurt myself bad. Sure back when I was 13 I went through an emo phase and hurt myself for attention. But this is different. Nowadays I really want to die and sometimes I always pick a date to end myself but I am not going to because I would hurt lots of people who care for me. I love everyone too much to end myself sorry if this was concerning I just really needed to get this off my chest. My experience with being lonely,Depression

I fell for more bullshit today which means I am still an easy mark for his cons which makes me paranoid about starting another business. He told me crazy shit about the man I am in love with and everyone wants it to my fault. I lost my job because I fell in love with my boss and he has a girlfriend who continues to make my life a living Hell. This woman has ruined my life medically financially emotionally and worse. I have an ex who filmed me giving her a blowjob to hurt me and the man I am in love with. She convinced my dad to financially cut me off and worse. She told my coworkers that I am schizophrenic and worse. She may or may not be responsible for 2 cars being totaled. She cyberstalks me and prevents me from getting work done. I have another ex who wants everything I do to be about some symbolic bullshit that means I still love him which has also made my life a living Hell. My friends think I want to fuck their boyfriends because I fell in love with my boss who has a girlfriend and she is now convinced them that I love all their boyfriends. Embarrassing moments of my life have been publicized including pimple popping showering masterbating etc. I just do not want to be made fun of for it. The man I am in love with would not care if I died. I do not know how much of my life is a lie. I do not know if I buried my cat alive because of these people. I get reminded every day that exes master ate to me and do not want me to be happy. I get blamed for all of it and its cruel. I do not want to participate in this life,Depression

17354,You know I try not to put my own symptoms above anyone else's. But it is a hard point to argue. I have lost more than most people ever will and I do not say that to spite people nor say their pain is less than mine.ampx200BI could write a book about the crap I have been through I have actually. Not officially published but I have written a book. ampx200BMore to the point it makes me wonder why. Why was I put here? Why this body? Why this life? What in the FUCK did I do in my past life or whatever to deserve this? Seriously I want to know. Was I like Hitler or something?ampx200BYou may ask yourself he cannot be that bad right? And you would be wrong.ampx200BI will give you a brief overview immediate victim of favoritism within the first 3 years of life. I mean BLATANT favoritism parents divorced within those 3 years. parents stole me from each other back and forth until Social Services stepped in first foster home gave me a short glimpse of what it was like to be cared for in the first time of my 8 years of life ended up being taken out of that home after about 6 months and put into a new one new foster mother beats me regularly sexually abused me frequently and to top it off keeps me locked up in a basement room with no windows no clocks no way to tell time. Leaving me in there for days at a time. This was frequently done over a 5 year period of my life after 5 years had passed my father got custody of me only to treat me like a ghost. He only got me back for the SSI check. Other than that I did not exist to him pretty much in school I was teased a lot because I was constantly in sweats I did not have any real clothing other than that and laundry was not done on any regular basis. Their laundry was mine was not. already extremely socially isolated things progressively got worse up to the point of someone physically bullying me and eventually I snapped and put him in the hospital. Made me realize what a monster I was. during the last couple years of high school I found my high school sweetheart. We were together for 7 years. We made a son together. he is currently 17 turning 18 later this year. social services got involved in my life again claiming we had failed to get our son his shots which we had to reschedule because her grandmother had passed on the day before the scheduled shots. So there goes a year and a half of fighting the incessant demands of social services they get into her head. Tell her she does not need me. She leaves me takes me to court for 100 custody. At that point I did not think I could possibly be more broken. I did not have a choice so I just gave up and within 2 months she had taken my son to another state to pursue some internet boyfriend she met on some backwards art site D something or another. a couple years pass and I decide to try again with someone new. Started off strong but there were a ton of issues and a lot of damage left behind from my past relationship. I could never trust her. still she got pregnant on our second time so she had not gotten a chance to see the extent of the damage in me. I wish I could have been able to tell her to just run run away from me. I suppose in some way I did just not in so many words. towards the end our son was delivered as a stillborn. His umbilical cord had wrapped around his neck killing him days before he was due. Just a few days. we split ways after this. I took the loss personally as though it was God's way of punishing me for being the monster I was. Got super suicidal and tried dozens of times to end myself. All failed obviously. a few more years passed after and I was still stuck on this notion that I wanted a family. So naturally I found a new relationship and moved clear across the country just to be with her. while we were in person together things were amazing. It was like gravity we could not stay away from each other. But when the time came to part ways... that is when things got ugly fast. still we managed to make it last for nearly 5 years and she bore me another son. I wanted to be there so badly and she knew I did. We had talked about several times. I got to see my son ONCE before she decided she was going to keep him from me. Even despite the fact she knew I was going to be a good father. First her it was just easier to not have to fight her grandparents who she lived with. So that is what she did. He was born nearly 7 years ago and I have not seen him since the day he was born. after two years of fighting with her to just be a family with me I finally broke in the worst way I have ever broken in my life. I just gave up. She was not going to change her mind ever. So I walked away. more suicide attempts and a few months later I decided a drastic change was needed inside me. So that is what I did. I pursued self actualization and personal development and started to try to deal with all thus trauma I had experienced in this life. something clicked inside like a burner just turned on and suddenly I started thinking differently I became different than who I was before. The original owner of this vessel was gone and I was born. I was ready to accept that I would never have my own family but I was not ready to give up on love so I went and found a new relationship. This one was actually pretty good. I did not accuse her of cheating ever in our entire relationship. I gave her room to do her own stuff and encouraged her to take time with her son her friends her family. I was being a good partner for once in my life and I was open to her open to the idea this could last it honestly felt like it was my forever home. I let myself actually believe in that. as you may suspect things eventually fell apart. She pulled away from me stopped so much as even touching me and I tried to talk with her communicate what was going on to no avail. The day we broke up she had gone away for 5 days saying she was babysitting her sisterinlaw's dog. Well I found out that that whole story was a lie just from a Facebook post of her sisterinlaw at home with her two children getting ready for the weekend. in the end she said it was because I was too sensitive and too difficult to love. Those words still stick with me almost 2 years later now. at this point I am completely lost about what I want anymore. I want to have that relationship that lasts but I am not sure I can trust myself to actually even try again. So what else is there for me? I could never have my family cannot even have a secure relationship even when I have worked so hard to be acceptable and lovable. I cannot help but feel like I am just wasting time wasting my therapist's time all in some delusion that I will ever be worthy of love.ampx200Bthat is just a chunk of my iceberg. The super short short version. I suppose that is why it is so hard for me to believe that anyone could even comprehend the things I have been through. The bottom is not where you think it is. There are places in the mind much darker much deeper than you may ever know. End all Be all,Depression

24337,my mom is not a bad mom. she is actually like my best friend in a lot of ways ...that is probably more so because I am a fucking loner but anyways... but sometimes she really struggles with being empathetic. like really. whenever I am home and I am inevitably depressed because my brain sucks and being home sucks and just everything fucking sucks she would sooner lecture me about the importance of staying active and utilizing my free time and shit before providing actual emotional support. or like validating my feelings. not even a simple I am sorry you are going through this.she takes it personally. when i do not feel like going out for a walk with her and the dog. when i do not want to come out of my room. when i do not want to go anywhere. she tells me what i should be doing how this is bad for my health what I am doing wrong. as if i do not understand that laying in my bed all day except to get food is not exactly a great way to live or stay healthy. as if I am oblivious despite sitting here all day alone with my thoughts. if anything my depression makes me hyperaware of my issues.over the years i feel like I have explained myself over and over again. and yet it never sticks. because it is always the same fucking lecture. your body is literally going to deteriorate if you do not move. your wasting your youth the years when you have the most energy time and do not have to worry about bills. sitting is the new smoking.god. please leave me alone if you do not want to actually give me support. because otherwise you are making it worse. the worst part is that she does not understand how her lectures are not helpful. she just sees her good intentions and me not responding well to them. so then she thinks I am just not trying hard enough or do not care enough or whatever. even though when I am at my place at school I am super lonely and isolated i at least can breathe just a little more. I am so tired. vent non empathetic mom,Depression

47399,Alcohol is the only thing I look forward to I can only drink on Fridays which is tomorrow and I cant wait even tho alot of the time I have a panic attack or start crying while drunk lying on the floor crying and puking in the toilet and not being able to think is so much better than this life,Depression
18534,I am lost and do not know what to do or how to thinkGo back one month me and my girlfriend its an online relationship break up she left me because of just dumb arguments and stupid shitSo I am single at this point and I feel like I enjoy being single I talked to another girl to spite the girl who dumped me and it felt good I liked it. Then the next morning she texts me and is super sorry and wants to date again and regrets it all I feel terrible that she is hurting like that and I instantly jump back in then I start getting thoughts like what if I do not want to date anymore? Like intrusive thoughts.This gave me the biggest panicanxiety ever that I have had since that day so now we go back 2 weeks ago my anxiety is so bad and I keep telling myself with intrusive thoughts I do not want to date so I left her this time and I instantly regretted it so hard I got really fucked up emotionally I begged for her back this time she said she liked being single and stuff but would try again.Since then I got into therapy I tried improving myself for the relationship I paid all the money I had for online therapy I got into IRL therapy I just had my session today and what we talked about was how much I love this girl and how to deal with intrusive thoughts.Now here we are 15 minutes ago she leaves me again this time its final now I am just nothing I am just laying here crying empty I do not know what to do or what to think I am just lost scared and fucking sad. Not sure what to do or think anymore,Depression
26990,Back then when I dreamed myself achieving something like doing great on a competition or just a simple exam I used to see my face. But now that persons face is different mostly someone else that I know. is not it fucking pathetic. My own brain does not belive in me and puts someone else's face. I just cannot stand the fact that the only thing I am doing when I m so fucking down is making me feel more worthless. In the last six months my selfconfidence dropped so much that the person accomplishing something when i dream is not me.,Depression
47874,How can I get out of the loop depression is taking my life away I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for a long time now and eating disorders in the past that have not fully healed.The trigger this time was that I saw a photo my broyfriend took of me and my legs appeared enormous to me. That single thought that arised from a photo that a loved one took on me lead to not eating in three days selfinjuries and an endless loop of feeling like shit. I feel so narcissistic and chidlish why would my looks be at all THIS important? Still now I cannot get over it. Just seeing my legs in a photo that was taken with love. My boyfriend almost threw me out of home cos I was behaving like a fucking idiotic child.Yet it is so hard to get out of the loop I literally have nothing that makes me feel happy and I consider myself to be under the normal for intelligence and I don't have any special skills so I don't see a point in feeling better with myself. I feel so miserable so useless I only bring dark stuff to my lovely boyfriend. It's like I know how to get out of the loop my therapist gave me many tips but still when I am in the middle I cannot get out my mind is racing with destructive shit that I believe and I act according to all these thoughts.The eating disorder has already been on for 13 years and I am already 30. I never imagined at this point of my life I would still be dealing my so many instrusive thoughts and still thinkking this is such a big of an issue. Its like really who is going to notice I put on weight? and if they do why would it be so importnat? there are far many things more importnat than looks but I seem to not be able to get over it anyhow. I feel like I should really die if am not skinny.This post might be destructured as I am a little anxious right nowTLDR I am 30 and still behaving like a baby and thinking my body image issues are the center of the world. I am ruining my relationship because when I get in a depressive mood I cannot get out of it during days and I become aggressive and a total bitch with everyone. I don't want to live like this I want to enjoy my loved ones,Depression

23921,Hi everyone thanks for reading. My boyfriend has been depressed throughout his entire life. Some times are goodsometimes bad. Recently times have been bad as we are nearing graduation and he feels a lot of pressure. Most of this pressure comes from fear of failing time being short not making enough money and him being behind in his computer science career. Hes become pretty hopeless. He is an over thinker. He thinks about life and death a lot and often questions the meaning of life. Idk the answer to anything. He recently finished therapy for his anxiety and that has improved but his depression got worse. I try to be as patient supportive and understanding as I can. I have not really struggled with depression. But I am struggling with my own mental health recently because I am not used to thinking a lot of negative thoughts or things that I cannot answer. I love him and I want to be there for him. But I also want him and me to be happy. I know its not easy and I do not think it ever will be. I am just looking for some advice or encouragement on how to cope and stay strong and understand the right things to say when he asks the big questions or feels downoverwhelmed. Thanks. My 22F Boyfriend 22M of 5 years is depressed.,Depression
25835,TLDR bf is getting more depressed over time. I am trying so hard to get him the help he needs. I am getting pushed away and its affecting my mental health now. I feel like everything is pointing towards us breaking up.we have been dating for about 1.5 years. I have GAD and moderatemild depression. I am currently on medications and in therapy. He has severe depression and anxiety I suspect and has been in therapy before. Hes going back to therapy but there were not any availabilities until August. He has a history of getting depressed in relationships previous two gfs and me.He and I have similar histories. Both our families had pretty nasty divorces. Both of our mothers developed cancer while we were still young teenagers. Our families are in similar geographic regions. We both had a relationship that was emotionally abusive. I guess I mention these because it was easy for us to understand each other when we first met but also because I think these could have impacted our mental developments and relationships.Both my partner and I are in graduate school. He has a major exam coming up that determines if he will qualify for candidacy. This exam has been looming for a while and has been pushed back a couple of times because of COVID but also because he was not prioritizing preparing for it. This stressor is contributing to his depression.The other stressor is our relationship. Its been on the rocks for a couple of months now. He left to visit family in May and he was not in the mood to have sex when he came back. I miss the sexual intimacy but I am much prefer physical affection and emotional intimacy. Having said that its always been hard for him to open up to me. In June he did something that really upset me at the time which started his spiraling. I have since forgiven him but I do not think hes forgiven himself. He admitted hes been depressed for a while now. I did not see the signs very well and attributed it to stress from his exam before I knew our relationship was also stressing him out. He said a lot of selfhate things and started punching himself in the face. I called his dad and told him what is going on because I felt like I could not be his only support. we have been in limbo how he described it since June. We did not see each other much the first couple of weeks because we both needed space. After that I have been the one initiating contact and hanging out to get a feel for things. we have been telling we love and miss each other still. However he told me this weekend that the physical affection is hurting him and he was not comfortable with me going to our mutual friends because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. For 4th of July he also did not act like my boyfriend.This really hurt me but I have been trying to listen to his needs more because of his depression. Hes asked for more space to focus on school which also hurts but I do the same when I need to get work done. I have tried to get him into our schools counseling between now and his regular therapist but he does not want to talk to a new therapist. I have also tried to get him to couples therapy. He said he would go but its obvious he does not want to be there so I have not scheduled anything because I do not think it would be productive if he does not want to be there. I have asked if I can help him around his house because he is not taking care of himself. I have asked how can I support him which was the space mentioned above.He does not know what he wants in regards to us. I do not know if its the depression talking. Hes scared if we have an on and off relationship that I will eventually leave him for good because an ex did that. Hes thinks I am disappointed in him I have never said this he sets these expectations for himself because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. I feel he does love me because 1 friends and his family have told me he loves and cares about me very much 2 he showed it through his actions before all of this 3 he told me he loves making me happy. But my doubts have been creeping in. He said his depression is getting worse. He does not want to see me I feel like I am walking on eggshells because I cannot tell him how this is affecting me without him spiraling and I just feel like I keep hurting him when I am trying my best to help him. I cannot help but think his feelings for me have changed.I love him so much for so many reasons. I loved him early on in our relationship but I wanted to be sure it was real and not infatuation so I did not say anything until maybe 9 months in. I wish he could see what I see. But him pushing me away is hurting me and affecting my mental health now. My anxiety is through the roof and I can feel my depression starting.I am not exactly sure what I am looking for from you guys but thanks for reading if you made it to the end. My boyfriend is pushing me away and I am at a loss,Depression
39032,i ve been in therapy a few month cbt he mostly just advises me to try to stay in the present and mediate at first it seemed to help a little but the larger issue i have won t stop bothering me i make good money and i m not bad looking at all but i have basically zero friend and i haven t been on a date in over 0 year im and i ve been thinking about suicide a lot but i obviously can t tell my therapist or he ll get me emergency petitioned im really not sure what to do my anxiety and depression just seems to keep getting worse i can barely get myself to eat most day let alone exercise or try to talk to someone,Depression
21684,Just venting here I have nowhere else to do so..I have been constantly questioning my relationship over the past couple months and it is leaving me so drained. I can feel the depressive and angry thoughts coming back to me even taking my medication. Half the time I am tired sad and regretful and the other half I am really angry and vengeful. All I want is to start breaking him emotionally just like he is done to me and I know I am getting colder and more distant to everyone everyday. I have not had these thoughts in years. All I want is someone to love me again because I left the perfect relationship a year ago with a loving woman for one that turned into a clusterfxck I cannot escape. I even feel a bit of a spark for her again. I do not know what to do Bad thoughts,Depression
17182,I am so confused.... so I was talking with a friend I do not talk to anymore. he said he was raped and molested for 3 years. we started talking about my trauma... and I kind of realized I have all the symptoms I guess is a way to put it of getting rped... but I do not know...I guess I just find it hard to believe but it is possible...I cannot remember anything before like 8th grade I am going to be a junior this coming school year besides the fact that I had a friend and we had all of our classes together besides like 1 or 2 classes. anyway I am also either hypersexual or completely disgusted with it. and... I keep hearing kinks stem from childhood trauma not sure if that is true or not but I have some pretty hard kinks... for example cnc but... idk I never saw that like I possibly got rped... I just thought that was normal to not remember anything and are sexual in a way...and of course I do not want to say I have been because idk if that is true. I truly do not know so I cannot say anything. I guess it is finally time to talk about this... tw rpe amp slight sex talk,Depression
11501,Making a joke out of pain is all I know how to do but currently the pain is both mental and physical and I do not know how to make it better. My so is emotionally unavailable and I cannot talk to him about this I know not good not the time. Everything hurts and I just want it to stop how do I keep on going right now? Much sad,Depression
18695,I have recently been dealing with severe depression. I often find myself struggling to get things done around the apartment and that includes work. I have these terrible head fog that just will not let me focus like I used to and I push myself to pick up basic tasks.Past week has been especially difficult as I no longer have my gf working from home with me anymore. She has started going back into the office. I appreciate that she is there for me but at the same time I am happy that she gets a break from me now as well. I know its not easy watching someone in this state.I find myself right now reflecting on the person that I used to be just a year ago. I had ambition and generally enjoyed life. I struggle now to feel happiness even with weekly therapy hobbies new and old etc. I have serotonin syndrome and do not react well to medication. I am constantly tired physically and emotionally. Taking all of this day by day but time does not seem to be making things any easier. I do not know what else I can try at this point to be more like the person I used to be and less of a burden to my friends and family. Reflecting on my current depression,Depression
22163,..but all I can think of is how should I kill myself than live this life I wish to feel excited again to probably look forward to something? To fall in love again..,Depression
7002,I cannot fucking feel a single fucking thing man . I bottle up every feeling and I am so far away from everyone in my life . I have no friends or anyone I can talk to I feel like shit right this now I do not want anything in life I do not want to grow old travel make friends or whatever the fuck everyone says we should live for . I just want to end it I wish I died in my sleep everyday I wake up I feel shock and sadness . I did not choose to be born so why do I have to suffer for people who do not give a fuck about me . oh god !! just kill me nowMusic used to make me feel better it was the only thing but now even music does nothing . I cannot tell anyone about how I feel I feel stuck I cannot take this anymore . My parents think that I am very lazy and stupid so anything I tell them would be because I am m lazy . Like I told my mom n dad about how I do not find anything interest while talking about career and they said it is because I am lazy and stupid that I think too highly of myself and that I am overconfident .They also said that I am useless and would not accomplish anything in life . when actually I have low selfesteem and zero selfconfidence . how am I supposed to tell them about my depression that I have got because of neglect and abuse from them in childhood . Like I tell them that I do not feel like doing anything then they would just say it is because I am lazy you do not want to do this then you are fucking lazy and stupid I just want to die in my sleep that is the only thing I want . I feel so alone I wish I had someone to support me emotionally The worst thing about all this is being alone,Depression
19156,I just feel so worn out. I put myself out there I put on a smile like everyone want me to. I rarely do anything for myself. When I do my wife either believes I am being selfish because I disappeared for an hour to do something that makes me feel like myself or is just completely under appreciated. I ask her about her day every day and I could not think of the last time she asked me. Occasionally Ill let out a little kernel of my day and she will agree with me about whatever emotion I am trying to express. But I am just expected to know all of her coworkers and all the drama. Normally I invite a bunch of people over for the 4th and I just did not have the energy to do it. I invited my best friend and his family over. We made the plans a couple of weeks beforehand. And he forgot he had family coming over so I get it and it the plans became out if his control due to his parents. I get that I truly do but no one makes sudden visits from outside the state. So he knew and just forgot we had made plans. I pretty much talked to him everyday but it never came up.I am just so tired of putting myself out there and just being disappointed by everyone around me. And its not like I have any huge expectations I just want to feel as important to them as they are for me. I am sure if I ended everything they would miss me but you miss your socks if you miss placed them as well. The only thing that is keeping me going is my daughter. I grew up without my father heart attack and Id rather not continue the cycle. But how long is that feeling going to last? I feel so thin,Depression
39157,i just doubt and am insecure about everything specifically my emotion a well a my time management and productivity for example i will feel tired then i ll think am i actually tired what doe tired even feel like am i just imagining and making this up i do this with every emotion including happiness and excitement it s ruined how i feel emotion i don t feel any of them anymore because i doubt them so much i just feel numb how can i start feeling emotion normally again and stop doubting them,Depression
47293,Having trouble eating sleeping relaxing. I'm just so lonely and in my head all the time. I'm trying so hard to make friends but idk how. It all makes me angry at society as a whole for leaving me all alone. I've wanted friends my whole life. I haven't had any in 20 years. And all I can wonder is why the fuck nobody wants to be near me or to talk to me or to even ask me questions. I feel like everyone is actively avoiding me at this point. And I hate them for it. I hate living because of everyone.,Depression
25609,I am so in love with the idea of being loved and loving someone. Having someone who is ready to sacrifice their lives for you... you can go home and spend the best hours of your entire day just being in the same place with this special someone. When I get rejected by people I think that love me I get extremely sad and feel heartbroken and betrayed altough rejecting someone is very OK. I dunno why man I am like this... But since the last few years I have been completely alone and the thought of dying alone have always haunted me. What can I do to cope a little?sorry if inappropite subreddit. how to cope with extreme loneliness and constant social rejection if I am a hopeless romantic.,Depression

26229,I am just tired of being alone there is people around but I am not interested in talking with them. I am so lonely all the time. I called for counselling its 3 weeks away and I only get 2 sessions covered. A psychiatrist is busy also and is a couple months waiting. How do you feel happy in life normally? So depressed,Depression

23780,I am 20 college dropout still with parents. No skills talents nothing I can profit off of. I have no interests no passion for anything I have been living on survival mode for the last like 6 or 7 years. By survival I mean no plans for the future only for the day. I did not shower regularly did not brush my teeth regularly and did not give a fuck about anything since I was always inferior to others in every regard. Basically there was and there still is no future for me. I just want a 95 to have my own apartment to then legally change my name number literally everything and I will obviously never be able to get any of that due to being braindead. What now? How do I cope with the permanent inferiority? I will never be anything in life,Depression

25688,Lately I have been trying to improve myself. I have taken up a lot of new stuff tried changing the way I do things. A lot of it is helping and generally I do feel more fulfilled. But I feel like things are starting to crack. When I go out drinking with friends I have these moments where I pour my soul out to someone. Sometimes its great I let them know how much I care about them stuff like that. But sometimes I concern myself when I think back to other moments. I basically begged a friend to live his best possible life. I am just afraid that I am starting to push people away without realizing it. I was always in the good will come to me eventually mindset. But lately I have wanted to take a more active role in my life. I do not know how long Ill be here I want my time to be good. It does not have to be perfect it does not even have to be exciting. I just want to find someone settle down. Start piecing shit together. I want to be content when I die. I have always been an introvert. I have also always been an empath. And I have a difficult time telling people how I really feel about them. I just do not know what to do. I feel like my world is shifting into something new something foreign. I have started over so many times before. Each time I feel less and less like myself. I just want something to stay for once. Am I changing and becoming a better person or have I become someone else entirely? Am I no good anymore?,Depression
26613,Seriously when I look back at all my attempts all I am filled with is deep regret I did not go through with it. Not one single moment even the best of them has been worth the following pain and discomfort that I live with on a daily basis. I hardly feel anything for anyone anymore as well and it is just miserable watching all my current relationships slowly dry up into nothingness. I truly despise being brought into this god forsaken world Each day I do not off myself is another day I will regret later,Depression

26983,Hey guys I hope you forgive my poor englishI 22M was suffering from OCD and depression for 6 years i could not treat it properly because my family think i do not have a real problem that worth spending money for my depression kept getting worse to the lvl that the death i was afraid of and having ocd from it is now a wish my suicidal thoughts are just thoughts anymore and i almost commited suicide. I ve been alone for my whole life i only had 2 relationships in my life the first cheated on me and the second wich is my current gf start losing interest on me and disrespect me because i seem needy to her because i only have her i have 0 friends and 0 social circle she literally the only one i chat and hang out with because i feel loved sometimes even if show the opposite other times. Her behaviour with me is a breakup dealer but i cannot break up with her cuz i will not find anyone besides me.I live in Morocco where there is no free mental health providers but i need professional help and i do not know how to approach my family because i can only expect them to not take my problem seriously and will not trust that ibam really suffering they never trusted or believed in me my whole life tho.I need some advices on how can i tell them should i else someone elae to tell them? Can you guys give me some advices I need professional help but i do not know how can i convince my conservative family who dosen't take me seriously,Depression
9216,Before I explain why I am about to end my life I want to clarify that I am not advocating for suicide and if I could help it I would ensure that no one has suicidal feelings. But I am not in control. That said I just want to get this post out there as one final affirmation of my existence. Now as for why I am going to commit suicide there are two reasons My social ineptitude and my fear of human depravity. I will first talk about my social ineptitude and then I will delve deeper in the depravity of human kind and why it has fed my depression.I have been an outsider my whole life. While I did have a close friend group I never felt like I clicked with any of them on a personal level. Regardless of how much I tried I always felt different from other people and not in a good way. If others were to describe me they would probably say that I was weird or odd but not in any particular way. I am not sure how to explain it but I have felt like there is some part of me that is fundamentally different from the rest of humanity. In some ways I feel subhuman and that prevents me from actually forming meaningful connections with others. Speaking of meaningful connections despite being in my midtwenties I have been single for my whole life. I have not even held hands with a girl before. Yeah I know you are probably laughing at me right now but it is true. I have been rejected more times than I can count and honestly I try to tell myself that I have gotten used to it but really it is weighed down on me for so damn long. The only people who have been there for me are my family members but as fucked up as it sounds not even they are enough to keep me from feeling unbelievably lonely. I feel like if I cannot interact properly with others I cannot function as an adult in society and if I cannot function in society then I might as well clock out. Additionally I have been incredibly insecure about my mental and physical abilities both of which I feel like I sorely lack. This has also created a social impediment between myself and others as it feeds my inferiority complex. As for the second reason why I am going to kill myself most people are depraved. Plain and simple. I have been a true crime junkie for a while and hell has it taken its toll on my mental health. I cannot go outside without worrying that someone is going to shoot stab or kidnap me. You might be thinking that mass murderers and violent criminals make up a small percentage of the overall population and while true I believe that most humans are inherently violent. Humans are just as willing to excuse violence as we are willing to condemn it. do not believe me? Look at any video on Youtube with the title Homeowner shoots robbers in home invasion or something like that then go to the comments. I will guarantee you that most of the people in the comments section will rejoice and applaud the home owner for either gravely injuring or killing the criminals. Now I understand the appeal for selfdefense do not get me wrong. I do believe that in certain scenarios selfdefense is necessary but I do not believe that the injury or loss of a human life should be celebrated regardless of the person. The fact that this opinion is unpopular terrifies me. It seems to me that people inherently have a violent side. This violent side is also brought out when you add personal property into the equation. I remember a few years ago I read a news article detailing an incident where a store owner killed some guy who tried to steal a pack of candy from a convenience store. The website allowed for people to comment below the article and surprise surprise people applauded the store owner and praised him for killing some person who tried to steal a bag of gummies or some shit. I am still baffled that people think that ending a living soul for some candy was a fair transaction. This has further pushed me away from human interaction as I feel like I cannot trust anyone anymore. Which raises the question why am I writing this suicide note on a forum for the purpose of being read by others? Well I do not distrust all of humanity and I believe that this subreddit may have likeminded and kind people who will just let me say my piece before I die. In short I am going to kill myself because I have experienced extreme social isolation and I have developed a general mistrust of human kind. I believe if humanity works on its ability to empathize with others and to feel compassion then we will all be better off. Even though I do not know you I wish you a good day and a good life. do not live your life in constant isolation or in fear of others. do not live life like me. If you do you will regret it.

7816,Man when I thought these months were going good nope it was preparing me for this 2 weeks before I felt on top of the world nothing could stop me. I was getting over my health anxiety and was ready. I was also about to score a new job and leave this cruddy one. It was all going good until the next week. I found out that the job I was taking was a total scam. Fine time to just wait it out and try some online freelancing fyi first time. Oh look a job opportunity! Nope two more scams that further irritated me fun. Fine I guess I will try to hang out with some fiends. I call a few people and text no response for days. Now I am starting to feel the partial feeling of depression. Next thing I know my school work began to pile up and was now behind awesome! But the funny thing is the week ended okay for me that is until Sunday. Without any explanation whatsoever my exwho hated my guts after I broke up with her but I was cool with dmed me months after our last talk. Ok I am not upset or angry at her she changed alot and is happy with her new bf something I was hoping she would get but this was the match to light the fuel. After taking to her I began to see how much good stuff she is gone through the years and I should not have done this mistakenly started comparing her life to mine. that is where I took a total fall. I immediately blocked her because I was jeleous of her new lifemind you I wished for her happiness because I was so insecure at the time. Luckily she dmed me in a unblocked account and that is how I found out i was not inheritly mad at her. Now I am just at the bottom of my life. I feel burnt out and just lost a good deal of hope. I am so tired of having straight up bad luck I want good things to happen I also feel karma may have something to do with thisI am just done. The worst depressive wave this year,Depression
10872,I was 12 when I realized I just fucking want to die.In the 10 years since then there was not a single day that I did not regret just killing myself right back then. Yes I lived on. But I had already died inside. This sounds so dramatic but it is the best description of things. Anyone around me can see this. Not like anyone would actually care they probably think I have some mental retardation. Honestly I probably do. I have not progressed much since then. My personality has not changed significantly I have not experienced much anything I did experience felt dull. Like alcohol. It just raises my heart beat and makes it hard to walk. Or sex it is nice but the same way as food is nice. It does not give any meaning to my life. The only exception is mdma the only thing that has made me feel something in ten years. But anyways I really just feel like a ghost. Maybe I am who knows. It would explain a lot of things. I am really just a she will of a person. Like sorry I do not mean to one up anyone on depression. But when I hear stories of people that are depressed and just play online games all day or watch netflix youtube etc. It just reminds me how fucked up I am. Because I have to FORCE myself to do any of those things. Anything that is not lying in bed all day maybe scrolling through reddit to distract myself. I do not feel like continuing writing this. But anyways if I did not have a loving mother I would have ended this by now. there is nothing else keeping me here. Anyone other than my mum will do just fine when I am gone. I did not make a difference in anyone's life after all. I have been selfish only thinking about my feelings and letting anxiety keep me from doing anything good Trapped in this fucking existence because mum would be sad,Depression
19220,I am feeling myself slipping more and more back into my depression I am staying up until like 45am some nights and sleeping until 34pm. I am losing hope that my parents will actually accept me for being nonbinary. I have been daydreaming for 5 hours a day for so long that it feels weird to NOT be daydreaming and reality feels boring and disappointing. i do not want to have to live in this house for at least four more yearsuntil I am mentally and financially stable... i just want to jump onto a highway and end it. tw mentions of depression and suicidal ideation,Depression
23960,Found this group by google how I have been feeling for the longest time. Everyday I try to just sleep and stay in bed for as long as I can way past 2pm if I get up its for some mundane task or to take a shower. I have barely gone to work in the last few months using every excuse from Covid to just not feeling well lying about doing something else. I have all of the sudden just now look forward until around 6pm to justify drinking just to go to sleep and repeat it all over. Over the last few years I have exiled pretty much all of my friends by either just not contacting or making some lame excuse not to see anyone and some of the closest just blowing up on them for absolutely no just reason.. and if I do meet up with someone I feel like I am just glued to my phone and bored with that person that urge that I do not want to be there or talk its tiring feeling. Its almost like I do not care anymore. I am still fairly young in my late 20s. I have seen a therapist but she is a bit older and I do not know I do not feel like being put on any pills etc they were useless and just made me even more tired. How do you all force yourself out of bed and to do life? If that made sense? Do I create a schedule?Love to talk to someone that can relate. Sorry for the sporadic typing this is my first time really writing and trying to understand myself. Which I do not think is possible. Unmotivated and just wasting my days and life.,Depression
17458,I am not sure how much I can talk about Covid on this subreddit so if its not allowed please delete.I am fully vaxxed but I still got Covid. I am still sick with it but thankful it has not hit me too hard. I first thought I had a cold so when my mom asked me to take her somewhere I thought nothing of it. Now her and my 80 year old grandfather are pretty sick. Hes even in the hospital now. The fact that I caused this is killing me. I am trying so hard to not let it affect me this much but I just cannot. I got my family sick and I am terrified,Depression
10708,There is not much to say really my gp wanted to increase my dose and I increased it as well. I am kind of proud of myself.But at the same time I do not want to be here.I have a monthly calendar each day that I cross off is a victory I do not really want to be alive but yesterday instead of reaching for the 72 painkillers I had I reached for my antidepressants,Depression
14458,I thought today would be different. I woke up early for a change went for some sprints in the park sorted out some Centrelink issues Australian government thing and helped my dad build a vine fence for his garden. I asked my dad for a short break to do do some tasks like buy a new mobile plan and the above Centrelink thing. When I came back down he scolded me saying that i should have left my tasks for night and how shitty of a worker I would be when I actual started working ditching tasks halfway. I guess he wanted me to stick with him and finish his project spending my whole day. And here I am again feeling like shit again because of my father's disapproval. I cannot even talk back because he is got anger issues and goes full retard when I trigger him he smashes plates. He never spent any time with me and only scolded me since childhood and he expects me to want to spend my whole day helping his project. Fk me dead. I thought today would be different,Depression
37686,i ve been in a bad spot for a long time i ve dealt with a lot of grief a lot of handling shit on my own and trying to keep up appearance but thing took a turn for the worse when i had a traumatic event a few month ago that sent me over the edge i developed post traumatic stress disorder from it all and coping since ha been excruciatingly difficult i threw myself into work for about a month and a half i quickly burned out the trigger became an everyday occurrence i wanted help i needed help but i wa afraid every hand extended towards me would only reach to choke me those around me could drown me in an ocean of love and i d never feel wet my clothes may be wet but my skin my heart would feel dry a a desert i feel so closed off yet i crave closeness i can t even remember the last few month but from what i can i ve been destructive i ve been in so much emotional pain that i ve unintentionally caused emotional pain nothing is ever good enough for me it s not a conscious thing you see it s me i ve never felt good enough for anyone nor at anything i did these feeling of failure disappointment overwhelm me most day i m 0 without much to show for it this fight to see another day is wearing me out i keep getting knocked down and i know more is to come from life i just don t see an end to this emotional torture within my mind,Depression
25988,I know there is people out there who do not live in a depressed state and do not even do a great effort to stay well.Yes a lot of it is luck circumstances etc.But I believe that some people are simply better at managing themselves. Which makes their lives have a rythm they can dance to. I suspect a lot of it is unconscious and learned through their parents. So it seems natural.The big challenge for us who do not know how. Will be to figure it out manually and push the right buttons until it works. I want to get to a next level.,Depression
23919,My life has pretty much been a downward spiral for 10 years now ever since I permanently injured my right shoulder in gymnasium European equivalent of high school.The injury is what started it all but as time passed my depression gradually grew into what it is today in the beginning it was only negative thoughts about my injury but as time passed and the negative thoughts got worse they started seeping into every aspect of my life until negative downright self deprecating thoughts became the norm.I no longer feel like I am actually living my life it feels like I am just going through the motions most days I just feel numb and I cannot remember what it is like to wake up and be excited about the day ahead. But just to be clear I have accepted that I do not have it in me to kill myself but if I am going to continue living I do not want to continue down the self destructive path I am on. As for the lying part. As of writing this I am completely broke on the verge of being kicked out of my apartment and I was kicked out of my university for inactivity 2 months ago and after having studied for 4 years I am actually happy that I do not have to study anymore since enrolling was just a thing I did mainly to have a community to be a part of but it did not help me and the stress of constantly studying just added to it all.My family do not know any of this and I have been too scared to tell them all this but now I have reached a point where I do not care anymore and am actually considering telling them about it all. Also because they keep asking me about my studies and my life in general and I just cannot keep lying about it anymore I cannot keep track of the lies and it is tearing me apart that this is what my life has become. I am mainly considering telling them because I have come to the conclusion that I cannot get out of this myself and that I need help. No matter what plans I make to lessen the feeling of hopelessness they all amount to nothing as the crushing hopelessness of it all makes it hard must any energy to do anything but just drift along with whatever happens. I am considering just telling my parents about it all so I do not have to lie about my life anymore.,Depression

19918,little bit of background info I am a 25f arabmuslim who has never been in a relationship. i have typical arab features big black eyes long black hair etc. 170cm 80kg curvy I have been depressed since i was 16.4 months ago i lost a close friend of mine who never really appreciated me. i went into a spiral after that and realised no one really stuck around. I am a fairly good person who admits to my mistakes. I have been seeing a therapist and I have been working on myself and things have been going great but today i feel overwhelmed. lately I have been projecting my feelings into anyone i meet. my therapist chiropractor physiotherapisti chose them as males BECAUSE i wanted to see what it would feel like to have a man around me. they are all taken.I have recently fell for this guy i met online on clubhouse were a bunch of friends who hang out everyday and talk and hes so sweet to me i just told him i cannot go to sleep without hearing your voice and that that is weird to me and he said that i would change my mind when i wake upi took that as a no thanks. and i just started crying and have been crying the past two hours because a man has never admitted that he wants to be with me me or has been with me or love me or even loved me and proved it and i am realising i am so touch deprived that my depressions root because is being touch deprived and passion deprivedis this normal. why am i fucked up. i am so sad it hurts everyday. i make big scenarios in my head just to validate myselfwhat do i do. how do i get men to be attracted to a muslim girl who wears a hijab i cannot even take it off bc that is my religion every shot i shoot never goes according to plan. why do i feel like i need a mans validation why am i like this why do i project into people who want to help me i cannot stop crying at the fact that I have never felt passion,Depression
19430,My Psychological Health has been going rapidly down latly.The worst part is that I notice how my toughts get darker and more controversial like racism sexism etc.I was once in Therapy did not quite work I might be too stubborn and value therapist too little.Its summer time where I live everyone is on vacation or having fun in the Sun. While I isolate myself even harder and start to chain smoke just to pass the time even though the whole covid story is pretty much over.I am currently learing to drive it is not going too well. I feel so anxious even tho I have nothing to loose.I want nothing more then death however I believe that I will never actually do it. I will probebly get quite old with a lots of regrets and bad memories.Sometimes I am thinking about Evolution and Destiny. How do we humans evolve? I keep asking myself how our Genetics get filtered. No matter how much of a piece of shit you are somewhere out there is someone just as shitty as you waiting to start a family with you. To let the bad genetics live and multiply. For lives that are not worth anything. I believe that the only way we evolve is through death. Dying of the weak. Either you are stupidunlucky and die in an accident or have courage to kill yourself if you notice that your bloodline is unworthy. I feel or rather know that my bloodline is unworthy that it needs to pass away. But I lack the courage to kill myself and have enough luck and fear for my live to not die in an accident. But at the same time I fear growing old and the breeding instincts kicking in for me to have the sudden urge to have a family in my 30ths. I do not want kids. This life is not worth it. I should never put another soul through a life like this.But at the same time I should be happy. For FoodShelterWarmthHealthFinicial Stability a somewhat good goverment. All these things I take for granted. Still I am just always sadunmotivatedpessimistic.I do not deserve all these materialistic things. I do not value them at all.I do not really know why I wrote all of this. it is late and I need to vent. This post will not change anything. Nothing will. I do not know what to do.,Depression
47400,Kinda thinking I have highfunctioning depression? Hi. Im a 14 year old freshman. Recently Ive been sleeping in a lot to the point I dont set an alarm because someone will always wake me up. Some nights I skip brushing my already disgusting teeth because I dont have the energy for it. School has just been boring and sucky lately. A few times I get stressed or upset or dont do good at something I seriously start thinking about whether I have a use in life or whether its worth it to continue living. These thoughts always go away once Im in a better mood. Lastly free time is never fun anymore. Ill blank out and stuff or just not be able to relax.The only time I can relax is with my school friends or with my online friend. Or in bed making up stories in my head. But my online one is only available like once a day for a few minutes. Is this bad? On the other hand people in my life have way more stressful lives. Plus I have really volatile emotions so Im probably just overreacting and overthinking this. Idk. What are your thoughts?,Depression
13426,In the last few years my life completely fell apart my health went to shit so did my career prospects I am 33 and even though I did well in college and got into grad school I could not make it in grad school now I am back home living with my parents like a loser. Every time I try to pull myself up my health gets worse. I take a step forward and get knocked back 2. I am very close to just being done with it all. I hate reminding myself that unless I am done living then I have to keep trying.,Depression
19980,Trying to find the healthiest distractions when I am feeling low but all I can really do is sleep. Sleep until you cannot sleep anymore then up and thinking about a thousand different things. Idk what is supposed to help anymore. I really wish I could do something spontaneous like take off to another statecountry for a few weeks but I cannot do that. I really cannot come up with a new escape. Not even stupid reality tv helps. Distractions,Depression
23687,right now i am at my house alone for the first time and i really want to just stop everything. i cannot find my worth or a reason to keep on going. i do not know how to keep on going everything seems so blurry and unimportant i think ill fee at ease when i am finally done. i do not know why i am writing this here but my thoughts are killing me and i had to write them somewhere. hope you all have a good day. rn i am drinking alone in my house and i cannot handle my thoughts,Depression
7549,Life is fcking crazy I want everyone to realize how sad and weird life can get. I have been struggling deeply for the longest. To be honest I do not know why I am still going but I am hoping one day I can look back and be glad that I am still breathing. Everyday feels the same. I am constantly thinking about suicide but Ill probably never do it. Its a really sad feeling when you have no one to turn to. I am so scared of the future and where Ill be. Am I destined to be alone forever?? I have always thought it was cringe how people just rant on Reddit but here I am on Reddit. I hope I can look back on this post and remember these times. If anyone ever reads this.. know that we are looking at the same stars and moon and that you are not struggling alone. Everyday feels the same.,Depression
21671,I feel so stuck. Like an imposter. I feel worthless and unmotivated for most of the time. And as if there is nothing in the future for me. Like everyone else is way better than me and I can never be good at anything. I have little energy for most of the days still I have some days of being okay and in most ways normal. But the former take should again. But I often feel like I am doing all these to run away from stuff and am faking it Am I faking depression?,Depression
10856,I have awful headaches all the time and my brain is just so scrambled I compulsively think about things and I cannot calm my brain down. I just jump from one thing to another. I have a hard time articulating words or explaining myself or thinking things through or even feeling things socially.I feel nauseous alot and completely empty I do not care about anything. I cannot commit to any job or school or even sit down and read a book. I feel very little emotional and feel like my perception feeling existence is not even based in reality anymore. I am just weird and burnt out and scrambled.Doctors tell me I have depression and ocd and have prescribed me ssris and snris but I cannot commit to taking them because I do not beleive they will work. I beleive they will make me numb and my dick not function and probably just take away some obsessive thoughts. Does this sound like depression?,Depression
22899,I feel like I have no time for me anymore. I am going to be 24 soon and feel like I have wasted my time away already. I used to love watching TV shows anime reading cuddling my cats writing. And now when I get home I just want to go up to bed. I am just exhausted mentally. I am staring at a screen 8 hours a day. Dealing with patients on the phone sometimes with them screaming. I get headaches near all the time with the stress. I worked part time but decided to work full time due to needing more money for doing my driving lessons and hopefully getting a car. Do I need these things? No. But it will take less time commuting to and from work if I have a car. What I really want to do is all the things I used to do. I want to travel. I want to gain social confidence. Make some friends and maybe for the first time in my life get into a relationship with a man. However I feel I have no time to do anything. Too mentally drained. I want to be left alone and on weekends I feel the same and try to recover so I can get myself together for another week. I do not know how to have a work and a personal life at the same time. Sorry. I just had to let this out. Life is not good for me atm though ik I should be grateful. Working 9 to 5 as a recent graduate earning a bad wage is depressing me. How do people live like this ?,Depression
39404,i just have random racing thought about the past song etc mostly it s just a constant ear worm it s a bit annoying but i can deal with it but a lot of thought about the past have made me cry due to the nostalgia aspect of it not sure if this is anxiety or something else,Depression

11738,I have always felt I was a ugly guy or at least when I was 10 or 11 I started thinking about looks and hating mine. I am recently being told in therapy that my self image needs real work. I thought most people hated the way they look. Turns out everyone dosent like something is about themselves true but hating every thing about you enough to get angry and upset at pictures and reflections is not normal. So I tried the mirror bullshit of saying you are attractive myself but I couldng get it out. I was like Jim Carey in Liar Liar where he cannot say something hes knows is not true. I have been trying posting and allowing pictures of myself and even when I get compliments I cannot believe them. I will probably delete the one I put up not long ago. I thought I could handle putting up the pic but now I feel ugly and stupid and like it got to go. Trying to not feel ugly and failing miserably.,Depression
37918,i ve been experiencing huge bout of just feeling unmotivated not useful i ve been randomly just tearing up but it never last long i don t feel like i have a reason to cry but i do and i don t know what to do there s other stuff but i don t want to drag on too long i also just miss how thing were i ve woken up like this for the past week and it s persisted throughout the day,Depression

47253,I feel things getting bad again For context 2022 was the YEAR of my life. I lived abroad and had a blast. My anxiety was still there but at a minimal. I never felt so happy. So happy at times I felt like I was going to burst. It was insane. February of this year I came back home. Home isn't a good place for my mind. My parents are awful and I always feel like I'm dorwning when I'm home. I've been home since February and I feel things going dark again. I'm sleeping way too much. Have no energy or desire to do anything and the awful thoughts of mot living are coming back. I'm in between places right now. Kicking off a new career that's why I came home. But things are going slow and I cant move away right now. I feel like I was on the bery top of life and now I'm in rock bottom again. I'm lost and confused and my mind keeps things how easy it would all be if I just want living anymore. I dont want to have these thoughts or feel this way.,Depression
39043,my anxiety ha been taking over my life recently and i am having trouble controlling it it seems like i am always assuming the worst possible outcome for everything i somehow convince myself that the the worst will happen and that i need to prepare for it i am not sure where this way of thinking came about a my parent and my brother are super laid back and relaxed even during my college year i would panic about exam i would study all weekend skip going out worry constantly for test i would run through scenario in my head about failing not getting employed dropping out etc i would calculate the minimum grade needed to pas the course and convince myself that even though i studied 0 hour getting a is still likely and possible if my brother doe not pickup the phone late at night i worry that he crashed somewhere is not safe every night before bed i have to check my car app to make sure it locked even though i know i locked it and if i dont check i assume it is unlocked and will be stolen i worry about my health even though i am healthy it s getting to a place now where when someone tell me something that go against my worry random example you do not have a cavity i assume that he probably missed it and that i do have one it like i always have a sense of fear for everything now i am working full time it effecting me with my work life even worse to make thing short i sell capital equipment because of the supply chain issue many of current order have been delayed i run through every scenario possible that my customer will sue me for loss of profit and not delivering on time even though it is out of my control i worry that i will fulfill the order late and my customer will not pay me net 0 are the normal term in my industry i worry that my equipment will not work properly i worry that i am doing something wrong with running my business i also randomly started worrying about my equipment hurting someone and being sued for it and liable for everything it seems like i always have something to worry about when the stress from one thing pass something else come up and it constantly cycle these are just some example i seem to always go to the extreme with everything even though no issue have come from everything mentioned above i still worry about i have absolutely no idea how to control it i get random thought before bed while i am half asleep about something and it immediately wake me up and i start to panic i get super irritable when i am in an anxious state and my parent think i am just being dramatic and tell me to settle down when i can t i feel helpless it almost feel like the littlest thing can absolutely destroy my mood i have no energy to workout constantly tired no motivation to eat until super late at night i cant meditate and shut off my brain it s impossible doe anyone have any insight on how i can improve myself i am struggling finding anyone in my life that can support me i never really assumed i had any sort of gad until this past year when i started doing more research around the topic i assumed everything that i wa experiencing wa just a normal part of life until it became too much to the point where it controlling my day to day life,Depression

39931,while i wait for my school counselor to give me an update on the whole online school therapy thing i wa convinced to check out a confidential free and text based crisis hotline it s apparently designed for teen like me who have noone in their life that they could talk to now for me personally my experience wa subpar i don t want to disrespect the volunteer work there but after the successful attempt one in the morning and one just hour earlier i felt like i wa just a number on a waiting list the system constantly kicked me out of the conversation and the one time i actually had a decent conversation it felt like they were trying to cast me aside a quick a possible a soon a i mentioned that music help me organize my thought at time they told me to just listen to music and the conversation closed immediately after maybe i m stupid or maybe it s just my anxiety and paranoia but they seemed annoyed i guess it would help to say what i wa expecting i wa thinking it would be a deep dive into why i feel the way i do but it wa more just a short session of giving me a metaphorical ice pack and sending me home with an old stale lollipop if i didn t feel worthless enough already then well a for the nd successful attempt it wa even shorter they asked me how i wa feeling they asked a question to confirm what i said i answered and then the very next message wa telling me that i must ve stepped away and that the conversation had been closed the automated reply also hit me with a stinger saying you matter it doesn t feel like it it doesn t help that i had to reply stop over and over because i kept getting auto reply from the bot needle to say i have le faith that online school therapy will even put a dent in how i feel tldr seeking help a many advise when situation like these crop up hasn t worked this time around and my already weak ability to see a good future for myself ha withered away a bit more,Depression
18251,they always talk about reaching out because people do care and this and that. its such a lie. no one actually cares about me. i may be surrounded by people but i feel more alone than ever. its so cheesy to say that no one understands me but how else do i put it? i try talking about it to someone they make it about them. to another person they literally just do not pay attention to what I am saying.I am not saying i want to be the subject of attention at all times. its nothing like that at all. I am not even that forward about how i feel. i barely talk about it because ill only end up disappointed by their lack of care. sorry this is written terribly swear I am more cohesive when I am not purely desperate to talk about literally how shitty i feel all the time no matter what i do. I am exhausted. this weight on my chest never leaves. Literally no one cares,Depression
17736,I feel like I am failing as a dog mom in every way. My depression has been getting worse by the day and by the time I get home from work everyday I have zero patience or energy to deal with him. My husband and I have only had him for about a month and a half and hes about 9.5 months old. Hes incredibly rowdy attentionseeking and a huge sweetheart but I cannot seem to help but be a jerk whenever hes around because I just feel too overwhelmed to be around him. I cannot help but hate when hes under my feet all the time and constantly trying to jump on me or lick anywhere that skin is showing. Were trying to train him and hes progressing rapidly but I still cannot seem to find any leftover patience.I have always been a dog person. What happened to me?I feel like the worst person in the world. I feel so bad. I love him so much and want him to feel loved. I just do not know what to do. I am a horrible dog mom.,Depression

23493,ampx200BMy depressed friend two weeks ago told me that its better for us to stop talking and asked me to stop texting her because she thinks she is toxic. After that I told her I do not find her toxic and that I am grateful for having her in my life. I went a week without talking with her at all then I talked to her at the gym as if nothing happened. Fast forward a week I texted her saying I was thinking of her since I had not seen her at the gym. She replied me normally. was it the depression clouding her mind when she asked me to not talk to her again ? Did I do the right thing ?,Depression

I went to the hospital once a few months ago but I do not think I expressed my problem well enough and just ended up getting sent home right away It essentially accomplished nothing if anything it made things worse. It made me feel like they did not care enough to help or that I would need to attempt suicide for it to be taken more seriously. Now its a few months later and I am becoming very suicidal. The feeling just keeps growing and growing. I keep staring at bottles of pills waiting to build up the courage to just do it even though I really do not want to do it. Mainly due to the fact nothing feels like it will be able to help me at this point. I feel permanently and irreversibly damaged. But for my mom I need to give it one last shot. What I really want to know is from the people who have been in either inpatient or outpatient programs what is the overall experience like? What should I expect? What is done to try and repair my mental health? Any details on the specific types of therapy and strategies that they use would be appreciated. I am an extremely nervous and anxious person I would love to learn more about what I would be getting into it might make it a little easier for me to give it a shot.Thank you what is it like getting help at the hospital? What should I expect?,Depression

39384,ok i have social anxiety i m actually quiet smart however when i m in social situation the anxiety is so much my brain go to mush like simple thing like counting money etc is so hard because my heart is beating through my ear i also dissociate ha anyone else experienced this phenomenon when i m by myself i can do all these task easily but in front of people literally become an invalid like it hilarious how people dumb down thing for me sad but all you can do is laugh,Depression
21591,I am completely opposite. Girls says I am all sweet and stuff and they thought I am really looking for a relationship. But for me. Its not like i do not want to take it seriously i just want to have a light relationship without defining of mine to each other. Then I will got butterflies an often do not go further once i felt they are stepping up for more. And just kill the fire. Some would just me that I am just playing and just using my looks but truth be told is I do not know because I am scared enough of obligation to have a relationship. I did have some symptoms of performance anxiety either if its job related or sports. Because of some trauma i received during my childhood days. Maybe it could be related ? Why i stay away from women?,Depression
7805,I have been pretty down lately and now I am on the fence weather tomorrow i should go see my doc or not. I am starting to giving up with my meds but i still want to be better. I do not know. Please help me. Can anybody please give me any reasons why i should continue see my psychiatrist? Really need some support right now,Depression
11349,I am honestly not really sure where to ask this but I am very confused by who I am supposed to confide in and for what.I am finding that my meds for depression are not working and my doctor said I should see a psychiatrist but then when I tried getting a referral to a psychiatrist they said my doctor should be managing my meds? My doctor also said he suspects that I have cptsd so should I see a psychiatrist to get diagnosed? Will that help me?One thing I do know is I need a therapist so I am in search of one but I am so confused about everything else because even medical professionals are giving me mixed responses. Thank you. Psychiatrist psychologist or GP?,Depression
24687,I hate myself and who I am becoming the best thing is for me to die. I cannot anymore..,Depression
12502,i am so just tired of everything. nothing seems to go my way and it seems like i have no one and nothing. If i died i would not see a problem and it would solve many things. I am the worst i have ever been right now.,Depression
40739,swoyer you don t understand depression whatsoever it s not something you have a universal method to fight against suicide isn t the first choice it s the last it s when the year of fighting constant suffering and lack of hope finally outweigh the fear of taking your own life,Depression
21444,Unfortunately I am 17F and three months away from turning 18 I do not expect medical advice but just to rant. A year ago I was in a psych ward after a previous attempt of suicide and I was assigned to see a therapist since I got discharged and I had multiple fucked up episodes since the most recent one costing me my job temporarily. I was out of work for a month my therapist told me it was likely I have bipolar disorder and assigned for me to see a doctor the next month. We do not have a car so my narcissistic father had to take me but told me he could not take us he did not want to do it because I yelled at him for yelling at my mother for asking for financial support and saying that that is exactly why he left her. He refused to take me after waiting a month for care because I swore at him for blaming us for his bullshit narcissism. He said to my mother until I apologize for my actions he is going to stop taking care of me dental needs doctors appointments etc. My mom does not believe in medication and I am not really a fan either but since bipolar has been pointed out to me the hallucinations paranoia insomnia impulsive decisions and suicide attempts make sense because of the dramatic shifts in my moods a few times a year. I believe I am manic at the moment because my decision making gets waaaaay more fucked up than usual and I am loud fast talking energized and have not slept for more than 5 hours a night and now I am not sleeping at all regardless of 9 hours shifts at work. I only have insight now because it happened to me so many times. I am really irritable at my mother because I have to be like this because until I am 18 I have no say in my care. She does not believe in medicine and I do not like medicine either but I do not want to be like this anymore. She calls me dramatic when I feel like I am going through hell in my mind. Everyone just feels the need to call me a bitchMe Did not sleep AT ALL after closing at work and when I almost had a remote chance at sleeping my niece starts screaming her head offMy sister who recently shit on me for crying about a recent miscarriage I had at a baseball game and asking to go home when she wanted to see fucking BIG AND RICH lmao literally yelled at me the whole time for asking to leave in front of zillions of people starts hissing at me and blaming me for waking up her child when she was clearly already awake and screaming when I got upMe Pissed because of thisMy sister you are SUCH A BITCH! Then there is my momMe exhausted but cannot sleep due to the episodeMy mom Take out the garbage.Me Okay.My mom I said do it now! I do everything around here and you just lay there.Medid not sleep after work just hates life in general and does not want to react the way I do but she keeps freaking out IT WILL GET DONE I PROMISE YOU!My mom You always say that. You always have to have things done your way. Proceeds to threaten to call my dad or someone to yell at meMeYells expletives out of extreme anger starts screaming and covering ears because of sensory overload and BEGS her to leave me alone because NOTHING would be more relieving at that pointMy mom Walks away you are so dramatic.My mom does not get that I have a disease in my brain. She makes me live like this and it makes me so angry when she says stuff like that.My dad in a nutshell Is bipolar himself narcissistic and blackmails me for taking care of meI hate it when people try to tell me that it is because I am a teenager I want those people to go to hell. I have tried to die 3 times cannot function without a stimulant lost a child was shit on for having feelings about it have abandonment issues because of my dad leaving when I was one forcing me to be in this world with these problems and then replacing me AND HE STILL does not LET US FORGET! LOL not to mention people who have called me a mess and left and used me on a romantic level have three current diagnoses already and if I express myself I get called a bitch or Somebody has it worseI am done.I feel like genuinely crying but my moods will not let me. I deal with manic episodes and I am called dramatic by my mother who will not let me go on medication Not as long of a story as it looks,Depression
25068,I did not start at this company 21 years ago with any ambition or goal other than to have a job. I just stayed . . . and stayed . . . and stayed wasting away my 20s 30s and into my 40s. My role has changed significantly and I am currently making more than ever because I was asked to take on different roles. However I am absolutely miserable and am at a low point with this job. I had an argument with a person I have worked with for about 19 of those years someone I would consider a friend. she is upset with my management style and I also made a ridiculous mistake a little while ago that could because some problems. What comes with such a long time at it is a feeling of not knowing what I would do without this job. I would feel adrift. I have a job I am looking at but I do not know all the details or if I would like the environment. I just like the schedule. I would probably make about half of what I am currently making. So let us say I get that job and it sucks. What would I do? I have been at my job way too long.,Depression
38457,i feel trapped and like there s no way out everything feel like shit i went through ton of family and mental health issue but i soldiered on and i got my college diploma in social science and my bachelor degree in sociology i wa on the dean s list i worked my as off through mental illness and exhaustion and i m in thousand of dollar debt i did everything people told me to do keep going get a degree take out loan and now i can t find a fucking job that doesn t pay total shit public transit is beyond atrocious i just have 0k debt staring at me in the face every time i open my bank app i ve applied to hundred of job hundred of job my brother want me to go back to school and get more debt more fucking debt he want me to leave my boyfriend and move to another province i can t talk to him about my issue because every time that s all he suggests same with my best friend my dad life in a tiny town in newfoundland and make shit wage my mom life somewhere in ontario and ha made no effort to help me out despite not getting to see me grow up due to a nasty divorce i have no will left i m afraid i m gon na snap and go crazy i try really really hard to be positive but it s really hard to keep it up i feel like i m in one of those trap where the wall are slowing squishing you until you die please doe anyone have any advice anyone i m dying my hope is fading so fast,Depression

16793,Quote from my dad. he is wrong. I do not care about videogames either. There is nothing in life that matters anymore to me. You do not care about anything except videogames,Depression
18180,I am sure at least some of you might have experienced this in the past or currently. I feel emotionally numb to the point where i feel like my family would be better off without me. As many of you have already expressed i do not want to kill myself but would not mind at all being dead. Yes i have thought about maybe doing it myself before but currently I am not in that phase. I just started meds a little over a week ago so hopefully this gets better but it is rough to be with your awesome family and feel nothing at all. Like i know i love them but cannot show it and when i try to show it i feel like it is looks forced. Does this go away with meds? Does it get better? Anything that helped you? Thank you in advance. Hope your day is a wonderful one. Emotionally Numb,Depression
9584,Every day at some point at least once my brain reminds me of how weak I am and how much I fail. My girlfriend is out of town for the moment and I have been avoiding telling her how I am feeling because I do not want to take away from the fun she is having with her friend in Maine. there is so much I want to tell her so much I need to tell her. I am falling apart and its my fault like it always is and I do not know if I can step foot in our favorite ramen place ever again. I am sorry I continue to fail and I can never succeed in being normal.For context me and my girlfriend of almost 19 months are very close and happy with one another but one of her best friends constantly makes me feel uncomfortable due to events in the past and how she would be dry with me but not as dry with him in our group chat that I have been gone from since that day It was her birthday and she asked if I could go along with said friend who I am uncomfortable with. I told her its your birthday of course you can and she asked her friend to come. And she was worried before and she asked me if I would be uncomfortable and I told her no. And I failed her. I was so uncomfortable the whole day I was falling apart and she trusted that Id be fine. She trusted me and I disappointed her. For most of the day I wanted to push myself to talk to her but as she was mostly with said friend I could not do it and was trying to give myself as much space as I could. I know I am such a pussy. I was falling apart and I was breaking down. I just stuck with her dad while the two of them walked around. When we went to said ramen store with all four of us I left at some point to sit outside and try to calm myself down. And later on when the day was finished we talked about the day and we talked about how badly I hurt her and how badly I made her feel that she could not even talk to me on her day. I am so fucking sick of myself I try to be the best I can yet I somehow fail. Its been a week since that day and were both trying to forget about the pain it still haunts me so much even though she is forgiven me for it. Remnants of that day tear me up and knock me down and I just want to get away from it. I want to hit myself. I am sorry for everything I am sorry i did not do enough. My mistakes continue to torture me in my head at least once a day,Depression
11655,About two months ago I was out of state to visit my friend of 10 years well say M and i stayed for 2 weeks. During this time I was fighting with my boyfriend and she was instigating hard along with her mother which then put me in a place to break up with him. We got back together 20 minutes later knowing this is not something that can be done from another state like this and M being disappointed in me says do not worry when you break up when you get back you can come stay with us again. this did not sit right with me because she said When. So a week after my trip while I am home she stops responding to me for about a month then out of nowhere sends a huge paragraph about how my boyfriend is breadcrumbing me and isolating me from my friends. She said this because when she texts me i take a couple hours to respond. M is however notorious for not responding for days weeks or months. Since over a month ago I have not had any connection with her other than the one message. I responded but she still has not. My friend of 4 years b I did not usually hang out much but since my relationship was becoming more steady and we were learning to take out time apart I started hanging out with her more often. She lives about 45 minutes from me but i did not mind since i enjoy the ride. Around a month ago my boyfriend had broken up with me and was very shitty about it i was sure it was going to be the last time. So i went to Bs place for comfort and to calm down. She makes me promise not to get back with him and her boyfriend who was also my friend gave me a whole lecture on why my boyfriend is a pos. Naturally I went back to my boyfriend G anyway. we have broken up plenty but only gave our belongings back twice or so. Our relationship is more dramatic than anything we know that but to my friends its abusive. I have reason to believe M and B just wanted me to listen to them. To be in control of me. My boyfriend is nothing like how they portray him. However that is the reason they cut me off was because i took him back. Most people have just given me the advice of hanging out with family instead but everyone knows the difference between a friend and sibling. I do not have a close relationship with them seeing as i do not do well with the brutal honesty and bluntness of their personalities. The conversation will always come down to why I am so full of excuses when they ask about my mental health. Recently I have been spiraling in my depression and i genuinely have nobody to go to other than my boyfriend but your partner cannot help everything. My social life is important to me and watching my boyfriend be harassed and loved by all of his friends makes me feel so pathetic. I decided to start going to the gym alone to help dilute the feelings but it just makes me lonelier that i have no one to talk to. I have always attracted people who take me for granted or want to control me because I am easy or impressionable.I also suffer from PCOS and I am supposed to be getting a diagnoses for bipolar. All of these things are putting me in a position of feeling like id be better off in a psych ward. Not for protection but so that i will not be a burden on anyone or myself anymore. I have been inpatient before and while its not fun it will make everyone else happy. I lost everyone.,Depression
39414,i believe it s a psychosomatic symptom in my arm but what s it called when you overthink about a limb and hyperfocus on it it feel weird like nothing actually wrong but it s a constant focus because you re thinking about it it s like if you overthink about a word it start to sound weird i hope that make sense i m not really sure how to refocus my attention off of my left hand feeling uncoordinated when it s not but it feel like it is like i m hyper aware my left hand exists and i know that sound so silly but any insight on how to stop this or redirect my thinking i don t feel like being in this rut any longer,Depression
39790,doesn t seem like i m contributing enough to the world for my life to be so precious that i need to still be here i don t know how to do this but i have considered hanging myself or starting my car in a garage for the carbon monoxide my financial issue will never end my disability is chronic and it doesn t seem like there is a point in fighting any of this anymore,Depression
22731,I confided in my husband that I feel trapped in my existence and that I think everyone except my son would be better off without me but he needs me so I am here. My husband then started yelling and cussing at me screaming at me to man up and grow some balls and yelled repeatedly to me to leave him and go away and called me fucking pathetic. I cannot even describe how alone and depressed I am and how much worse that made things and reinforced all my beliefs about my useless sad existence. I confided in my husband and it made things even worse,Depression
24201,Men are not meant to be unconditionally loved. we are loved only if we have something to offer. A good heart money or looks. Lack in am area and we are called useless.But even if we are loved does not mean they can see our pain. Each day pain stakingly earning and hiding our wounded heart each time we cannot afford the luxuries we wish we could give our loved ones. Our pain does not matter,Depression
19059,RantI am 20 and I got my first job last week. I am in for a shift at 400 today but I am already dreading coming in. it is at a fast food place and I am working at the till becsuse they have not taught me anything else. I hide in the corner where the icream machine is to look busy pretending not to see people queuing up because I am scared ill mess it up becsuse I do not know the register yet and I do not want to be saying huhwhatsorry all the time because of the noise and masks.it is a small place so with the masks and the noise from the kitchen its really hard to hear people.I am terrified of phones. I get nervous when the phone rings when I am left alone at the front. I do not know I hate it but when I try to explain or think about it I cannot find anything to say. Maybe because its not as bad as I think but with my fear of people and wanting to double check what everyone tells me etc. because I am paranoid I will mess up or forget something but as the same time I do not want to ask people because I do not want to be seen as clingy or strange.I think I picked the worst job for me but in the village I live in there is not much else and my parents were always going at me to get a job. I am just glad I put myself down for part time because I do not want to be in there but at the same time if I was in full time I would have figured out everything faster i still do not nowI just do not know what to do. I want to quit but it seems pathetic for me fo just quit after 3 days and I have nothing else lined up .. it is only my 3rd day of having a job and I already cannot take it,Depression
21280,I do not know when I became this way. Talking and getting to know people feels so monotonous. I already know the conversation will reach a lull or go somewhere I am not tryna take it. Since apparently I am lacking in personality. I feel like there is something about me that makes me hard to love or even like for me its like I can only deal with people in small doses. Yet loneliness still comes creeping in. Truth is I want to talk to someone.. on a deep emotional level. Yet I find everything so predictable now a days. I know its me. Not them. In general everything seems quite pointless. I have been depressed or just saddish off and on since I was 7. I am 19 and I am afraid this is all there is to life. I feel that I am destined to be this sad miserable numb empty she will of a women and all I want to do is sit in my bed and cry. But the antidepressants will not let me. Talking to people feels pointless. what is wrong with me ?,Depression
14550,Please let me preface this by saying I am not trying to insult anyone or flex or brag and I am very aware a lot of people are less fortunate than me. I work 3 jobs 7 days a week 60 or so hours a week. I pull in. 2400 a month sometimes up to 3000 and have done so for the last year. My monthly expenses come to about 1700 a month and yet I never have more that 300 or so in my account unless I plan on buying something big. Last year it was 1200 on flight sim controls I think I have used like 10 times since I bought them. I have slowly added more pieces to a drum kit I can hardly play I just rebuilt a new computer two months ago and last week I bought a 3D printer to make DnD minis. It was not until two days ago when I started looking for a bigger new computer case for my just built rig that I realized that I am just spending money to buy stuff I do not need.I think I am doing this because I constantly feel lonely. No significant other and I do not really socialize outside of work. Does anyone else spend money on expensive things like this? Again sorry if it sounds like I am bragging. Spending money to fill the hole??,Depression
39582,we ve been seeing a worrying increase in pro suicide content showing up here and and also going unreported this undermines our purpose here so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guideline about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide we ve created a wiki that cover these issue we hope this will be helpful to anyone who s wondering whether something s okay here and which response to report it explains in detail why any validation of suicidal intent even an innocent message like if you re 00 committed i ll just wish you peace is likely to increase people s pain and why it s important to report even subtle pro suicide comment the full text of the wiki s current version is below and it is maintained at r suicidewatch wiki incitement http www reddit com r suicidewatch wiki incitement we deeply appreciate everyone who give responsive empathetic non judgemental support to our ops and we particularly thank everyone who s already been reporting incitement in all form please report any post or comment that encourages suicide or that break any of the other guideline in the sidebar to the moderator either by clicking the report button or by sending u a modmail http www reddit com message compose to fr fsuicidewatch with a link we deal with all guideline violation that are reported to u a soon a we can but we can t read everything so community report are essential if you get a pm that break the guideline please report it both to the reddit sitewide admins http www reddit com report and to u in modmail thanks to all the great citizen of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for u r suicidewatch wiki incitement http www reddit com r suicidewatch wiki incitement summary it s important to respect and understand people s experience and emotion it s never necessary helpful or kind to support suicidal intent there are some common misconception discussed below about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide there are also people online who incite suicide on purpose often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful validate feeling and experience not self destructive intention we re here to offer support not judgement that mean accepting with the best understanding we can offer whatever emotion people express suicidal people are suffering and we re here to try to ease that by providing support and caring the most reliable way we know to de escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood that mean not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are or telling them what to do or not do but there s an important line to draw here there s a crucial difference between empathizing with feeling and responding non judgmentally to suicidal thought and in any way endorsing encouraging or validating suicidal intention or hopeless belief it s both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone s suicidal thought without putting your finger on the scale of their decision anything that condones suicide even passively encourages suicide it isn t supportive and doe not help it also violates reddit s sitewide rule a well a our guideline explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdiction do not treat any op s post a meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can t change their mind or be helped anyone who s able to read the comment here still ha a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living even if they ve also been experiencing intense thought of suicide made a suicide plan or started carrying it out in the most useful empirical model we have http www apa org science about psa 009 0 sci brief the desire to die by suicide primarily come from two interpersonal factor alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer these factor usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world so any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent even something innocent like i hope you find peace is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person s sense that they re unwelcome in the world it will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded how to avoid validating suicidal intent keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide people who say they don t want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn t invalidate their emotion unfortunately many popular good response are actually counterproductive http www speakingofsuicide com 0 0 0 what not to say in particular many friend and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that it s not so bad and this is usually experienced a i don t understand what you re going through and i m not going to try people who ve had help that made them feel worse don t want any more of the same it doesn t mean that someone who actually know how to be supportive can t give them any comfort most people who are suicidal want to end their pain not their life it s almost never true that death is the only way to end these people s suffering of course there are exceptional situation and we certainly acknowledge that for some people the right help can be difficult to find but preventing someone s suicide doesn t mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding an unfixable problem doesn t mean that a good life will never be possible we don t have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better it s important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstance and our inner experience is weaker and le direct than commonly assumed for every kind of difficult life situation you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair and others who cope amazingly well and a whole spectrum in between a key difference is how much inner resilience the person ha at the time this can depend on many personal and situational factor but when there s not enough interpersonal support can both compensate for it absence and help rebuild it we go into more depth on the it get better issue in this psa post http www reddit com r suicidewatch comment igd whats wrong with it get better what if it doesnt which is always linked from our sidebar community info on mobile guideline there are always more choice than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their life to avoid accidentally breaking the anti incitement rule don t say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thought is a good idea or that someone can t turn back or is already dead do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome at least in this little corner of the world our talking tip http redd it igh offer more detailed guidance look out for deliberate incitement it may come in disguise often comment that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishist and voyeur unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon http en wikipedia org wiki william francis melchert dinkel people like this are out there and the anonymous nature of reddit make u particularly attractive to them they will typically try to scratch their psychological itch by saying thing that push people closer to the edge they often do this by exploiting the myth that we debunked in the bullet point above specifically you might see people doing the following encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying there are always more and better choice than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or helping actively or passively them to end their life creating an artificial and toxic sense of solidarity by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy they will represent themselves a the only one who really understand the suicidal person while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self loathing emotion and self destructive impulse since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation many suicide inciter are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activity while actually luring people away from source of real help a couple of key point to keep in mind skilled suicide intervention peer or professional is based on empathic responsiveness to the person s feeling that reduces their suffering in the moment contrary to pop culture myth it doe not involve persuasion don t do it cheerleading you ve got this or meaningless false promise trust me it get better or invalidation let me show you how thing aren t a bad a you think anyone who lead others to expect these kind of toxic response or any other response that prolongs their pain from expert help may be covertly pro suicide of course people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental health treatment and it s fine to vent about those but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else s hope of getting help choice made by competent responder are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone s trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible any kind of involuntary intervention is an extremely unlikely outcome when someone consults a clinician or call a hotline confidentiality is addressed in more detail in our hotlines faq post http redd it c ntr the goal is always to provide all help with the client s full knowledge and informed consent we know that no individual or system is perfect mistake that lead to bad experience do sometimes happen to vulnerable people and we have enormous sympathy for them but anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need please let u know discreetly http www reddit com message compose to fr fsuicidewatch if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviour we don t recommend trying to engage with them directly,Depression

11759,I try to distract with doing things or going places or seeing people I care about. I recently moved into my own place got a puppy made some new friends. I feel like reasonably I should be in a good place mentally I am enjoying more out of my life than I have in a really long time. But I cannot stop thinking about killing myself. What do I really have to offer the world? I have too many things wrong with me to make me a worthy person I feel. No matter what I do I cannot get past my own head. Things can get really really good and then something drastic happens that just throws me right back. I cannot stop thinking about killing myself,Depression

18138,Hi everyone. My wife is struggling with depression. she is had a lot of sadness her whole adult life but recently she seems less able to cope. I am trying to encourage her to get help but she likes to keep her feelings locked up tight and here is the idea of talking to someone about things.She agreed she might try an app or something similar so was wondering if anyone has any ideas or recommendation. I think something with actual contact with therapist sounds most useful but fully open to thoughts or suggestions. Depressed wife,Depression

22922,Hey. Thanks for reading. I am 22M from Europe and I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder OCD and anxiety last year. I have also spent some time in a psychiatric ward and was doing SSRIs and benzodiazapenes. The because of my depression was a series of traumatic embarrassments and mistakes which I mostly caused myself. I was never really a good decision maker even though I have read a ton of selfimprovement books and whatnot. I had a real hard time remembering the things I have learned from them and often act out of emotionimpulse. To make everything even worse I was rejected by a girl I was infatuated by because I was behaving very cringey and she found out embarrassing stuff about me. I have left myself too open and vulnerable to people that did not deserve it in any sense. And it hurts.I am a high school drop out because my biggest passion was to pursue a music career rap. However I was also thinking finishing my last year in school and go to college. Mostly because I want a plan B if I will not be able to make money from rap but I also think it would help my depression. The depression itself is the actual thing that keeps me from doing the stuff I love keeping me stuck in the past feeling intense anxiety because I am now afraid what people think of me and I never had that problem until now. Is it possible to reach happiness again so I can become the athletic quickwitted confident happy guy I was before things went south in my life? I also want to dedicate more time to the gym amp writing lyrics but I just lack the motivation to do so. Can I pull myself from this dark amp scary rock bottom I am at and fulfill my dreams? I hate wasting my life but at the same time cannot just shut off my depression. Peace. 22 years old and depressed. Can I regain my confidence amp happiness and become successful in life?,Depression
18698,You know what I really hate ? it is when you lower your expectations so much yet you are always hit with a new level of surprise. You start making excuses for your dearest It just happens that my lows catch them on their busy time and I understand really well that I am not entitled to anyone's support not financially or anything just a simple cheering up but this simply cannot keep happening especially since in my case even when I try to distance myself because of the feeling of betrayal they always comeback when they are in their lows and I simply never turn an eye on that because up until recently I thought that is the norm yet time goes by and the same circle repeats itself. We all have problems because sure life is a bitch but it is just so much harder that the moment you are ready to fight them just the knowledge that the people you thought would be there are not you lose your footing to a scary degree. I have always overcame my depressive episodes but doing it for myself is not going to work forever. I have caught on hobbies stayed away from any kind of addiction focused on my carreer but none of them seem to work long term simply because this is a personal battle never have I had one single suicidal thought that I could brush off with oh but you will never be a world class guitarist or artist if you do so. Those make a great way to pass time and change the perspective too but they do not stop it from happening. At least not for me. I really want to learn to love life I appreciate so many things the strays that come for petting and as much as I know the next lound sound going to scare them at this point I could almost count on them more than I count on people. I am just tired of all of this. I am sorry for the long post this is was just something I needed to get out of my chest. there is something sinister in being used to feeling abandoned,Depression
25995,The older I get all I can do is laugh at the sheer absurdity of life. I wake up eat breakfast work a soul crushing job for 1012 hours go home eat dinner shower sleep and do it all over again. I am supposed to be grateful for what I have but I am not. I hate nearly every detail of my life. I want to make changes but that seems like an insurmountable task. I have shut myself off from everyone except for my SO but I have been keeping them at arms length too. I will not let anyone get close enough to see just how knackered I am by life. The numbness I feel is only topped by the bitterness that caused it. When my fractured mental state is on the verge of collapse I just start laughing uncontrollably. I see now that none of it matters I am just another grunt trying to make enough money to survive. If anything happens to me only a few will be affected. I have suicidal thoughts not tendencies at least not yet. I think of death almost nonstop. I welcome the idea of dying almost every waking moment try to keep myself distracted from it not always successful. I honestly think I died 10 years ago and have been stuck in limbo would certainly explain the absurdity of the last 10 or so years. But if that is not true then I must be insane or delusional at the very least. I go down that rabbit hole on a near daily basis. I am not even sure I want life to be real anymore. Maybe I am just trapped in someone is imagination or vivid dreams. What is real life how do I return to it or do I stay trapped in this cycle of trying to break free of some self imposed prison for mistakes I made years ago. I cannot always distinguish fact from fiction but I also feel like I am just punishing myself. Pushing my mental state further and further down into the abyss. My moments of clarity shine through and I see how silly and trivial it all is but then I slip right back into this farce of an existence afterwards. Life seems like a sick joke,Depression

18964,Drawing is the only thing I have. it is the only thing that makes me feel ok sometimes and I occasionally take commissions because it makes me happy to be able to draw for other people but my mom wants me to turn it into an actual business a full time thing and I keep telling her that I do not want to because I do not want to grow to hate my hobby I do not want to grow to hate the one thing that makes me happy and I know I will if I am forced everyday to do commissions and she just does not understand that and she always tells me that I am being stupid and that I always think I am right and it fucking breaks me down so much I was just coming out of a depressive episode and now she is just fucking pulling me right back into one and I do not know what to do....One of the reasons I am taking some commissions as well is so I can get out of this house even for just a weekI just want to feel ok again I need to rant...,Depression

47351,So is this what it's all about? I'm not saying I have a plan to leave but man I'd really like to leave but due to familial and religious obligations that won't be possible. I found therapy to be just regurgitations of the same message well that's too damn bad or just don't think like that anymore instead think like this. I've tried many times to completely change but I always revert back to the stupid self. So how do I endure this carnival ride til the sweet embrace of death? I'm 31.,Depression

Now I do not know where to go or what to do with my life anymore and its driving me insane...I have always been a pretty cheery guy but these past few years have really solidified my loss of direction. I feel like I have no sense of self anymore. I am smart physically capable no records even own my own car. But I still feel like its all in service to nothing. Should I just strike out and try and get my own place? Then what? What do I do with it?! What is my purpose!I never really thought like this before a few years ago. Stupid thing is nothing even happened no big break up or great loss in my life. I just woke up one day and started asking why. Ask enough times and eventually the silence starts to eat away at you at least it did me...I do not really think I believe in suicide as an answer here but it would be nice to not feel so damn alone and isolated in my own head. Maybe I just need someone to share the space with. Someone to reach out and grab onto just to make sure I am still on earth from time to time. I do not even know anymore... Sorry I do not know where to put all these feelings. So I will leave them with you...,Depression
21846,I am so tired of my dull and meaningless life. I am alone all the time and it feels like everyone is out having fun without me. Whenever I try to actually do something and change my situation I freeze and get scared and ruin my opportunity. Like I had an opportunity to fly to another state in the us for a summer job but I was too scared to go into the airport for the first time by myself. I want to change but my useless brain will not let me. I am trapped in anxiety or something. What is my problem and how do I make it stop I cannot go on like this anymore please help me. I do not know how to make it stop. What is wrong with me?,Depression

26331,Thank you for all your advice. Unfortunately I have nothing and cannot afford a solicitor or lawyer he has left me 11000 give or take. I cannot afford my phone bill let alone a rental place.Effective of last week his dad asked me to leave the property. Id just started to come to terms with all and then this just swept me away.I am currently sleeping on my brothers daughters floor he has a lot going on and no room for me so I appreciate this but its not convenient for anyone. They have no room to move themselves let alone a grown women who is living out of travel bags. I miss my dog I miss my creature comforts I miss my favorite pillow from my bed. I was just told to leave he came back and caught me packing and demanded I leave I was packing and storing my stuff wrong.Today I registered with my council as homeless a year ago I was planning a wedding now look at me.I am not pregnant and I have got a floor to sleep on so I am not considered priority. Life fell apart lost house partner wedding and son. Part 2 homeless,Depression
47489,So tired of being the person laughed at and not taken seriously. I'm a bit of an introvert but through the years I learned to appear social and outgoing with people. In most contexts it's positive and useful. But in others things turn out terribly for an actually shy and introvert person. I sometimes make jokes about memes funny videos etc. It's a good way to engage with other people at work for example. Rest of the people do the same. It's not that I'm joking more than the rest of the people. I never make jokes about the others I'm very respectful. I even avoid any joke or meme that might be hurtful to other people. Yet there's always a moment where people go from laughing with me to laughing at me. For example now people at work make fun about my poor diet. I never detailed anything about what I eat or if I had time to cook. And some of those people bring canned food. Or about some of my habits. When stuff like this starts happening I feel really hurt. It's like I thought for a long time I was sharing funny moments with workmates and actually everybody was clowning me. There are some ridiculous things about me. My voice is high pitched and soft for a man my age 37 and that would be a main thing. I'm gay and that makes it even more obvious but I don't talk about my sexuality since it's private. I wonder if these aspects make me the target of getting laughed at when actually I'm being friendly like the others. However I no longer care. Once I get fed up with all this I avoid any unnecessary socialization with people who hurt me. I would consider to say what I wrote here in a polite way but it's impossible to do that without being looked like a dramatic person. So I've decided to not eat again with this people just go outside or stay on my own. Not the first time it happens to me but the first where i can just avoid it easily. I don't know why I trust people again and again. I know people are not evil per se but other people can really be hell for depressed persons like me.,Depression
13345,So if these are the best years of my life and I am miserable and this is the only life we have but I am having a miserable time the suicide is justified yes? Logic?,Depression

19480,I am just going to leave this here because it will be too long a read for most but to those that do read it thank you for listening.My family has always had a difficult time in life my father died when I was young leaving my mother a widow with two young children. She worked two labour jobs to keep us fed and pay bills as we got older we helped as much as could financially. Ill skip every detail but a few years ago my sibling had made some poor decisions and it literally bankrupted my family. We lost everything we were living in motelshotels I have even slept on floors of my friends I have starved on occasions and its been tolling on my family. As a disclaimer we are a family of three we do not have family or relatives to help us out we had no friends because nasty rumours had circulated about my family. In no way do I blame them for making the mistake I accept my situation but recently its been too much for everyone.Then it happened the strongest woman I had ever known broke down I have seen her cry on occasion due to my sibling and I arguing and it makes my mother feel like a failure on top of all that is going on but today was like no other. I had always been depressed and when the times got too hard for us I am so ashamed of myself but I actually suggested that we take our own lives. I know its shocking and unfathomable but we were all we had and I could not see the pain and suffering any longer. They said no obviously but today my mom said she was ready to go because she does not have the will and spirit to keep fighting. To what she said we obviously denied her and told her it would be ok but it took a lot out of me to hear where she is mentally. Were not suicidal just tired of the situation because if you can imagine the worst case scenario this is what it is. We have barely any money no credit no car and currently in a bad housing situation that could end with us being evicted at any moment home of my mothers half brother and his toxic wife. The backstory to that is that he had a heart attack and no one to care for him we were asked to look after him his wife wanted him dead so were at odds over that. Our current financial situation does not allow us to move no credit to top it off. We pay for food for the whole household another 4 people on the weekend gas for the car you name it. Oh how I wish I could tell the whole story its incredibly sad. The saddest thing happened today,Depression

But not today i do not even know where to start. I just feel so overwhelmed and cannot even think. could not find my stud finder so spent 30 minutes looking for a shirt to go to home depot and just kept staring at my laundry basket but not even going through it to find one.

47829,Literally can't find purpose in life My life is alright but I'm very depressed all the time panic attacks suicidal. I feel that nothing in life matters and that life is some weird thing I can't relate to. I only live for sex gambling and money however those things don't even bring me happiness. I can't do relationships. I push people away unintentionally and hurt them emotionally. Every. Damn. Time. I wish I could give a fuck about life but I can't. Why am I still here? I suppose this is a rant I just wanted to talk to someone haven't really done that in a while. I'm thinking about doing some dumb shit like live 10 more years save every penny then bet on red on roulette. If it hits cool I'll double down if not who cares. I've felt no attachment to anything or anyone recently. I'm applying for a job this week had a job before had some savings I just gambled 1k ate a steak dinner and burned the rest only had like 9k. There was no turning point in my life where I suddenly didn't care about anything. Since I was a little kid I can always remember having schizophrenic episodes but was discredited as I was just a dumb kid. I would always see shadow people and be irrationally scared of the dark and I would see monsters and just scream and cry silently. All the way until I was 14. Then I stopped paying attention to it and just realized if I didn't care then it doesn't matter. I had a girlfriend once. I was with her for a week we fucked once we went for 5 hours I just got up and left at one point. Never talked to her again. Hate my family but I'd do anything for them. I hate religion I hate politics I hate material things I hate people I hate consciousness I hate breathing I hate thinking I hate eating I hate sleeping. I hate life. I can so easily be anything I want in life that it becomes obsolete to try to live. Life is just creating problems and then finding the solution endlessly. Refused to take medication because why would I want to feel a way that I don't? Not going to trick myself into wanting to live that's stupid.What is life and why do we exist?,Depression
25153,I do not feel anything anymore i can cut my wrist and not even feel it. I see no meaning with my life. People telling me it will get better and that i will not feel like this forever just makes it worse. I am not seeking help here i do not want people to try to help me no more. This is more like a last goodbye. Thanks to anyone that genuinely cared about how I actually felt. Nothing except suicide can help me anymore. Goodbye. I do not feel anything,Depression

25358,I thought I was doing better after getting out on meds. Maybe I was for awhile but now I am not. I still think of suicide everyday. I still think of hurting myself. I guess the only plus to being put on meds is not having the constant breakdowns I was having everyday before. Anyone else experiencing this? I have no clue what to do. I truly feel like life is not worth living. I am unhappy most of the time. For the last 78 years I have only experienced very temporary happiness. I feel like a terrible person for feeling this way. I have a mom who loves me family who loves me a house to live in a job friends dogs. I feel like a burden my mom will not allow me to keep the meds in my room due to past suicide attempts and the frequent thoughts I have. I need some advice. Maybe I am not doing so okay,Depression

26759,I know its pretty minor but I have been down lately and not being able to enjoy the 4th because I have work early tomorrow is fucking me up. Depression just makes everything even worse. Something about having to work tomorrow and not being able to enjoy the fireworks is fucking me up right now.,Depression
21882,I am in the worst place mentally that I have ever been in since I was first diagnosed with depression 6 years ago. I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I have a job and I work around 2535 hours per week but it takes up all of the energy I can possibly give and when I am not working I just sit at home and do nothing most of the time. I do not even enjoy watching tv or movies anymore. I have no motivation or energy to hang out with friends or family and I always end up cancelling plans. This is absolutely destroying all of my relationships and I hate it so much. The most basic tasks like brushing my teeth or showering feel impossible a lot of the time. I feel like a failure and I am only 19 yet I feel like my life is over. I am so depressed I cannot even watch tv anymore,Depression
18190,Ill do my best to keep this concise but I think context is important. I am 24 and I lost my way big time.I moved back home 8 months ago working a remote job that pays really decent money for the country I live in. Its an uninspiring job but its fine. I do not love or hate it. I also found my passion a year and a half ago writing. It consumed me. Every bit of spare energy I have goes into it and a lot of time. But there is big missing piece. I want to start my own family meet someone nice and settle down. Thing is after a 5year relationship that started in highschool I spent the last 3 years single which makes for a total of 8 years since I have been on a first date. I have no idea how that works now but I had my writing excuse. My bubble.I told myself everything can wait until I am published. Writing comes first. And for a long time I was happy with that and hopeful. It does not work because you are not trying duh.Something changed a few weeks back. I realised that was an excuse more than anything and when the opportunity arose I tried to flirt. Be nice hang out. Still have no idea how this works and my confidence was at an all time low going into this so I am not surprised I failed. But here is the kicker. After a long introspection I realised that for the last few years I have been feeling inadequate. Despite having a good job passions and being in pretty decent shape my life is off the script.After uni I have finally been free to make my own choices real choices. So there is no road map and there is no way to feel adequate when there is no rules that define it. I tried seeing this in a positive light but all I get is more dread and fear of something. I am on a downward spiral. I have been to bad mental places before and I can feel it coming. That choking sensation when I go to bed. The random things that make you want to cry for no apparent reason. The mental exhaustion. I am not great headed for the bottom of the pit.there is a question in there somewhere.

14679,You see I am younger 15 to be precise and when I look at so much they accomplished it makes me feel like shit at my age in Sengoku Jidai there were literal 15 year olds who actually fought with bravery hell there are people younger than me that have more talent and will grow up to be something my point is there have been so many people who have done more Octavian Augustus was 18 fucking 18 when he lead Rome against his enemies point is every day I see people doing more than I could ever do I am not even sure if I am depressed or if I am looking for attention and even myself does not realize it which makes me feel worse I almost feel like a side character in my own life my sister is studying to be a nurse and getting good grades my older brother can sing a little my mother is developing her own company for makeup and other products and when I try to enjoy history it feels like the world keeps on putting examples of great accomplishments in front of my face sometimes I even cry while watching history videos not out of pity for them but out of disappointment of myself The thing is I cannot find one thing good about myself and I cannot see why living is even good if you have a ambition you can never reach because you lack the skills needed why do you struggle the only reason I live now is out of fear of death of course I do believe I am going to the asphodel meadows when I die but I still fear death and I am hoping one day if it does get worse I will at least have the heart to act it out instead of turning back like I always do Looking at history make me feel inferior,Depression

25601,Downloaded a game just so I could play with my friends I ranked up did that for days to a week and just when I talk to them while I was playing all I got were oks and dots crap that made me frown quickly. I clicked off the window right fast and contemplated what the fuck was I doing really. What am I doing? Jesus Christ what in the fuck am I doing. Playing a game for the sake of someone is presence,Depression
20524,i have not felt like myself since probably the beginning of freshman year. nothing feels the same and time went by so fast I am jus constantly stuck in these thoughts of confusion. i am going into my senior as a 17 year old. i have experimented with drugs a lot to escape a little but i think all that did was make things worse because when I am on drugs i feel better but when I am off them i feel even worse then i did before i took them. everytime i try n be sober i cannot never escape it because i do not feel like myself being sober and everyone i have ever known love to party or smoke weed. and i just do not really know what is next i have a good job and a good future i just do not know when I am going to stop feeling like this I am going insane lol,Depression
19912,I just do not know what I am supposed to do anymore. I have not had a holiday in 3 years no relationship either I am putting most of my money into repairing my parent's house but it is just not enough. My dad needs heart surgery now so I will have to pay debt for another few years. I am just so done. I am an only child so there is no one else to take care of the house or help my parents. And it is pretty bad like this summer there was a storm and water got into the ceiling. I cannot invite anyone oever we do not even have a bathroom. Why was not I born in a western country or in a richer family? I try to go to sleep every night by imagining I have a proper place to live in. I feel like I am going to make a bad decision some of these days. Is this how bank robbers are born lol... Poverty is just eating me away,Depression
47320,Me24m her25F BPD amp Sex Drive? ok so Me24M have been with my gf25F for a little over three years. We have had a very very difficult relationship! Recently have found out that she has BPD! We have had problems with being intimate with each other for majority of the relationship! She had given birth to her kid just a few months before we got together so I figured it was post partom. Granted I have been a bit understanding not the best but Ive tried very hard. However it will be 4 years soon since shes had him so Im not understanding as much now as to why its such an issue to want me! We will have literal fights about it cause I feel like Im not loved or wanted! She always tells me its not me and its just her head but as a person who has A LOT of mental disorders I just cant seem to believe her! So now she gets diagnosed with BPD and Im wondering if this would have an effect on her sex drive also! I also have BPD but I still have a sex drive Its getting to the point that I want to leave the relationship cause Im not getting what I need! I have a VERY high sex drive and she was told about this when we started dating! I love her with everything in me and would love to spend the rest of my life with her and our child. I just dont know if I can continue to go on feeling like this every time I want to be touched,Depression
8580,Feeling less motivated by the day. Use to heavily train at gym almost everyday now thought of putting myself through all that taxing work makes me groan internally. do not like looking in mirror despite being objectively good lookinghot or taking time to self analyze. Feel lazy and just want to smoke weed and do nothing. have not had a relationship in 7 years since fucking middle school have not gotten laid in a year have more fingers on 1 hand than I do friends.And the hate for myself is growing every single day. I may have people around that want to help but I would never and will never confide to them. They will never understand what I am going through or why. I think depression is upon me,Depression
23301,I feel like I have been taken advantage of my whole life. I was molded into this helper figure that everyone just uses and toss away once they are finished. They are hundreds of versions of myself and non of them are the real me. I feel so fake and that I do not belong anywhere. I want to die so much I want this pain and hopelessness to end so much. My life was never mine,Depression
47577,Every single person I've told that I'm depressed has left me. They all leave. They say they are there for people but when you actually are in that place they say nothing and stop talking to you. It is so hard to struggle every single day and to have people see you struggling but choose to do and say nothing. They say open up to us. When I do they explain it away. Depression is hard because yoy are completely alone. It's like being stuck in a desert there's no hope and no respite just death.,Depression
12039,I do not like anyone trust anyone or love anyone. Even if there are people like me ill never find one cuz were all stuck in our own worldI have not been depressed for so many days this year. Yes I had suicidal thoughts last month but this time it feels worse. Even suiciding seems meaningless. Like I am already dead so there is no need to kill myself twice. Even suicide seems meaningless at this point,Depression
19400,everything is falling apart. i feel like a horrible person cos i let my insecurities get the better of me and i ruin friendships. i feel alone and worthless and stupid. and i feel like everybody hates me cos I am so annoying. i tried communicating with a friend that i felt lonely and she said it feels like ur trying to guilt trip me. and idk if i am but i was not trying to. i feel needy and disgusting and i would do anything to be someone else i do not think I have ever been more disgusted with myself ever,Depression

14808,My friend seems to be very depressed and has slowly been pushing me away and now completely ignores me. We work together a few days a week and now she refuses to even look at me but talks to everyone else. Its hard to even be around her because I feel like she hates me and it makes me feel like I am weird or not likable but I just know she is going through a lot. I have tried reaching out to her telling her I am there for her but she ignores me. I am just wondering if someone has treated a friend like this before and what its like from her perspective because its driving me insane. Depressed friend ignores me,Depression
12174,HelloI do not have anyone to talk with so i will write it here because i have need to ventilate my feelings out so thanks everyone for hearing me.Since childhood i'v been always fat. It was caused by bad working thyroid gland and excessive sugar income. And it is well know that fat people have really small penis in my case i have also circumcision because of something that happened when i was really young. My face is also not one of the most beautiful. Because of that my self confidence is literaly below zero.I had a crush for 13 years on primary and secondary school. I never told her that i was in love with her.First of all it was just because of lack of self confidence. When i was older i realized where is relationship there must be sex. And i cannot have sex because of my problem i mentioned.I had to cut all our connections and go on in my life.Once there was girl and it seemed that she may like me or even love. I had to send her away cut all our connections and go on in my life. I did this everytime with every woman i'v met because i was afraid that even with my look friendship with girl could grown in something more serious.There was a time when i came to terms with it and i peacefuly lived on. But last couple years it is killing me I am crying almost every night I am not smiling anymore and this loneliness is really painfull.I would like to have a person i could share my life with enjoy moments of life together smile and love each other. But i know i cannot fulfill women's desires. I'v always figured out all my problems but this.. i just do not know what to do how to fix this. that is reason why i will be forever alone and will slowly dying inside with emptiness in my life. My destiny is to be forever alone and it is killing me inside.,Depression

10927,I am so desperate. Maybe not. But. I want connection. And tbh. Female connection. I just wish I could fast forward 2 years of my life and see where I am then. I have social anxiety and its incredibly difficult to be around ppl or just get up because of depression. I am trying to reach out irl not just on the internet but that was an important first step. Its just so hard. The progress is so slow. I am going to group therapy. Individual therapy. Spravato esketamine therapy. Had bad mental illness for 7y now and at the current rate of progression I do not see me getting better in less than 30 years. I am already 24. I just want to be a normal young adult. Be able to talk to ppl. Be able to feel connected connect. Go to school provide for myself or have some source of income. I cannot take much more. I cannot do the rest of my life like this.I get better at certain things socially and mentallyslowlybut my phq9 depression scale just continues to get worse. I get more and more hopeless.

Things are looking good,Depression
7703,I have had larger amounts of stress happen compared to now but it feels like I have only now caved from it. I left my job about two years ago to take care of my dad while I was in school. It was hell watching him get worse without being able to do anything. I still managed to stay on top of my grades and responsibilities. He passed months ago. Nothing seemed right after but I had to carry out his will handle his funeral etc. so it kept me from just sitting with my thoughts. About a week later I found out my SO was cheating with his kids mom. My grades slipped that semester but I got them back up and got a new job. Continued repeatedly dealing with shady behavior from SO and being promised change. My mom chose this period of time to behave like she had not in years disappeared when she met a guy and does not really come around and cancels when I have tried to come see her. My parents divorced when I was young she was not close with my dad.These past few weeks I feel I have let myself go. I was struggling with my classes and have just stopped working on them not even checking the grades. Letting my exnot ex SO continue to be around despite asking them to let me heal and move on. they have been attentive and loving and stopped drinking but it does not feel the same anymore. I do not think its fair to them because I do not have hope that were going to last and I do not know that I even feel sad about that after giving so many chances. Its not healthy for either of us when there is no trust. I procrastinate all responsibilities and do not really see myself with a good future anymore just getting through each day. I feel the panic of how bad I am messing up but will not do anything to start fixing it. I have just mentally checked out from everything aside from my job. I am not sure I want to see a doctor because I fear they will just send me on a journey of different medications to try. Even small tasks like calling a doctor seem strenuous. I do not want to talk to anyone I know about this because I know every person is dealing with their own problems and cannot really help with mine anyway. Just needed to get this off my chest. Stuck,Depression

39710,i ve been with my fianc two year we are both trans men in our mid 0 he ha been severely traumatized and ha ptsd for the past year especially after starting a grueling job that take up most of his time he ha become more and more depressed and suicidal he ha a history of multiple attempt i try to encourage him to talk listen and validate distract with humor and cheer and offer way to help i m not perfect and a lot of time i think i just make it worse by doing or saying the wrong thing or just maybe how i am i ve offered to pay for a hospitalization i ve offered to help call for therapist i ve offered to support him with saving so he can quit his job and take some time to heal but he refuse he won t accept any financial help i argue that his health is more important long term than money for the future but he won t accept it he can t trust his family either he oscillates between desperately wanting mental healthcare and mistrusting it due to a totally reasonable reaction to past experience lately it s just been so bad he is so dysphoric and every time he s reminded of his appearance he begin to spiral i can see it tonight he told me it s been the same a long a he can remember that he can t enjoy anything that he think about doing it every minute i listened and tried to comfort him and after a while asked if i can set a day to leave voicemail for some therapist he said i ve been trying to do that for the past two month i said i would sit down with him to help tomorrow and he didn t answer me he looked completely dead inside he told me he wanted to be alone and went to sleep on the couch he is asleep right now i feel like the weight of this is so heavy on me he is such a kind loving smart and beautiful person inside and out the person i want to marry and spend my life with but i feel like that person is disappearing into a void a year ago he had so much life in his eye i have severe adhd and anxiety and also am autistic i struggle a lot with executive functioning and forget important thing constantly i think i might by nature be a bad support though i try my best i probably seem distant and apathetic often i will never give up on him but i m barely capable of managing myself and i know i can t handle this alone i know i should not have to but it is how it is it s really getting to me and i have been becoming extremely depressed myself for the first time in a while we are set to marry in under a year i think delaying the wedding might take stress off but it feel like any major change i suggest would freak him out i just don t know every time he go out alone i m worried i could lose him i make sure not to be overly invasive or anything if i called the hospital or his parent he say it would just make thing worse i m just hoping when this job end in a couple of month he will be able to breathe a little i love him so much and my heart is hurting i m so scared i think he need more friend therapy time to himself and a different job but a much a i ve tried to i can t make that happen for him i feel so lost i just don t know there is no answer,Depression

7382,I know you are not supposed to drink depressed amp alone but it always makes me feel better. Everyone who tells me not to says it is because it will make you feel worse but it always numbs me and makes me feel better. I have not drank alone in a while but I did tonight quite a bit and I am a bit concerned I will go on a binge again.I do not drink during work but I had a week where I constantly drank after work and it started with one night like this. Not sure what to do... any replacements for alcohol? Drinking to cope,Depression
20588,We have been in a lockdown for about 2 weeks but I have been in isolation for months since losing my job. The only time I leave the house is for food or cigarettes. Before I was fired I was fired for swapping shifts to prioritise my mental health which just made it even worse lol I was casual btw I was always socialising and hanging out with people after workweekends but as soon as I stopped initiating things I have not had a call or text from anyone. I have become so numb to the world and every day is just the same boring shit. I live in a pretty small community so the only thing people my age do is drink at the shitty local bars. I struggle to find new things to do in this town and just want to fkn escape but I cannot right now because of lockdown. I was kind of glad I could not do anything for my 21st considering my awful mental state and did not really have high hopes for it but I kind of expected maybe a call or text from even just my close circle of friends who I still play gameschat online with. Nothing. I was waiting around all day with my phone on me and not once did it buzz. I am totally fucking giving up on everything and am the loneliest I have ever been. I know I could just pick up the phone and call someone to do something but I do not want to do that when no one even bothers to check up on me for months even on my fucking 21st. Supposed to be an important milestone or whatever but these cunts in this shit hole town do not give a shit about me. Just want to move away and start my life again. Anyway its 3am and I just needed to get this out to someone even if its on reddit. Lockdown 21st,Depression
7899,Maybe the song Achilles come down has it right.it is just so weird how people treat relationships how easily they discart it for something better how much being with someone gives you hope until it is just another reason to commit suicide not like a broken heart will necessarily make you jump but for a time in my life I even tried pursuing a relationship because I know it never works with me because I knew they made me want to kill myself but it was never enough and it seemed that no amount of birthday wishes would bring me closer to not existing anymore.But you know despite all the bullshit the little broken pieces of me i left scattered behind and just giving up on everything I still manage to stumble into someone I love by accident and this one is truly special and different in a way none of my relationships was before. But it just makes me wonder how ironic it would be if it just broke appart and left me so much less than the little I am now if hope and love just serve as entries when the main dish is always misery and hopeless and I wonder if everything falls appart again will I just be someone looking for hope like an addict looks for his next fix or will I be lucky enough to never wake up again. Love is such a scary thing,Depression

27081,So I am struggling with anxiety and extreme lvl of stress agony and at certain days depressionI most likely have depression anxiety pure ocd intrusive thoughts ADHD and executive dysfunctionBut I need to make money too I am 24 and I mostly studied did not find my path yet and that is depressing enough even if I do not think about other things in lifeI used to do art at times but I stopped as at every stroke I would criticize myself too much just too much at every stroke so yeah I stoppedThree days and I saw someone wanted a commission I tried getting online stuff but could not get it so I thought I can see the pic and decide if I can draw it They send me pic of idk a fully crowded room wanted it in watercolor they asked for rate and even though I knew I should not I just honestly said I never done commission and they can choose price they said 6.75 dollars it is not much but I said ok I will give it a try if they do not like it they do not have to pay and if they do they can pay me that amountSo I started but here comes the part that I think was development I lived extremely sedentary lifestyle these days like 5 days in a row I woke up with a lot of stress and probably had panic attackSo I tried to do it yesterday when I tried painting it it did not work out I got tired I thought I should just tell them I cannot as this is just making me stress more is it worth it for just this much but I was in the situation if I told them I cannot I will make myself suffer too as I will be like I gave up an opportunity no matter how small that came my way and I had to finish it no matter if they pay or no I have to finish it Otherwise I will be more disappointedSo today again I tried from scratch and I had even bit of argument with my lil cousin who was like they are paying too much like I was like 6.75 for hours of work is not much and then she said extremely rude thing but I did not let it make me depressed also the voice in my head who was like I cannot do it after yesterday this time today I just wanted to first shut it as much as possible second think good weirdly I did not felt tired while making I made for around 23 hours I feel more tired when I am just laying down which makes me feel I have no energyFinally then I send it to the person I told them they can take it if they like or otherwise it is ok too And I told myself there is no need to be depressed for days if they even say no they might just say yes idkI think it is a progressTho I did not do this in a day it is combination of me living with depression for long months or more and I know it will not change on it is own handling worst of OCD intrusive thoughts long realising I cannot follow a schedule especially after sedentary lifestyle I have to listen to my body or I will just burnout Handle all the useless negative thoughtsIt's like you are fighting an enemy for so long on repeat and you do get weaker but you also know what they will do Fighting our own demons,Depression

26230,what is the point of existing in the melancholy of a word built on unequal terrain of despair and false hope. There are people who walk blind to the world and get to live happy and wonderful lifes but if your gaze if adverted and the truth is revealed is when the world get ugly and unforgiving. Were just toy puppets for someone to get amusement outa and nothing in return and if there is something it not even worth a single breath. And the things you care for and think you want well life will only give them to other people and keep you in the dark once you have seen the truth. If you are happy is only because it wants to you to because your blind and unknowing and watching you people is sickening living your unfair and joyful life wail people a stuck under there feet because there better there is no better there is fair and unfair so I guess it time to get used to it Life,Depression

12167,This will be my 5th therapist. Idk how I can ever be normal again. On paper I really am a crazy person. If I were smart enough I would program me a bot that can act as my therapist. I just need someone to tell lots of shit to and occasionally talk back. Therapy is tricky though because each time they hit a wall with me and I can tell they have lost all interest and they run out of things to say and just bs. So it always ends the same but I need someone to talk to and at the same time I just want nothing Think I might need therapy again but it always ends the same,Depression

25463,My life feels like its slowly getting worse wtf is wrong with me?here is my story despite all these things happening it feels like I was happier at the time than I am now.1. Married an abusive psychopath of a woman divorced about 5 years ago which was probably the best thing I have ever done for myself did not get 5050 custody of the kids.2. Dated someone really unstable after that extremely messy breakup have not really been able to love or bond the same since.3. Burnt out at work shortly after. Before that I was on the line for a huge promotion. Since then I have never been able to focus or get through work like I used to. Started to struggle with suicidal thoughts 4. Met a really great woman that loves me way more than I deserve supports me all the time. Its so weird I feel like a she will of the person I used to be and must suck to be around why does she feel like this?5. Ongoing custody battle.6. Found another job which although not the promotion I had once hoped for pays really well and is my ideal job.At around 3 the depression hit I hopped on meds for 6 months until the suicidal feelings passed but after that I stopped taking the meds.Up until about then I was still able to find joy in life really small things like taking a walk taking some photos getting coffee hanging out with a friend. I feel like my life has never recovered from items 12 and 3.I feel stuck in an emotional and mental limbo. I cannot think about fun things or holidays. I do not look forward to anything or want to be around people. COVID Lockdowns have just made it all worse.Am I still depressed? I must be but I just do not know how to kickstart my life again. Real question am I depressed? WTF is wrong with me?,Depression

26859,I really just do not know I feel selfish when I want to help someone and they do not want it or when I look forward to things and they do not follow through even when I do help people I feel selfish because its something I wanted to do for them and it makes me feel better about myself.I cannot figure out if I am just selfish when I get depressed that I cannot go put a smile on someone is face. I do not know how to even tell if I am just being annoying selfish and bugging people for caring too much? Is it selfish when I get upset that people do not want to do anything when they are depressed even tho I understand how they feel? I just hate myself so much when I cannot help and then I hate myself when I can help because I feel like I do it to feel better. Am I selfish? I seriously cannot figure myself out,Depression

15987,I am currently visiting my real estates in Italy and I thought this would bring me some happiness since it is pretty exciting. But it does not. I cannot wait to leave I would even prefer to sell it all. I just feel so empty I am pretending to have a good time to the people and friends around me. Yes I had some tough times in my past I just do not know anymore what it needs to bring me joy. Sorry for such loose sand words here. I come to a point where I simply do not care anymore. Empty,Depression
47521,I don't want to do this anymore I 23m don't want to continue this anymore. I got out of a 6year relationship back in august I left cause I wasn't happy anymore and hated myself to the point of not loving her anymore. I was 320 lbs when we broke up and now I'm 240 lbs I go to the gym for about 10 hours a week sometimes more. I'm stronger than my friends that got me into the gym and that makes me happy sometimes. I see a therapist every other week and I don't even tell him about some of these deeperdown issues about not wanting to live anymore cause he is a school therapist and I worry that I would get a restriction on campus cause of it. I have been on one date since the breakup and I really wasn't that interested in the girl I met her on an app and just went on a date so my parents would get off my back about not going on a date since the breakup. I feel invisible to women I'm actually attracted to that in the gym or around campus I try to smile and make eye contact but I can count the time's anyone has actually looked back and smiled on one hand. I feel like my depression ruined my one chance at love and not I'm just a fat ugly person who is going to die alone no matter how much weight I lose no matter how much better I look I don't think it is ever going to get better. I did get with my ex for a moment but I think my heart is truly empty there were no new feelings of love I think I need someone to kick start it I need someone new to care about the bring those feelings back. I don't know how long I can continue this life I feel like my peak is going to be 5 years from now when I'm still single and alone and graduate from school and am making 100k and have a nice scat pack challenger in the garage and my ram parked outside in a luxury one bedroom apartment. I'm on the apps and I get like maybe 5 likes total a week over all of the apps I'm using and I usually get ghosted after the first message. since I updated my pictures recently I have been getting likes from much betterlooking girls and I don't even message them cause I feel like they look too good for me and probably swiped the wrong way and I don't want to message them and they ghost me cause they did swipe the wrong way. I know that is the dumbest thing but it's how I really feel. you don't have to comment or say anything I think I really just need to type all this out and post it somewhere.,Depression

18765,I have a really low mood 23 days a week suicidal thoughts real struggle to get through the day I have social anxiety which I am fairly sure causes this.

I do not mean to offend anyone who is suffering 247 I know I am lucky to have those few days where I am kind of ok Is this depression?,Depression
11911,The last couple of months has been hard for me mentally. I was always a fully motivated and positive person with a never give up and cando attitude who was treated as a role model by my peers. I supported many friends when they had hardships yet when my world is crumbling I feel left alone. I read articles on how to deal with my depression regain control and stay positive yet during days like this I am unable to do anything just staying idle in this weird state of being empty which is frustrating. So far every time I have had this state I just tried to survive this mood until the next day or a better moment however recently I feel like I am running out of energy to do so. I am slowly tired of trying and failing again. I just need to share my problems with someone else but not related to me so I would not feel embarrassed showing my weaknesses. Even drunk I am not able to open up trying to maintain the perception of me being strong and firm. I am 26. 6 years in a relationship last 9 months I spent abroad doing my MSc hence my longdistance relationship drifted apart which probably is the main because of my anxiety and lack of control. It was always my safe haven which now is sinking. We made plans that in septoct this year we will graduate and relocate to a different country be engaged and start building our own family. Now my gf is not sure if she still wants to be with me does not see me as a future husband and lost her love. We decided to try and rebuild this bond but it causes me a lot of stress and anxiety when she is wavering while I am doing my best. it is killing me that I cannot do anything but wait and be patient. I struggle with my dissertation topic because I just do not feel it. I hate the research and academic way. I would like to make something practical instead of just referencing existing research and doing interviews... I am running of time yet my supervisor is not helping me instead he put more pressure on me that it is my fault and others are doing great...BSc in engineering MSc in Managemet a lot of academic experience but lack of real working experience just side jobs which are not related volunteering etc. and I wasted some of my time just having fun with friends games and so on. Now I am keep being rejected even though I do my best with my CV personalised cover letters and assessment tests... I wish to finally start my career to be fully independent from my parents but since COVID19 and being MSc student I did not have a real chance to get a job. Next month I will go to a warehouse as in the past mentioned sidejobs but it is frustrating that I am a talented person career advisor is saying I am fine while I am still being dependent and unemployed... Due to being abroad my old friends turned away from me having their new friends work families etc. Meanwhile my parents are telling me that I should be strong and my depression and problems are exaggerated. Basically they ignored my feelings. I feel a little bit better now saying this out loud thanks! although I know it will not change anything in a long term... I am losing control over my life which slowly pushes me to suicidal thoughts.,Depression
21567,Stuck in my own head recently so I just think and I think and I think. Just end up talking to myself about myself for hours days even. One of the thoughts I had tonight was a theory about why I feel the need to do certain things.I have struggled with certain addictions in the past. I put that in quotes because I do not know if some of them wereare actual addictions or if I have just been conditioned to think that in before some days something about the first step is admitting it blah blah blah I get it this is probably what an actual addict would claim. My self harming I would say was probably an addiction from what I can tell. My alcoholism on the other hand I do not know if that was an addiction. The only real friend I have ever had was the one who encouraged me to stop drinking after she found out about my suicide attempt where I drank a full bottle of bourbon cut myself all up my arm and took a box of sleeping pills. I never meant to tell her but she heard about it it the next day through some crazy circumstances long story and we talked about it a little bit and she told me she wanted me to stop drinking for good reason obviously. But that is why I am not sure if Id say I was addicted to alcohol I did drink a fair bit and this was not the first night Id polished off a whole bottle by myself but I think the main reason I view it as a possible addiction is because she asked me to stop. But most of the time its pretty easy to not drink.But anyway all that aside I am starting to notice that my addictions or whatever you want to call them hard the hardest to resist when I am thinking about having these kind of movie moments. Its kind of hard to explain but its like I just think about the emotional state I am in or some event that is triggered me and I sometimes picture myself in a sort of movie scene something Id imagine you would see if a main character went through what I just did and its the scene that shows them processing that or whatever. An example would be in the show Lucifer when Lucifer is sitting on the beach smoking with his wings on the ground behind him. Or any time BoJack goes on a bender in BoJack Horseman scenes like that. Its like the only way I know how to process my emotions is by creating one of these moments for myself in real life. I have to put on some music and sit on a beach at night with a glass of whiskey in my hand or go to a club and get lost in a drugfuelled montage or stand on the roof of a high rise in the middle of the city and smoke. I do not know why this is.But the urge to create these moments for myself is the main thing that pushes me to want to drink or smoke or do drugs or selfharm. There are just some settings or some feeling that feel wrong without the accompanying vice. Even things like the type of alcohol changes sometimes a straight glass of whiskey neat. Sometimes its beer. Sometimes its vodka straight from the bottle. Other times its cocktails. I do not have a preference of my own only what fits the moment I feel like I need to have.I do not know why I do this. I have thought maybe its because I want people to see me a certain way and maybe it is to some extent but almost every time I do it I am alone. Although I guess in the movies they always start alone and sometimes somebody will walk up to them. I do not know what to do with this information I do not know if its better for me to ignore these urges to create the Hollywood moments even though sometimes they actually make me feel a little better and nothing else helps with that or if I should give into them when they happen take it as a sign that I need to process and allow myself to break my sober streak. Hell I do not even know why I have still got a sober streak the only people that cared about me getting clean are gone now. Guess its just force of habit at this point. Anyways do not know why I decided to post about this but its something I noticed and thought was weird. A theory about why I get some of the impulses I get,Depression

26205,I have been depressed for months now and its starting to feel like its not just a temporary lack of chemicals or whatever. I feel shitty in a way that feels like a perfectly natural response to my life my shortcomings my regrets my stupidity my cowardess. It also feels like a normal response to how shitty random difficult and scary life is. Has anybody been able to overcome this? Is it truly just my distorted view of things right now or is this something that will never get better no matter what I do? Depression or just reality?,Depression

25675,I started making YouTube videos last January. The videos sucked at the time I would click on and then click off my videos and the views would go up Id honestly think I was on to something but then I looked at my watch time duration why is it so low and why is the ratio of views to comments so uneven its crazy. Then it was then I realized I was farming my own views and posting it on my ig story to make it seem to people like I was winning this is the honest truth. After then I decided I do not want to put on act I want to actually succeed make nice content so that people would actually watch so I started making COD VIDEOS they were not anything special but they got some attention by some I mean sometimes 20 sometimes a 100 and sometimes people would actually watch over a minute which is bad but I wanted anything I was good with anything at the moment. But then everything went down hill Id skip school work sometimes to upload a video and it would do terrible as in 2 views 0 views and that broke my soul but! I still did not quit. Now mind you I reached a hundred subs four months after I started in all honesty a lot came from sub for sub. So when I reached a hundred subs I made sure not to do sub for sub ever again as I had wanted to build a fan base on the way to the top! So from the end of may to the end of 2020 I was stuck in the hundreds video after video flopping. At this point its December I got into a huge fight with my brother so he took away everything he bought. But I wanted to succeed on YouTube so badly I spent my last money on new equipment I would drop videos all the time despite having school yet they would still flop but I still kept going. My little brother would break my headset Id buy a new one because I did not want to give up My dad would take away my console Id still hold out hope my videos would floop Id still hold out hope. Now this is March 2021 college semester ends in a month so its hard to uploadgetting less than 20 but still going! now my little brother breaks my tv so there is no way we could play. So I go awhile without uploading but I was gaining subs tremendously the videos of kakarot I had dropped a year prior that flopped when I originally put them out were going crazy reaching thousands of thousands of views I gained a bunch of subs from there and now I am very close to 200 I decided to buy a tv following the end of the semester and grinded out the rest to 200. And ever since I gotTo 200 its been so hard its been a month since I got a video over ten views my little brother keepS breaking my headset and my idiotic self who is chasing this fake vision keepsBuying new equipment in hope that would id someday be big have a huge fan base and entertain people and make their day better. I do not want pity I do not want you to sub I just to know if I should keep going or should I accept its not meant to be Should I accept it or keep going,Depression

14369,I never really enjoyed my life but it was manageable. My father is a royal asshole my mother did not intervene. My behavior was to blame according to them it never occured to them it was a response to their shitty parenting. Of course i was bullied daily which did not stop for about 12 years.In all this i was alone and i broke 8 years ago. Major depression. I was not able to continue my education. I tried working but cannot deal with the pressure. The things I used to love are empty and unfullfilling. I have been to all kinds of therapy but nothing works. By now at least i know what is wrong with me chronic childhood trauma.My last resort is going to a mental hospital but if that fails i just do not know what to do anymore.I am a 26yo man and I feel like i never even started living but only ever survived. it is taken 8 years of my life with no prospect of getting better... I am close to just giving up.,Depression
8874,So I tend to get depressive episodes on a fairly regular basis when I am at optimal mental health I get mild to severe dips like a week before my cycle that then go away within a few days but I have been having some longer than normal ones lately and I have been stuck in that sinking black hole for about two full weeks now. Summers always tend to be worse for me since I start to feel alienated and extremely lonely since I am not in college classes and I am stuck with just my parents and my brother. I struggle making friends and the only people I talk to on a regular basis are all online and live on the opposite end of the continent. I have only really had one irl friend who keeps ghosting me. I am very motivated by being able to experience things with others so this has resulted in a lot of me not doing anything at all.I love my family but they have zero filter and often do not understand that because of my depression and mild anxiety I sometimes do not take jokes very well especially ones targeting things I am already struggling with. And like all family members they love to poke and prod until I snap at them or in rare cases until I start crying. A lot of times their comments will hit me right in the anxiety and I have that moment of I have to change everything about myself so I am perfect. Perfect people do not get made fun of. and it is driven me to actively avoid things I love as well as mental heath topics when they are around. it is always a chore trying to navigate that in the summers. Everything has just been so much worse lately for some reason. there is just this ugly feeling in my chest and that horrible need to just make people hate me so I can justify feeling this way. This is easily the worst I have been mental healthwise in like a year and I am starting to struggle a little and letting the bad thoughts linger. Sorry for the long post. there is a lot going on in my head and my life that I need to parse through I guess. Been A Little Rough Lately,Depression

I am alone most of the day I am to fucked up to work I have panic attacks mid day I chain smoke like crazy and I feel like my life is meaningless.

20720,As a person with depression did you have much awareness during an episode as to how badly you were treating your significant other? My partner has been slowly withdrawing for a few months now we are at the point where the only words spoken to one another are good morning and good night. It is like living with a complete stranger. Prior to this we had always been very close affectionate and in sync. We were not only in love but best friends. I hate using the word 'were' but I really do not know where we stand anymore.Should I be concerned that he seems to be acting relatively 'normal' around his family and friends but completely shuts down when we are alone? He has admitted he is depressed but the fact that I am the only one seeing it makes me think I am the because. He assured me that it was not but I still have some doubt.

47159,I don't know how to cope with my grief I dated someone for over 10 years of my life. My entire 20s. I never loved anyone more. We had a falling out our relationship became toxic and even as we tried to remain friends it didn't work.I cut her off last year at end of januarybeginning of february. I assumed she had moved on and everything and stopped talking to me.Instead...she died. I suspect she took her own life. No one told me. For 13 months I held resentment towards her. I didn't want to be with her but I was upset that she had made our relationship toxic. Instead she was dead. Her family did not tell me. On tuesday her mother called me to tell me the news 13 months later. I am devastated. She did not deserve to die. I am so fucking angry at myself. I knew she was sick I knew she was suicidal and I cut her off anyway. I'm angry at her family for denying me the ability to see her funeral. I'm angry that everyone else got a year to grief together and I am dealing with this loss alone.I didn't message her for an entire year because I was convinced she found someone else and my pride wouldn't allow me to even say hi hope all is well.I feel horrendous.,Depression

40194,tw sui attempt mention of method invalidation take care of yourself before reading i m really really confused because i keep really really invalidating all the time i wanted to die i don t want to call them attempt because they aren t serious i took redacted amount but not a lot of zoloft the first time which is not enough to kill anyone i didn t know that but i wanted to die so that s the closest i think i ve ever gotten to a real attempt but i feel like it s more of an od than an attempt and i m just calling it an attempt based of my ni vete at the time the other two were the same night so i don t even know if i should classify them a separate or not the first the rope wa way too long and the second i didn t tie it correctly and it slipped i didn t try after that but like i never even got a little choked can i even call those attempt i wanted to die but wasn t in any danger these were all year ago and i ve had some therapist say they were attempt but i don t really believe that i wasn t close to dying like my intention i m so ashamed to even call them attempt because they seem so pitiful this past december i feel confident calling my cut a suicidal gesture because if i wasn t chicken i would have gone deeper into the artery i still needed stitch though because i wanted to die but knew that i wouldn t go deep enough so that s not even a true attempt either everyone else i talk to in my life with attempt is like yeah i attempted x amount of time and almost died and had to be in the hospital and i m sitting over here thinking how fucked up is it that i m calling my pitiful gesture attempt when they haven t even come close to having negative consequence it doesn t seem right to me am i just calling them attempt for attention because i want to make people think it wa more severe then it actually wa,Depression
47102,I'm desperate for a friend and to feel loved by someone. I really need a friend. I don't even have a single best friend and I'm desperate to find true love. Please help me. No one responded to my last post. It seems like no one cares about me and my life doesn't matter. Female here just saying,Depression
10251,Need to say something. I am feeling like super panicked at the moment and stressed and tired and I have no one to turn to for help and I am just so worried and alone and just need something good to happen. I feel trapped and I just want someone to notice that I am not okay. God damn my chest is just clenching and I just want to be somewhere else.I wish so much that the people I considered to be my friends cared as much about me as they do not know I care about them and want to spend time with them. Trapped and alone,Depression
17577,Do you forgive them and move on? If so how does one do that? I cannot seem to forgive or forget. Its almost imprinted in my mind and I doubt Ill ever be able to shake it off. I am also conflicted because they are my parents at the end of the day how can I have such resentment towards them for such a long time? For me it comes and goes. I appreciate them but deep down sometimes resentment comes up to touch the surface again. I was beaten on a daily basis when I was little I think the most ridiculous reason for being beaten once was because I bought a 0.50 pencil from the school bookshop without asking for permission. When I came home I got thrashed. I keep asking myself how is it fair that other people got to enjoy their childhood and yet I was physically and emotionally abused so much. I am in my early 20s now and they have toned down a whole lot mainly because of health issues and obviously I am an adult now. Many would say why do not you move out? Why do you even talk to them anymore? Well see this is where I am conflicted because I am not like them nor would I ever want to be like them. Also they are my parents they are not a stranger.I vowed to myself that if I ever choose to have children someday Ill never lay a finger on them and Ill support them throughout. I still recall getting into an argument with my dad recently and he challenged me to do so almost like he was mocking me saying he wants to see if I live up to my word. Anyways I apologise for the sad post I just needed to get my thoughts out of my system. If you have any advice on how to manage or on what to do to maintain a relationship with them. Perhaps even on how to remove oneself from such an environment do tell. How do you come to terms with the abuse you faced as a child at the hands of your parents?,Depression
47901,How does anyone do anything??? I've 25f been going through the most stressful depressive episode i've ever been in and I can hardly get anything done. At best I get maybe 12 hours of work done in the afternoon before I have an anxietystressdepression??? attack and my body decides to just shut down. Literally it's hard for me to move and i'd collapse if i try to stand i can't keep my eyes open and it wears me out to the point that afterwards I just lay there and try to do something low energy like reading until I get up to make sure I at least eat something and spend some time with my parents. I can usually spend a bit more time on work if I'm feeling particularly good or hobbies like music and art if I don't have another attack at night but I'm also only productive for maybe 12 hours before I switch to something low energy again . Really my low energy activity is mostly just reading fiction. Sometimes I'll try to play video games but that's rare nowadays. My therapist knows all of this and we're working on it. Still gotta handle it in the meantime though. I'm not employed right now but I do remote volunteer work that takes probably 710 hours a week. I can get my work done but I feel like im seriously hanging by a thread. I'm also job searching but to be honest I have no idea how I'll hold down a full time job. I'm not sure I can even really hold down a remote part time job truthfully. I've considered at least taking small freelance gigs but it's difficult to get going.I feel like im making a lot of excuses since i use to autopilot pretty well through high school and college but with the intense physical symptoms I have now I feel like my depression is more debilitating than ever. I'm kind of scared that soon I won't be able to manage anything and I'll let my life slip by. Tldr I probably avg 12 hours of productivity work and hobbies a day autopilot isnt working since i have physical symptoms that make it hard to move and leave me dead tired i feel like im making excuses and my depression feels inscreasingly debilitating.Just wondering how you guys manage to get things done or if there's others that may be going through the same struggle.,Depression
26080,they did not die or anything and i actually think they are doing well. they just left me. understandably bc i do not know how to deal with my shit or how to communicate in a healthy way. but like i fucking miss them. and i wish i could reach out but i cannot bc i think they are doing good and i do not want to ruin that. F you C K i miss my best friend.,Depression
12711,It was really weird dream like most of them are tbh but I have never killed myself in a dream before last night. Pretty much all of my dreams are kind of staged like I am sat in front of a screen watching this TV show of the dream that switches between me watching myself on screen from a 3rd person perspective and then me in the fake show in my body like usual. Halfway through though it basically turned into a VR first person shooter game where I was just a floating pair of gloves holding guns and I had to choose whether to spare this random guy or kill him in order to finish the game. Then I suddenly realised I was dreaming and of course I am just like everybody here and I think about suicide all the time have not been happy with life since I was 11 or 12 and am in a nearly constant state of misery. So I took that chance to try and kill myself started with shooting in the side of the head but it did not work. I just took damage because of the stupid I am in a video game thing going in the dream. So I took out a shotgun held it under my chin shot myself and I died.There was this brief moment that lasted no more than a second where I had zero thought going on in my head it was all black and I has absolutely no clue what was happening. Maybe I felt what it was like for a bit but I doubt it. I woke up but it was not one of those things where you jolt awake just before hitting the ground I woke up like normal as if this dream was not extremely fucked up.Killing myself did not feel like a relief like I thought it would. It just felt wrong in some sick way it felt too easy. I have known for a while now that I will probably never kill myself purely because its too much work and I cannot even leave the house or brush my teeth let alone find some method of suicide. Now I know for sure that I will not kill myself. From that moment forward I will just sit in hole suffering with no escape and just let the world pass me by. I have no easy exit anymore so I will have to just deal my shit some other way. Not exactly a better option but I prefer it I think.If you are reading this and you still want to kill yourself suicide is not all you imagine it to be. Just take a moment to think what if I am wrong?. I had a dream last night that I killed myself.,Depression
24307,When I tried to kill myself I ended up in the hospital and it seemed like nobody cared except my parents that were angry on me and later a little violent... Psychiatrist just told my mom that they would have never done such thing to their own mother. Later when I spoke to some people like psychiatrists or other they never seemed to be interested in helping me and most of them thought i guess that my problems were not that bad. I have never gone often to therapy and thought that most of them just found me uninteresting but is not it still their job to help me? . I had this problem in the past too and then developed a way of thinking Nobody really cares and they maybe want me dead but I am also boring them This was when I was 1315 now I am 18.... Anyway this really hurt me and pleaseCan someone tell me how to cope with this? Also there was one person that understood my pain and since then I have been obsessing over them what do I do? Please can someone help so that I do not lose hope completely I could not find anyone's help other than here ' What to do when other people invalidate your problems? It caused me trauma,Depression
23571,you have been at your ropes end ready to end it and still had the strength to climb to get one last shred of help to go to therapy five days a week for months on end just to fall apart again when you are done? Just to feel the same. Just for the same bone to break again. Do you keep trying? How do you keep trying? You already used the last shred of strength you could and now what. When you are alone with just your thoughts you still feel it. Nothing should be wrong with you you worked through your issues right? But you are still here in the dark place. So what do you do now? What do you do when,Depression
9971,I have ended up minamising my past sexual trauma to the point where I am not sure if I even deserve the right to be effected the way I was and still am. Even when people knew it was never given the right amount of care. People just moved on after a week or two and I am still left suffering from it over a year later.it is just got to the point where I am almost convincing myself that I do not have any right to feel how I do. I really wish I was just given the same care that majority of people who go through what I do are.it is not fair man I know this will not leave much room for input but I just want to say it somewhere and to someone,Depression
38692,my house had a flood one day when i wa home alone it wa really scary in the moment water running down the wall and moving faster than i could handle on my own it wasn t terribly bad but damaged our basement floor so my husband and i had to move everything upstairs we waited for insurance to approve the claim and then decided my husband would do the work himself to save some fund before we bought the supply we both got covid thankfully his symptom were minimal but it wa not a fun battle for me i managed to stay out of hospital but i wa sick for month the family friend we contracted covid from died we also experienced another significant family death during this time not covid related my husband then ran into several setback with the flooring all together by the time the basement wa put back together it had been month month of extra furniture box christmas decoration gaming equipment and other junk all over the house in a jumbled mess a good chunk of the month i wa sick grieving slowly recovering and isolated because of lockdown i also lost all my front gardening work by the contractor digging up and water proofing our window well ever since i find my anxiety go through the roof whenever i hear heavy rain i used to find it really soothing but now i start to panic about flooding happening again or just something bad in general i can t focus on anything other than waiting for it to stop anyone else feel this way about storm,Depression
23610,I see an overarching theme here where people are deciding whether or not they want to stay or go. They often decide they want to go but yet cannot bring themselves to do it. I also observe that many here are young so I wanted to add another perspective. everyone is situation is different and I am not here to recommend anything but I can tell you when it comes to living with depression it does not get better with time. Depression is a very selfish and selfcentered disorder. We obsess over ourselves how we have affected others and how we feel. We also obsess over how the people we leave behind would feel with us being gone. We consider those who we have hurt in life but we fail to consider this the countless others we are going to hurt. When I think of all of the pain I could have spared people it becomes overwhelming. The marriages I ruined the relationships the children I brought into the world. You think its painful to disappoint your parents? Failing your children is a pain 100 times worse. Exposing those who love youwhom you are supposed to protectto the addiction abuse the emotional absence and all of the other awful things that come along with depression is horrible. Then you find yourself in a place where you cannot leave because you are a provider and you cannot devastate your children. Its like being in one of those movies where going to hell is being damned to live the same day over and over. And all you have to look forward to is growing old the loss of family members the decline of your health financial struggles and career failures. Yeah things could get better. But if you are wired as badly as we are this is highly unlikely. Not only will things get worse for you but you will ruin the lives of people you have yet to meet some of whom have not yet been born. Consider all of this as you decide whether you want to stay or go. Maybe it will get betterprobably it will not,Depression
23698,Idk where to start haha... I just know that if I do not vent I am going to go insane... I am uhm... I am holding back tears right now and my anxiety is at peak levels so I feel like I am going to puke... I just... God these last few months were so much better for me... I thought I was getting better... I was not constantly flitting between being a numb robot which calmly enjoyed thinking of killing itself and a girl who was always on the verge of tears always anxious and scared shitless of her own thoughts... That was fucking terrible and I... I cannot make it through that again... These last few days... With my dad leaving on a trip and leaving me in charge of mom who is going through an episode rn she has BPD... And my brother who is older to me but just... does not help... I am still recovering... I am not nearly as strong as I used to be... Idk if I can take it... Handling mum in her episode all alone I mean... And my fear and anxiety is only made worse by the fact that everyone is on edge about this trip of dad's and they are taking it out on me... My dad telling me that I am useless while also saying things like I am the only reason he can leave and just making me feel like shit about myself... Like I am not doing enough... I am trying so hard... I swear I am... I am giving it my all... But rn? I cannot do shit like studying... All of my energy is going in pretending that I am not fucking losing it or fine with this whole situation... So when I am not doing things for them I am playing minecraft... Something I find fun and relaxing and therapeutic almost... Just... Whatever! I know it is a fucking waste of time but really dad? Now? You want to tell me that I am wasting time and I will regret it now? When I am already feeling like shit about myself and you know it? Not cool... Fucking give me a break! I am not the perfect daughter you wanted...I am sorry... I just cannot be that... I mean... Who tells their kid who is A just coming out of depression B just expressing her feelings C literally is coming out of depression solely because she followed her therapist's advice to express her feelings instead of bottling them up that she is not allowed to show anger or be upset? Who does that?I wish I was fucking kidding but dad said that... Because it might upset mum... God forbid mum sheds a tear! Me? Pshhh let me cry rivers... Who fucking cares? Oh silently smothering myself with a pillow so no one can hear me cry of course... God forbid MOM hears me and gets upset... Now if you will excuse me... Imma do just that... Go smother myself with a pillow and cry myself to sleep... If you made it this far... Thank you for listening... Seriously... I... I needed to be heard for once... I do not want to go back there again... Please god no... I do not think I will survive...,Depression

19221,I am 20 f and have been struggling with depression and generalized anxiety for as long as I can remember but recently I have gotten to an all time low. I am enrolled in university and everyone around me has some sort of experience in their field at this point while all I have under my belt is a seasonal job at a candy shop from highschool. I feel undeserving of every opportunity handed to me as I have not genuinely had to work for it father was a veteran so my tuition is paid for. My friends are all starting to become financially independent and all I have done is scrape by at school and game all day while feeling sorry for myself. I desperately want a job but the fear of actually having an interview and human interaction after spending so much time alone is so overwhelming to me. I constantly think about the fact that if I cannot handle what is happening right now I would not last a second in the real world and that makes me want to end it all. what is ironic about all of this is that I started pursuing a degree in abnormal psychology so I could help people like me yet I cannot even help myself. I feel like a fraud in my own life,Depression
22278,I feel so numb and emotionless I cannot cry anymore I have forgotten about my life my dreams and what i wanted do and what i want do I live in my comfort zone which I have made in my mind I keep dreaming about the future which does not exist and is never going to happen worry about that future that is in my mindEvery time certain painful emotions come up I just cope by laughing I want to do something about it but I cannot not overthinking is really hard every time I try to stop overthinking it multiples by 4 times I want attention from someone at the same time i do not want it I do not really feel people's empathy for me I am angry of ppl around me maybe its because they are happy which i could not I hate ppl helping me at the same time i want help from someoneWaking up everyday is drag meditation also does not work I am afraid of starting new things and being new me I want to be lazy person I want to be surrounded by unhappiness toxicity that I have been doing this over past 2 yearsRight now I do not care about my life I am numbuni grades friendsfamily i do not care anymore I want to sit inside my room by locking door I do not want to die but I want to sleep foreveronly way I cope is by laughing at a pain I wonder how laughing genuinely feels like.I want to wake up from this long nightmare but I am unable to do so I want to wake up from this nightmare,Depression

12967,Living implies that you are living your life where as surviving is just hanging on. I am so fucking tired of just getting by just hanging on in hopes that one day it will get better. It honestly feels like it cannot I am stuck in a endless cycle and for the life of it I have no idea how to get out. I want to reach out but I hate giving the impression that I cannot hold it together it causes people to act different towards me and I hate it. I just want it to end. Surviving is not living,Depression

15462,I have an auora about be me that just exudes a shitty horrible person. To top it off I am s big loser with zero positive attributes. I am at best mediocre with the few skills I have. I do not contribute anything to society or my friends. My family and kids would not even blink I disappeared. I tell my wife these things and ongoing examples of me getting ignored or walked allover and she really just says oh you are having a good day. There is literally no one that wants to be around me. Well that is me a piece of shit. Just sharing and not wanting any feedback or reasons why I am not. I am a loser I really am a garbage individual.,Depression
37674,i don t know how to communicate all of my thought stay inside me instead of telling them to other people like i should my mind simply won t let me i try i really try sometimes and i have so many of them but they get lost my mind is a endless nightmare of thought of despair and hatred towards myself i feel numb and over emotional at the same time and i dont know what to do i feel like a horrible waste of human space stripped down to my bone by my past and my seemingly dim future,Depression
9786,I have a condition that causes motion sickness and sometimes severe spinning anytime there is too much movement. I tried all sorts of medications physical therapy etc but it barely helps. I have spent nearly 60k in medical costs and I just cannot bear the thought of another appointment. Every venture out of my home feels like an enormous struggle and makes me sick. Even normal household tasks make me sick. So I am stuck here always in the same spot. it is wearing at my sanity. I tried therapy antidepressants but it only made my issues worse. People get depressed seeing me like this and I kind of get pushed out of their lives to spare ruining their day with my reality. I am about to lose my work from home job and may end up out in the elements like this which terrifies me. Doctors do not really seem to care much either. it is not really terminal and there is little they can do so again I get pushed away. I know no one can help me I am just rambling. I just do not know if I will ever reach a point in life where I feel safe and comfortable. I wish I believed in an afterlife. This all really seems pointless and stupid. I rarely leave my home even my room.. because of a disability that steals enjoyment out of fun.,Depression
23376,In the course of this summer I have been a burgeoning drunk began to self harm again been in patient and out patient at a mental institution been put on antidepressants had at least one panic attack a week and have had my PTSD ravage me almost everytime I fall asleep. All of this before my 18th birthday! Yay...See I know I am not going to be able to handle college especially with a randomly assigned room mate and being in a different state from my only family and support system. The problem is I honestly think this is my only chance to go to college relatively debt free. My entire 4 year tuition is paid for by the school and I have enough scholarships and money to be pretty comfortable but if I deny the college all that goes awayexcept for the personal money I guess and I am not sure I can get it back again.I just do not know what to do and everyday I am starting to think that killing myself would be easier for everyone. My family and me included. I mean I either go to school and kill myselfwhich is pretty cheap considering I want to be cremated or I stay home and be a burden on my family for 1yr and I mean a serious burden. My mother already cleaned out her savings account to pay for my hospitalization and that was not even enough to pay all of it. My sister and I have already been taking out hundreds for all of the bills my mother cannot pay right now. I am spiraling and without alcohol I seriously doubt I am going to be alive this August much less go to college.Any advice or comfort or...idk anything?I am so sorry this is so long... I have freshman year of college in August...,Depression
9947,I have been doing so well. Then out of nowhere I am having midday cry sessions for no reason and catch myself laying in bed wondering if I could really do it this time. Why am I this way? How do you get better when you do not know why you are so sad all the time? All the therapy and meds in the world cannot compete with this feeling and I am just so lost.I am exhausted. I am sad. I am alone even though I am surrounded by support. I just cannot stand my own mind. I wish I was someone else. Its Back,Depression
18948,I just feel like my life is going no where. I have burned all the bridges that can be burnt. I treated my mum awful to the point where she did not want me to contact her anymore because of my drug use are relationship is better now but now she is hospitalised with cancer. I do not have any friends although I guess I do not really try. I have been with a couple girls but have never had a long term relationship. I feel like a P.O.S. Feeling low,Depression
9348,I have been having a tough time the last couple years but for a lot of that time I was covering up my depression with drug use. Since I got clean I just cannot seem to find motivation to do much of anything. Things were worse in the last couple months as I struggled with housing stability but even now I can barely push myself to leave my room or my bed. I know that my seratonin rewards system is fucked up right now due to the chemicals I was putting in and I have an appointment nexr month for a pharma referral for antidepressants. I am hoping when I leave my sublet next week for a more permanent spot and can unload my storage unit I can get back to more normal living since I will at least have more than just the one or two outfits I have been living in. I am not sure what my purpose is of this rant I just do not know what to do with my life. I am grateful I have got a little savings and unemployment payments for the next few months because I do not have much for family support apart from a phone call here and there and I am not sure where I will go moving forward. I have a meeting at my union apprenticeship next month but I am not too eager to go back to 62 construction and waking up at 430. I am 37 and just feel like a fuckup with little prospects for my future. I do not want to kill myself but I definitely have had fantasies that I just do not exist so I do not have to shoulder the burdens of life. it is stupid but I also have this fantasy that I will win one of the million vaccination giveaways coming up this month and it will solve all my problems. I am sure it would not and I would just have new problems in addition to barely being able to leave my room but the financial stability would certainly help. Struggling with finding meaning desire for more in life,Depression
21953,I have taken valdoxan Zoloft and paxil in the past and had no effects or side effects no improvement of mood worse or better. Thus time I started Zoloft again a different brand since June 1st and am not feeling better or worse but have a lot of side effects anxiety attacks and worst is the extreme fatigue. I do not have energy to be upbeat which I actually am sometimes though depressed. I do not get out of bed and do not cook at all. I prefer how I was before I think I can manage my depression and mood swings but I wanted to try one more time since I am going on vacation.My doctor appointment is not till October but I am 90 wanting to taper off this and stop taking it. Should I wait a little longer for my energy to return or start tapering off my prescription now? Antidepressants SSRI seem to not help me but is it too soon? Useless antidepressants,Depression
9907,My parents are on vacation at the moment and its just me and my older sister home.I had my girlfriend over and we had sex talked and watch a movie. I asked my sister yesterday if she could have slept over and she said no I know it was selfish and wrong of me to still take her home with me but I just wanted 1 day just 1 day of not feeling terrible of just being myself.I have religious parents and just a religious family in general. I do not believe in anything and accept how they are and what they believe in but they still want me to be a certain way. I still remember when I was 16 years old and told my dad that I liked a girl and my mom and dads response was you do not know what love is and you are not allowed to be with anyone. I feel so fucking different from my family and I know it was selfish of me but yesterday was the one day I felt some resemblance of joy I am 20 years old and I have been spending my whole life miserable and I have not been allowed to be myself and I just hate who I am because of what my family expects from me. My sister and my girlfriend kind of got into a bit of an argument because of it. I have never felt this way about anyone and yet still I have a hard time pursuing happiness. I have not eaten today and just laid in bed all day.I do not know why I am so different from the rest of my family we all grew up the same way but I still ended up so different from my siblings and my whole family.Like I said I know it was selfish of me but I just wanted 1 day of feeling different 1 day of getting some rest and to just try and be happy instead of miserable. I do not know what is wrong with me and I am even sorry for writing this and venting about it maybe I do not even deserve it. I did something too make me happy and it only caused pain. I guess I am just constantly going to feel isolated from my family.,Depression

9411,Apart from my mom and teachers.Yes. Not even Hello OR a 10 second conversation. Nothing. To me girls are more of a mythological being than something that actually exists in reality.Also I have been bullied mercilessly by everyone my whole life zero respect when it comes to pretty much everything. Example what recently happened I went to a hairdresser and I said I want her to cut it to medium lenght then she proceeded to cut it almost bald and said men are supposed to have short hair. Now Imagine this kind of bullshit every single time you engage with someone in a conversation. Since I do not have anyone to talk to I started to daydream a lot it is called maladaptive daydreaming and I do it 15 hours everyday depending on how much I sleep. And also I talk to myself all the time because like I said I have nobody to talk to. But at the same time I do not want to be with anyone because I took umbrage against the whole society for treating me the way they did and I do not think it is ok for me to be accept anyone in my life even if someone wants to be my friend Which is impossible. I have not talked to a female in 6 years.,Depression
39227,this is an embarrassing confession to make but i feel like this is the only place i can seriously get advice i m a year old guy who ha already had awful anxiety around year ago when i wa young my mum wa super supportive about it and took me to therapy which seriously helped me for a while and i still absolutely love her for that after my therapy session finished i wa having the best period of my life i wa seeing and meeting new people and getting close with others but year ago my anxiety started coming back and a big part of my anxiety that i didn t tell my mum wa the fact i needed to poop during my attack it sound silly i know haha now school is a nightmare because i m scared to go in school due to it s small size and the fact that there is a very small amount of bathroom in the school i always have the feeling of what if it finally happens for reference i have never had an accident in school but have sure a hell came close i will also cancel plan with friend outside of school if i couldn t get it all out before we leave i ve left job because of this fear a well and i just feel like an absolute loser my mum doesn t like me staying off from school in any way and i feel i cant tell her this reason because it is genuinely embarrassing and she would believe i m lying i also want to get back on therapy but i don t want to break her heart after she wa so proud of me the first time and even cried for me my mum is a god send and i love her with all that is in me so i can t tell her that it back again i think i need med but i ve never been diagnosed so i don t know this sound absolutely ridiculous i know but it s something i ve been seriously struggling with and am typing this right now with diarrhoea the night before school terrified if anyone ha any similar experience and how they overcame this it would help me in way you can t imagine thank you,Depression
17247,I have been battling constant suicidal thoughts in the last month hopelessness I even started seld harming. Suddenly my mother who previously had a downplaying attitude to it changed and now she started listening to me and caring about me. I finally vented out all my anger and suffering.Now I am not really feeling better rather feeling numb and isolated. Maybe Its a bit better since I do not think about suicide that much or self harm but I am basically just on autopilot. I sit down in front of the computer once I gathered the energy to get out of bed and keep playing or watch youtube all day long. I do not even have time to think about anything I honestly do not know how I am feeling.Is this a normal part of depression? Maybe I was stupid and faking depression somehow id this should not be like this? I am so fucking confused about my feeling and thoughts I just want to flow away Does this mean something? Feeling super numb,Depression

18596,Its been almost 7 years since I last saw my mom when I was 13 and I always missed her now at 22 I was with a terrible job and living alone and when I wanted to call her she was always busy or talked in a really quiet voice. After a year of her dating her boyfriend she decided to tell me to ask for my opinion I honestly did not really care but instead I told her that I was okay with it. After a couple months I asked her if I could go live with because I missed her I honestly missed her. When I arrived she cried for maybe 5 seconds and gave an awkward hug her boyfriend is nice and so are his kids so I thought It would be fine and it was obvious he likes my mom a lot so I was happy. She started saying that she wanted to make up for the years I was not with her so she started buying whatever I wanted but that lasted only for maybe 2 or 3 months. Then it was the issue with the two kids they were nice and I got along with them really quick but then we started to clash on some things. The older one lies a lot to everybody he tells you one thing and tells another to someone else and the younger one wants to be in everybodys business wants to know what everybody is doing. I started thinking that maybe I did not tolerated them anymore since they seem pretty close to my mom and I was jealousbecause of some videos that they showed me I realized they only started calling her mom the moment they heard me say it since they called her godmother before. But my mom told me that she also saw how they were and she did not really believed them when they told her they loved her. Then the parents of her boyfriend came to visit along with their daughter in law. My mom became preoccupied with treat them well and show them she was not like his ex wife she literally left the kids and her husband for another and took everything with her but my mom started saying she was worried that the daughter in law was going to say something bad to me and told me to stay in my room and not leave she also said that I could not go with them outside since we did not fit in the car. I talked to her about what annoyed me about the two kids and that I did not want to stay in the room all day she made a face and told me how inconsiderate I was and that I never helped with anything. She always told me that I could tell her anything but she always told me that I was fighting over nothing that why could I be more understanding. So I stopped saying anything to her and when she realized that I was mad and did not tell her why she asks why and tells me that I can always tell her everything. Now I started thinking that it would be better to just go back to living alone. I just do not know what to do I am so tired maybe because is not only the two of us anymore. Sometimes I am glad she does not pay that much attention to me anymore because if she did she would know how bad I am at studying or being responsible. My Mom and her new family sorry for the rant but I do not have anybody to talk about this,Depression

20495,I have been struggling with depression and anxiety since I was 9 years old. Ever since my dad passed away its been like a rolling snowball effect. I have been trying to get my mom to help me find help for it but she insists that there is nothing wrong with me and I am just sad every once in a while. Therapy is extremely expensive where I live and I do not know if my insurance will cover it. I have been trying to distract myself with two full time jobs as well as full time classes in University hoping that Ill be able t just run away from the feeling if that makes sense. Does anyone have any advice on how to convince my mom to help me? I do not know what to do. What do I do?,Depression

24831,I would have liked to consider myself as someone who recovered like someone battling cancer or other similar diseases. Like its been 6 years now can I say that I do not have major depressive disorder anymore? what is damning about mental health is that its closer to an ongoing process closer to what you might see in recovering addicts. I am having my first major relapse depressive period in almost 6 years. My initial depression was something I did not recognize something I was not consciously aware of. Honestly I did not know of another way of thinking that long ago and thought my life would always be like this Id always feel like this.. its a miracle I lived as long as I have. With the help of a counselor who was able to change my perspective a psychiatrist and developing a support system I was able to overcome the lowest of my depression and finally feel. normal?Now I know what both feels like. What is normal and what is abnormal. I have had some small bumps and up and downs throughout time but nothing major. I was always self aware enough of what negative patterns start to lead me to a downward spiral. I have maintained medication and selfcare habits to keep me from the edge. Right now I am in a major depressive episode. I do not know what happened. All of the sudden I was thinking of killing myself again. It first started actively thinking of ways to off myself. I could not think of anything else. Then those thoughts started to think in the background. I was grocery shopping looking at fruits and trying to think if I wanted an apple then I was hoping that something would happen and kill me there. Its this weird disconnect where I feel so self aware of these thoughts unlike before. Like I know I am moving slowly. I have to think about the next step on refilling water than just doing the entire process fluidly open lid think next step ok put lid on side ok what is next . When I sit and stare at a blank wall part of me wants to laugh because I know what is happening but I cannot stop. I am still self aware mentally but my body cannot take the action to start moving. I know its the symptoms of my depression and I want to laugh everytime I notice it because hey its there and I know it is but it will not go away and its making me do weird things like staring at blank walls for 12 hours. Another thing I have noticed is when I talk to other people its not a seamless experience of reacting to emotions and providing nonverbal cues with verbal responses. I am taking in the information putting everything I have into listening then I have to think about what you said then decide how I should act. Like I am thinking about whether to frown or how to show concern on my face then I can finally maybe think of something to say. Its like this very unnatural experience to try and stay normal. Sleeping regularly is something that I used to take pride in. Now I cannot sleep until the sun rises but then to try and correct my sleep Ill wake up 3 hours later. Ill feel so tired both physically and mentally until about 10pm when I finally feel ready to accomplish a small task. From 9am10pm I spend my time trying to gather some form of strength to move to accomplish something to do dishes or laundry or really anything. Now that I am not a teen or young adult anymore and as someone who now has a career and a job where other people need me well its not going good to say the least. there is no real end to this because there is no end and I am currently suffering from an depressive episode. I feel close to a crisis but also feel too aware and cannot just let things be like this. I guess to end this would be some advice or help? I am in so deep that doing simple things take 10 hours before I can do it. I try to think of things I used to enjoy doing but cannot even fathom any enjoyment in them I.e. hiking right now its just a lot of effort to look at some effing shrubs and trees. What were the small things you have done to pull yourself out? Thinking of taking medical leave and seeing my psychiatrist seem like an impossibility daunting task right now. Relapse ramble amp support?,Depression
14712,Basically my friend has been ignoring me for weeks. Then out of nowhere he messaged me and explained to me that I am a shit person and said it was not my fault because its just who I am. The thing is I felt nothing when he said that absolutely nothing. All I feel is boredom and nothing in my life I find no enjoyment in anything. And my losing my friend and feeling nothing just makes me think I am a shit person. My friend just told me I am shit person.,Depression

22871,Trigger warning anxiety depression and suicidal thoughtsI have struggled with depression and anxiety all of my life. But a few months ago I did a 6 week group therapy course and I was feeling much better. I started slimming world I started going to the gym I just started enjoying life again. I have to have hormone injections every month to put me through menopause at age 29 and soon I will be having surgery to remove my final ovary because of endometriosis. The last 4 weeks or so I have felt absolutely amazing I have had a positive outlook on life I have been going out and doing things and actually having a life. Then I realized last week that I had missed my previous hormone injection I do not know how long for. So last week I went to the doctors and had it done and since then the darkness has been rolling in and slowly suffocating me. And now I am terrified that when I have my surgery I will be in this dark place constantly because I will be menopausal and because of my health issues I cannot take HRT. I have pain in my chest I am constantly fighting panic attacks I am not bathing or even changing my clothes some days. I am trying to eat right so that I can hold on to something that has made me happy but the urge to binge eat is constant. I am fighting it but it is just so hard.I have to walk my dog once a day and I am sat here paralyzed by anxiety not wanting to leave the house. Like there is something pinning me in place. I want to cry all the time I am picking fights with my husband over trivial things. I just feel like I am drowning.I want to speak to my doctor about changing my medications but I am too scared to pick up the phone. Plus even if I could I sleep 12 hours a night and I often miss the chance to even make an appointment.I have been suicidal in the past when the darkness takes over and I am not there yet but I am terrified it is just around the corner. I am struggling with my mental health and do not know what to do,Depression
25756,How pathetic you have to be that you vent on a reddit post instead of getting your shit together. I have not had any sense of motivation for years now no selfesteem for even longer. I cannot see a future were I make it no girlfriend no academic success no healthy relationship with my parents my friends are seemingly avoiding me. The only things I have are the funny video games that distract me and do not letting any emotion out of myself. I am going to die alone and it is all my fault. This unlovable piece of shit is going to kill itself. All my fault. With the only things leaving behind being a suicide note and a void on the people I knew that they do not deserve but fuck it what is even the point on continuing with my life I cannot see myself being a normal functioning fucking human being maybe then you will tell her how you feel you coward piece of shit fucking stupid useless idiot waste of resources. Oh hey it is me venting to randos on the internet,Depression
15322,Almost every friend I have ever made has free roam of my life and can come and go as they pleasebut its funny how every single friend wants to stay out of my life. Ill let them for their happiness if not for mine. Ill respond accordingly to their messages to me but heh when is that ever going to happen? Technically I have not cut anyone out of my life.,Depression
7912,I am about to turn 18 and I am not ready. I never planned on getting this far living this long. That selfish desire to end it all is still there but I am too afraid to do it. I look back at 15 year old me feeling almost the exact same way and wish I would had the guts to do it then. If I had not taken years to dwell on it years in which I have acheived absolutely nothing done absolutely nothing I might have been able to rest and find peace so much sooner. I felt like I have not slept in years my relationship with food is only more horrendous and the only thing that forces me outside is an exercise addiction. Whatever momentary happiness I might feel when I watch a good film or see a fox in the evening does not make any of this worth it. I have not felt true joy in so long I do not think I even remember what it means to actually enjoy life.I have completely wasted my teenage years. I have spent them inside for the most part isolating myself from people and trying to sort myself out on my own. I cut people off and other people got bored and left and now my only good friends live thousands of miles away and I will probably never even get to meet them. I know this is my fault and I should have tried harder to connect with people but I just could not. It felt impossible to hold onto those who mattered. Now I watch them all on Instagram going about their lives and having a great time and I am so happy for them but I am also so selfishly jealous. That happiness they have is all I have ever wanted. If I could throw away everything I have but be free from mental illness I would do it in a heartbeat. I am so exhausted. I do not even know what I am doing anymore. I am about to turn 18 and I have wasted my teenage years,Depression
19846,I do not know where else to express this and honestly I do not want to. I have a long history of anxiety amp depression I am 26 now. I have had it for over 15 years. I always try to plan convince myself that it is over but it always comes back with the circumstances. I am currently living my with grandparents and my family one home loads of chaos. we are here until our home renovations are done which would take another 4 weeks to be fully done. I have been anxious ever since because it is a toxic environment and I have not been able to form any sort of routines or habits whatsoever. It is slowly killing me. I am in the process of applying for graduate schools and this is certainly not helping. I have been a pillar of support for other people but nobody stands up for me. I do not have any actionable advice to work on and I am pretty sure that therapy will not help me. The only thing I have decided for now is work on 3 things per day and I will do them at any cost. I figured that once I move back home I can start establishing my habits bit by bit. The problem is if I take it slow I get the FOMO and if I do not I get overwhelmed. I am feeling super alone right now and fighting this feels so exhausting. I wish I had someone to talk to about this. I wish I had a friend. This even makes me suicidal but one minute at a time I guess. I feel like I am slipping through the cracks again.,Depression

12122,Hey everyone. My girlfriend and i began dating about a year and half ago after meeting on tinder a few months prior. We were both each others first ever relationship. I was a senior in college she was a junior at the time. Everything started off so well to the point where we both felt like the stars aligned for us. We clicked almost instantly. I would come see her every weekend about an hour away at her college and she would do the same for me. We both looked forward to the fact that even tho we were long distance we always had a date when we could meet. When we were not jn college she lived about 5 hours away. that is when things got tough but we always seemed to overcome every obstacle that faced us. Everything seemed right when we were together almost like a fairytale. We talked about our future the thinks we wanted to accomplish in life and everything in between. We opened up to eachother in ways we never have for anyone else. She eventually talked to me about how she is struggled with depression ever since freshman year of college. Over the past 4 months or so i began to really see it. She never seemed happy anymore she was about to graduate from college along with other things such as finding a job and just moving on to a new chapter in her life. The things she used to enjoy she no longer cared about. She opened up to me about how she feels like i deserve better and she cannot hell the way she treats me. she is come to the conclusion that if we ever broke up i would realize how toxic she was and that i would find someone better than her easily. I have always assured her that I have never felt that way and she is everything I have ever wanted. she is just incapable of seeing it that way. Its clear that she does not love herself so its hard for her to love me back the way she thinks i deserve. Truth is id do anything for her and i want to do what is best for her to. We have not seen eachother in 2 months since she graduated but she plans on coming over next week. untill then we just decided to take a break. am i being foolish to believe that depression has taken her over to the point where she feels the way she does? I am holding on to the idea that once she does find her self again that she will find her love for me again. Depressed girlfriend advice,Depression

10153,I have depression and general anxiety and need a job that does not leave me by myself the whole time but is also not too fast paced and stressful that I get overwhelmed. It kind of seems like to me that when you ask for both of those things they do not really combine I would rather not be doing mindless tasks as they really let my mind wonder making me kind of sucidal and dissociate. I am just so stumped on what to do. I want to get back out on the world and start living again but I do not know how to work around my depression and anxiety. Therapy and Medication has not worked so I need to do the best I can to at least get to a basic level of functioning again. I guess it is also worth mentioning that I am 19 and have like 0 interest in any field at all. I am really just looking for something I can get started on right nowHelp is really appreciated! cannot find a job that fits both depression and anxiety. Feeling stuck and need some suggestions please!!,Depression

11022,Me 24M My Partner 29F I have undiagnosed anxiety at least I think I do. Whatever it is its taken a toll and ruined most of the romantic relationships I have been in. And its rearing its ugly head again or I am. I am trying not to place the blame on the anxiety I need to own itI have been obsessively checking my partners location using Find My even when I know where she is work home sisters etc It occurred to me recently What would I do if she was not where she said she was? It always worries me when she or my past partners would go out for the night to hang out with friends and have a few drinks. I get this overwhelming feeling that they are going to find someone better bring them home and be unfaithful just the thought of it makes my stomach turn. I want to be able to tell myself that is not likely and get out of my own head but Its all I can think about. It does not help that my current partner is Bipolar 2 and has manic episodes where her sex drive is elevated that scares me even more. What if she needs to scratch that itch and I am not around? What if she is mad at me and does it to get back at me? What if this? What if that? Its a deep rabbit hole. To pile on the crap she works retail and I have an office job so there is several hours every night that I try to keep myself busy and not imagine her sneaking off from work to be with someone else. Speaking of work she is fairly new at this job in a management position and they are already talking about moving her to a new store possibly out of state as the next step career wise. Now this is not for a few years but I have got obligations here that make it more challenging for me to pack up and move to a new state if that is what happens. She she just has me and lately its felt like she would be willing to drop me like a sack of potatoes should the offer come up.Its been a recurring argument we never have time for just us you are always on about workJust be present with me they call you in every day even on your days off its taxing to say the least. We talked recently and it came up that our priorities are out of order Hers are 1. Her career 2. My Career 3. Our relationship Mine are 1. Our relationship 2. Our careers It just feels like she is not willing to compromise at all. I have asked her multiple times if she would be willing to but its always I do not know what my plan is yet I do not want her to give up her future for me but I do not want to be considered when she thinks about her future that does not seem crazy right? The icing on the cake is I have developed a little bit of a weed addiction. Problem is I work for Uncle Sam. And also I act like such a child when I am high. I try not to I try to be chill like everyone else but when I am high is the only time I feel like I can not worry about everything else.So yeah I act like a child when I am high because the rest of the time I have to hold everything together and its this sweet sweet release from that. I do not know what the point of this rant is is it a confession is it a rant I just want to be heard validated maybe. What does it look like from the outside?Ask questions for clarification if you want. I feel like my anxiety is ruining my life,Depression
14248,I have a fear of going crazy. I had a huge panic attack when I was about to kill myself last year and everything felt unreal and I felt crazy.

27221,I was diagnosed with severe depression when I was about 13 years old and I am now 21. For the majority of the past 8 years I never really struggled with showering or brushing my teeth etc. however over the past year I have been severely struggling with caring for myself. COVID had just started taking over the world and I found out that my family was moving to a different city... I think both of those things really messed me up. I stopped caring about my diet and gained a bunch of weight I am working on losing that weight now which will hopefully improve some things for me i feel like I do not have the energy to clean myself and I just feel like shit all the time. In 2019 I was the happiest I have ever been I loved the way I looked I loved the way I treated myself and how I could do things for myself I got into an awesome relationship and things were just amazing. Now I can barely step outside my apartment and just stay in bed all day. After a year of being stuck like this and reflecting on my past I am ready to start pulling myself out of this slump and try to get things backs on track for myself. I am open to any advice or helpful tips!!! I struggle to care for myself,Depression
12730,So I am 19 male and am having a really shit day today even for me I work as a carer and my favourite client died today and he was only fcking 50 in addition to that my gf left me 2 days ago and I cannot for the life of me understand how people are happy god knows I have tried. I have been diagnosed with depression for two years and have a CBT therapist and on antidepressants. And they have seemed to have helped a bit but like the world is shit. As I am writing this people have died been SA ect... and most of the things wrong with the world I cannot do anything about like the fact millions of young girls do not have access to school or young trans people are being beaten up for no reason other than the fact their trans. So yeah that is my hot take the the day .So is the world shit? Or am I being melodramatic . Thanks sorry I rambled The world is a shit place TW,Depression
19447,Ever since I have moved out 6 months ago I have been feeling worse than ever. Every day I wake up kind of feeling like shit and I do not know and sometimes even want to do anything about it. Has anyone got any advice on what I should do? I do not think I am depressed but I just do not like everything right now Feeling a bit sad,Depression
17410,the worst part is i cannot even tell if I am faking it or not. it does not feel fake idk. i broke up with my ex girlfriend several days ago because her mental health was starting to affect mine and we did not have a healthy relationship. its just when you love someone so much that its hard to see them like that. but throughout our relationship i found my self in really depressive states and when she was contemplating suicide i did too and that started to give me suicidal thoughts and they have not gone away. i do not think i would ever do it i want to live. but what this relationship has done to me is mentally and physically drained me. i know I am not the only one who is drained but right now how I am feeling is that the future is useless. i know how its going to end. I am going to meet someone new fall in love get a dream job get some cats maybe but is it really worth it? because i cannot even explain what the next few days are going to be like my last relationship has made me highly depressed and a bit suicidal,Depression
38209,i m so tired everything is rough right now i m getting sick of it and i want out it seems thing go wrong at every turn lately for example my family went on a big march break trip one week on a resort wa gon na be awesome to top it off i wa turning sixteen that week and guess what happens i get norovirus for day and then the flu for the rest of it i missed half of the trip how fucking incredible back home now and thing are more stressful than when i left the ceiling of my parent restaurant caved in from prolonged water damage which our landlord wouldn t fix and we ve been closed for a month now with repair only starting recently i have been unable to work this whole time which is lovely considering i am paying of an expensive computer feel selfish to complain considering the scale of issue that my parent are facing but still fucking suck i can barely get myself out of bed in the morning now and i ve missed lot of school a a result of course my grade have fallen i ve got missing assignment littered about and it suck cause not long ago i wa a 90 and up student i just want to be dead i m not brave enough to do anything though so i guess i ll sit and suffer i wa hoping i d have turned all this around by it s been year that this ha been going on now and i am so disappointed in myself for it i know i could do better than this i know i have the capability if i could just have enough energy and will to get the fuck out of bed every morning all would be perfect if i could look at myself in the mirror without wanting to claw my face off all would be perfect but none of this is gon na happen because i don t have the drive to bother with any of it nobody know either i don t think anybody ha the slightest clue and if they have an idea they don t know the depth of it i m not gon na tell them i ll probably have died already by the time i have the courage to say anything oh well i certainly won t tell my parent i don t even know how we are still afloat financially with everything that s happening but we are barely and i m not gon na add stress to them,Depression
11171,Okay so I have been fluctuating between 100150mg doses of Pristiq desvenlafaxine for 6 or so years and I have been tapering down with my doctor for three months. I am down to 50mg every second day and I cannot believe the amount of rage and anger I feel at the moment. I want to smash things shout at people ram their car etc etc for no reason and I know behaving that my way is not okay and I have no intent to follow through but I have no idea what to do with all this anger beyond take some Seroquel and have a nap. Has anyone else experienced this? How diddo you cope? I belted the shit out of my cars steering wheel today and cried afterwards because I dented the logo plate in the middle of it so that is not productive. I hope this is just a withdrawal symptom and not part ofMe the Pristiq had been masking. SNRI Antidepressant Withdrawals,Depression
16993,I am in my early 20s it seems like all people around me are extremely happy have a functional family a solid economic floor great friends a ideal relationship and they are living life like a fantasy. Why those people are happy and they have stability in all aspects of life?My soul at this age is consumed literally... I do not have social life since 7 years and get used to stay alone long periods of time in my room the weirdest part is that I reached such level that I do not use my voice anymore I prefer communicate in my own house with signs silence pact.I spend 68 hours everyday studying until burnout because I am pissed off I will not stop until complete my goal because this is the only thing that root me in the real world. My rage and deception of life is such deep that I suppressed my emotions years ago I converted my depression into pure angry 247 it is my only gasoline to continue my day forcing my brain to collapse to get a decent job and leave this hell called home. The problem now is that I am very furious and I contain all of this without leaving my mind I would like to punch a sand bag to reduce my stress.Right now you are reading this and you could see me but I am not here my mind left me years ago one day maybe Ill return when the things be better... for now I have to continue in this automatic strict routine. I would like to have friends to feel something but idk... I became a coldserious person. Today I make 7 years with depression try me bich.,Depression
14927,I am 22m. Been anxious af all my life. I am at a point where I honestly do not want to live as me anymore. I do not see a way out. Its bad enough to be temperamentally extremely anxious but combined with being extremely ugly and short AND now balding at 22. How the fuck am I supposed to deal with all of this. I feel intense shame about being me. Its pathetic not being able to just look your boss in the eyes and have a normal conversation. I have no chance of having a normal life like this. I honestly just want to disappear. Cease existence. I cannot walk to the fucking busstop without shaking with anxiety. I used to have dreams. I do not know man. I feel like such a bitch writing here like this. But I do not know what else to do. I cannot suicide because it would affect a lot of people around me. So I am just stuck. Endure untill death. Someone please explain to me how can I have a healthy selfimage when my face is deformed and I look 50 years old while being 22. AND I cannot be normal around people due to my anxiety. Like where do I even begin... Anxiety killing me slowly,Depression
17028,Any job I get I end up working with people who scream at me and bully me until I am forced to leave. I cannot win a freaking crane game and wasted 400. I did not win anything. Oh yeah I do not have a job. cannot get one of those either even after 300 applications.Tagged along with my parents on vacation and it rained every single day the whole entire week. Guess who gets to drive home 2 hours in torrential rainfall and flooding? Me!Any relationship I ever had people leave friends or boyfriends People dump me and never speak to me again yet I do not do anything bad to anyone. No one even tells me the reason they up and leave.So nothing in life works out yes I put in loads of effort I feel like I am swimming against a dangerous current kicking thrashing trying to fight and make progress but I am not getting anywhere. I have no one to help me no one to throw me a life preserver. I obviously have no luck whatsoever other than I do not have cancer but that is probably not far in the future.I just feel so pathetic. I feel like so many other people are skating through life and yeah they all have their problems but come on is not my case pretty extreme? Over 300 job applications and no job? 400 on crane games and not 1 prize? Do I just SUCK at life? Seriously? Am I cursed? Funny one time when I was little I thought I had an encounter with the devil no one believes me and I understand unless it was a dream but how do I remember it so vividly all these years? I hate it all. I want it to end because I am so TIRED. I am tired of trying so hard for so many years and never accomplishing anything. I feel like I try harder than most people who actually succeed. Yet I am just a freaking reject loser pathetic waste. No luck in life nothing works out,Depression

26269,I look at old photos of me and I cannot remember or seem to imagine that was me. I was happy and I did not even realize it. I have been through a lot throughout my life19F. I feel like everything changed three years ago. I used to have so much fun with my family and friends. Now I did not seem to have any fun in doing the things I used to do. Mind you I had a toxic relationship and maybe that contributed to me becoming a different person. I also dealt with a toxic job and problems with school. I got pregnant twice finishing high school but I chose to abort because of my personal issues. My dad cheated on my mom and abandoned my family so I no longer have any contact with him. I do not talk to my high school friends anymore either. I am now single lonely and scarred for life. I feel like I have an eating disorder anxiety and depression. I feel like if I am trapped in a black hole and I cannot get out. I feel like I am not shining anymore like how I used to. I feel gloomy and I know this is not me. I always see everyone my age on social media partying and having fun with their friends and it makes me sad. I know my life is not over yet but I feel like there is no point in anything anymore. I stopped working and going to college too. I wish I could change my mistakes I made in the past and maybe my life could be different right now. I feel like I am not myself anymore,Depression

12716,Hello guys I am not even sure if this is the right subreddit for this and sorry for my english in advance but i wanted to tell you how unusual I have felt since 2 days ago. Basically since I woke up on Tuesday I have been feeling numb like there is a fog in my brain and i lost interest for activities I normally do and really enjoy like watching movies.The weirdest thing about it is that I have irrational thoughts about it like literally 3 days ago i was watching old obscure essay films and literally the next day I found myself thinking what is the point of movies? they are fake those are actors and I cannot wrap my head around this.Added to the fact that I have constantly felt tired and sleepy I naturally thought about depression or anxiety but i have never had any of those things before in fact I am usually the cheerup guy in the family and usually find the silver lining even out of the most dark situations that have happened so it is being very sudden and unexplainable nothing has happened in my personal life lately either to justify this.I also thought it might be a side effect of Nasonex that is a corticosteroid nasal spray I have taken since the 8th of July and I have read it has some side effects but in the instructions it does not say anything about psychological effects so i kind of wrote it off. Then looking online I have read corticosteroids can actually produce anxiety or depression sometimes but it is very rare. So i basically do not know what to believe.Has anything like this happened to you before?Thanks in advance Weird symptoms for the past 2 days,Depression
38731,i m not financially stable enough right now to afford a therapist but my anxiety is really bad and since i m going into university soon i need to get over it really soon can i just do exposure therapy by myself like throw myself out there and just hope for the best and possibly have multiple panic attack,Depression

21661,I grew up poor. Very poor actually. We were never able to travel for breaks or anything. Bologna sandwiches and noodles were common dinners and sometimes it was crackers and water if we were really struggling. One time we even went almost a year without electricity. I am 25 now and obviously I am still struggling with PTSD from those days. Sometimes I convince myself that maybe I would not hate life so much if I had money. Its stupid and I know money does not fix everything but dammit Id rather cry in a nice house with money in the bank than in a dark room in a house that is falling apart. I am dumb enough to think that my mental illnesses will be more tolerable if I had money.,Depression

18853,it is like you are in a room full of sunlight and people. You hear chatter laughter. You feel the sunlight on your skin. Only that the sunlight pricks you like shards of glass And the chatter feels like sharpnoisesthat makes no sense to you.Suddenly it all starts to fade. It feels like you are being sweeped into this big hole of darkness. The light passes by you but does not touch you. There is no warmth. The chatters are now just mumbles fading away. There is silence but not calmness. You sit there quietly falling into this pit of darkness. You want to scream and you are but it just comes off as a smile from your face.The fall is more like a pull like being dragged with tremendous weight to the depth of the ocean the weight of your existence of being worthless of being a burden of being unloveable unfullfilling. You finally hit rock bottom. You break down. Tears flow. You scream. But it does not end there. Even the rock bottom breaks and now it only feels heavier like a never ending fall.Sometimes I touch my wrist to feel the pulse. To check if I am alive. Coz that is the only thing that makes me feel like I am still living. I feel no happiness no remorse no sadness. there is just one feeling left. Pain. And it is never ending This is what depression feels like,Depression
12000,I am 26 years old and feel like I have let a lot of time pass by with a lot of things I have kept for myself. I am someone who never allowed himself to have fun and ever since I graduated college I have been lost. I lost all my skills since graduating since I did not put any of them into practice and I used be so good. Now suddenly I am antisocial i was working on my social skills and was doing kind of better towards the end and I always failes at making connections with ppl from how awkward I am. It sucks because not to brag I am a very good looking person dress nice and put a lot of effort into my looks but always on flight mode and I am so so tired of it. I am putting my cat to sleep next week and its the first death I ever had to deal with. I am 26 and feel so fucking immature and I am ashamed of myself. Of the way I always was behind my girlfriends back ashamed of all my thoughts ashamed of letting my career go to waste and never having the motivation to move forward with it and always ashamed to have any fun since for the first five years of our relationship she would not feel comfortable with me drinking never got drunk till i was 22 or even smoking a bit of weed she did not even know I smoked since I was 22 until COVID and I used that as an excuse to start. Barely ever partied never travelled and never got to develop socially. I am not blaming my gf btw this is all me blocking myself because I was too codependent to admit anything and still am. I feel like Ill always be in this loop. Its a personal hell and the more I see myself aging the worse I feel. I writhe in my sleep at night as I am now. I am fucked. I have Lexapro but never took it I am afraid of risking my creativity. I still write but I suck and am very slow. Oh well. Stuck in a loop vent,Depression

23527,I already struggle with constant depression lethargy and annoyance. The one thing that gets me through it is going for walks and getting some sun. Its therapeutic good for my health and truly allows me to feel at peace. These last two weeks I have had literally only a few days without rain or clouds and the days that were sunny were during the heatwave and it was too humid to enjoy the walk. I live in New England so this weather is ridiculous. I feel like I just cannot catch a break.Every day I get more irritable and depressed. The weather exacerbated my symptoms and I honestly cannot handle another week like this. I feel so tired and sad This constant rain is literally going to kill me,Depression
10049,I know people talk about how much we hate ourselves a lot here because it is very common for depressed people. I was wondering though if others feel this A rational part of my brain knows I should not hate myself as much as I do because the level of hate i have for myself is the same as the level I have for the worst people. Now I might be kind of a worthless piece of shit but also I am not that bad. I do not get violent with people I have never sexually assaulted or done something really fucked up to people. Probably the worst I have done is say some hurtful things and lie. Even though the rational part of my brain can look through all this and go 'well i guess you are not the worst piece of shit it dosent really effect how I feel about myself. I still hate everything about me from my stupid body to my stupid mind. I know its probably a bit much for what I am but god fucking hate me. Hate myself vehemently even though I know in the grand scheme of things I am not that bad.,Depression
21819,I do not feel anything. I am completely numb. I do have friends but I am not sad when I do not see them for weeks. I do not mind being alone. I was not even able to be sad when a close friend of mine died in a car accident even though I wanted to be sad.I had 2 girlfriends. The first one cheated on me after a year. And the second one after 3 years. that is when I lost my self esteem and every bond to other humans. I would not be honest if I told my parents that I love them. It would be a lie. They are existing. I am existing. Nothing more. I do not care what anyone thinks about me and since I got cheated on I do not believe in love either. My feelings are gone for almost 5 years now. I am drowning myself in doing sports and going to the gym because fatigue is the only feeling I know.Anyone feeling similar? I think I could use some help but I do not know what could help me.I do not even know why I am writing this post but I am getting tired of everything I have lost all my emotions,Depression
25348,Me and my boyfriend have been together for about 7months now. We both have mental illnesses and we both have depression. I have been going to therapy for 4 years now and I see clear results. My boyfriend has only now gotten help and he is in an extremely dark place right now. I am trying yo help him but I just do not know how. He has no motivation to do anything and he just seems so down. He does not talk to me about it. Everytime I ask how hes doing he says hes fine. And when I ask him is he sure hes okay he gets mad. I just do not understand why.He does not really do anything for this relationship and I get it I truly do. But it just hurts me and I feel like I am falling back to depression because of this. He never texts me and when we see each other he does not really talk or doesny want to cuddle or anything. We usually just have sex and maybe eat in silence and then go to sleep. And I feel so selfish because my depression is getting very bad. So my question is how do I help him? Can I? What things should I say to him to reming him that I am here? How do I help my boyfriend?,Depression
39637,i used to always think the answer to life wa living i really did but this thing called living is abhorrently cruel all that run through my mind is why would anyone else do it they must know the answer to something i don t they must know that the only thing separating them from everyone else is the collective knowledge possessed to follow through it is such a deep and passionate act that in reality the act itself is the meaning of life the meaning of life is to die,Depression
39229,so i am currently doing a school project where we have to come up with an empathetic invention that help solve a problem that you or someone you know is going through i struggle with anxiety specifically in social situation where i have to talk to new people my project idea is to create a bracelet with a variety of texture to help soothe provide relief ground someone when they are nervous that is discreet i wa wondering if anyone had any suggestion a to texture that help you calm down when you are nervous fabric thing you fidget with etc thanks,Depression
13737,Why these online therapies are do expensive. I cannot afford them how I am going to afford offline ones.I need help and this time it is just feels like swimming at the very same spot for a year. it is so painful.Finally I am start to give up hope to get ok. I am tired very tired. I can never be ok like this.,Depression
8563,This is going to be a long and not first post on this subreddit.I am a 22 year old man and even though I do not like it either when these posts start with a list of things people do not like about themselves they suffer from eucharist syndrome I am going to I believe these are in relation with my problems. I am gay autistic virgin pursuing a useless degree we will return to this no driving lisence barely any money under on my name and below minimum wage income. My future is looking bleak and tbh worse than that of everyone around me. Though they can only help so much. I have yet to find the passion drive or whatever that makes you go from point a to point b in my life.Who can tell well it all went wrong? My tiger mom? Maybe. My emotionally distant dad? Who knows. Sheltering and undersocialisation? Maybe. I have been dealing with depression and suicidial ideations since age 10. My parents made me go to a foreign language school they wanted me to mingle with other elite kids which so to speak was the most traumatic experience of my life crying and begging my parents not to make me go there can you guess wheter they listened? I was bullied daily for 10 years of my life.Everyday of school was a struggle to say I got used to this is an understatement. Even in my head I cannot find my own place in life regular panic attacks and feelings of dread come in every month or so demoralising and demotivating.Recently got an internship in a business consulant company where I constanly underpeform due to lack of knowledge in economics drive and the problems listed above. I got the position on the promise that I will start a Finance BSc next semester. If being late in life in other aspects already was not enough I am graduating with a BSc at 26 which makes me feel terrible. The feelings of dread and inadequacy just cumulate and I am getting close to being overwhelmed. Wierdly enough in times like this I want to talk and meet my mom. I want to get back into the womb where its warm and safe unlike outside here sheltering sheltering. I have wonderful friends and family members who love and support be but being so much behind in life compared to them and not being able to keep their advices in my head makes me feel terrible. Since my experience with most things is utter failure it does not make for a good though pattern does it? Afraid of life and in general of everything but wierdly enough people see me as normalacting sic! I guess at least I was always good at masking.This is one of my dreadful periods each is worse than the previous. Feeling more lost than ever positive thoughts occuring less and less. I really want this to end. Thank you. TLDR Years of abandonment avoidance and deperssion resulted into a warped sense of reality which is selffulfilling. What an ellaborate way to say I am depressed.PS. There were ofc lot of things I did not mention which mounted up to this state of mine but I consider those a result not a because. Thus unimportant. CW Suicide Why I might commit suicide very soon advice and consultation welcome!,Depression
23456,I am 35 years old and I do not remember being happy. There is always something bad happening. And now I am living the worse part of my life. Single unemployed living with my parents again I have no idea what to do with my life because I am not good at anything. I am just tired of trying jobs and relationships and moving to different countries to try to find a purpose. I gave myself until the end of the year but I do not think I can make it. I feel so much pain and I do not care anymore if my family or friends will be sad. They were not there for me when I needed. I think I will take my life because life took everything that I was. I am nothing.. just this pure sadness. I just wonder how people can breath feeling so much pain. Because I cannot do this anymore. How do we keep going when we tried everything and only bad things happened to us? Giving up,Depression

16010,Does anyone else feel like they live by counting down the days? How do I get through a lonely weekend? I count down until Monday. How do I get through a bad week? Count until Friday. It started as a coping mechanism for travel anxiety but now I cannot stop counting days until its over. My issue is I am out of things to count to. The weekend is here so what? I have nothing to do expect be alone. Its the work week now but who cares? I hate my 70 hour a week job. I am starting to get scared of myself I have been getting reckless at the end of counts just so I can manufacture something to look forward to drugs large impulsive purchases and I just feel like I am running out of ideas. Counting down the days until the clock is out.,Depression

23449,I have always had bouts of depression and anxiety. I am on meds. For the past month my first thought right when i open my eyes is death. Death as in disappointment at my life and another day. But when i seriously consider suicide i get even sadder at the thought of not being here anymore. As background I am 42 female ivy league educated uses to be very pretty. In past 5 years i feel I have progressively become more pathetic and useless. I only see aging lonliness sickness and struggles ahead. Whereas i used to live in a nice high rise have friends felt pretty etc now I have ganed 35lbs my hairs thinned out I am stuck living with my parents after i moved here to help temporarily but now cannot get my shit together to move back to my homestate have no friends fertility is shot according to doc n will likely never have kids ever i feel ugly snd i work a shitty contract job. Plus I have had horrible heartburn and nausea for weeks and meds are not working. I am in therapy but feels like i have a new setback each time i start to try to make progress .idk I am rambling. Sorry. I am just so sad anxious and do not know what to do. Everything seems dark. My first thought each morning is death. Help.,Depression

26282,Has anyone tried it ? I have been on it for 2 weeks. And feel fantastic. I commute far for work I was always exhausted and kind of cranky etc. But ever since being on it the tables have turned I feel alot more energetic and happy. St John's worts,Depression
24928,I want to start by saying I do not have clinical depression. Everything is just falling apart and I cannot handle it. My situation is fucking screwed and when I try to make it better it seems I only make it worse.I want to die really. I have wanted to end it all for years but have been holding on to one thing after the next. Now I have got a daughter I am trying to be there for. she is the only thing keeping me here at this point.I am in denial about things and I am like aware of it but I feel like it is worth being in denial. it is not like I cannot handle the alternative but I just do not want it. I know that if it comes to it I will just keep on going but God damn do I want this.You know the worst part is I finally set myself up for therapy when I finally hit rock bottom. I am still at rock bottom but since that day I put in the paperworkapplicationlast Thursday today is Wednesday it can take up to 3 weeks to even get the clinician. I cannot handle what is going on in my head for another two weeks and then wait to even meet the person and get fucking help.I started whipping myself with a belt again which I had not done since 2018. This time I upgraded to the buckle. My back is incredibly bruised and sore. But I like looking at it and I like feeling it in the moment. It makes me feel clear and like I am being punished for all the fuck ups. I feel like I deserve it. I tried to earlier but got stopped because I said something I should not have because I was not thinking.And I am so fucking selfish. Since shit hit the fan I have been focused on myself instead of what happenedwhich was to someone else.. But they do not want to talk to me about it so I am stuck. I ask questions about things that have a concern to me. But this person is the only person I can even ask! I cannot ask someone who does not understand the situation and I cannot ask the person who does so what do I do with these feelings and concerns? The only thing I can think of is just punishing myself for even feeling.Fuck if I could I would go right now and beat the shit out of myself. I am perpetually fucking up. I try to work on things and then continue to make things worse. I feel like a bull in a China shop but the bull keeps trying to put the broken plates back on the shelves. I cannot fucking handle it,Depression
10609,But I do not know where that is anymore. And I do not think I have for a very long time. I want to go home.,Depression

20487,that is right pal! I used to be like you sulking and whining about how unfair life is. But unlike you I just kept my chin up! How easy is that? Whenever I had a negative thought I would just remind myself if I constantly thought like that then I would be an embarrassing loser forever like some people. Thank god I am not!Anyway just wanted to share my success. And remember suicide is selfish! Go ahead and think about how sad the liquor clerk is going to be when you are dead and no longer buying liquor. Who are they going to serve to?Words of encouragement! My life is good so yours must be too!,Depression
25127,As of the time I am writing this its 146 Am July 7th the day before my birthday. In the last couple months I have had alot to endure. Alot of death internal struggles physical problems and more and I have forced myself to endure it all because I do not want to stay weak. However the more I think about my past the more I think about events that should have been critical in my life the more I realise it. I am not weak I am just... pathetic. As much as I want to blame toxic masculinity for things like mostly being unable to cry not kidding I rarely cry with tears because I literally cannot produce them as much as I would like trying to stay tough and more it is dawned on me that I am simply pathetic. I shut myself off from the world from people and blame others for things I have failed at while I know damn well it is my own fault. I have refused to let people in not because of fear I would get hurt but either because I plainly did not care because I refused to accept them into my life or because I was too busy with my own bullshit and simply wanted to go home and lay in bed doing nothing. Its why the memory of my grandfather almost weeping because of pain and speaking to my family haunts me. While he was in more pain I could imagine I was on my phone waiting to go home. I have reached nothing in my life and as much as I say my life is simply not interesting I have never tried to make it interesting. I have always been too busy taking care of my own menial problems and saying I am too busy for anything and when I do start something new 9 times out of 10 I quit it because I just do not give enough of a fuck to see it through. Though I am still young many of my peers have already had much more succes than me. Be it in a financial way a romantic way a social way everyone I know has exceeded me. Even the ones who I never thought would do so well blew me by leaving me in the dust. The funny part is... I deserve it. I have always been a piece of shit. Mentally fragile egotistical greedy selfish jealous sadistic easily angered and more. Its resulted in me being an empty she will of a human being always exhausted always in pain and unworthy of being alive. I have tried to compensate for the horrible person I used to be but by doing that I have almost completely stopped caring for and about myself and though today I heard my boss say he admired that I put others before myself I know who i used to be. And as much as I try to compensate and grow... I know best what I truly am pathetic. My body can often barely keep up I am emotionally mentally and physically drained I am incredibly depressed always feel sick I am lazy always try to get others to do shit for me I am envious and so much more but most of all I am empty.I do not care of I get hurt I do not care if I am healthy I do not care if I wake up in the morning I do not care for shit. Call me out in the comments all you want insult me or whatever I do not care anymore. I know how horrible of a human being I am and I know I am not worth your time or anyones time for that matter. I am sorry for wasting your time but for what it is worth thanks for reading this. The sudden realisation I am pathetic.,Depression
24091,I am a 35 year old Brazilian teacher and I cannot remember the last time I felt meaningful joy. I feel guilty by saying that because I have a nice family and a wonderful girlfriend and they love me and respect me so much but I feel like crap. I did therapy on and off for around 10 years I took medicine I tried meditation... I have dreams that remain that dreams. One of them is to write. I do not fantasize in becoming famous or anything but whenever I sit down to write after I read my production it just sucks so much. it is anguishing to attempt something and realize that you are not good enough for that. I know that something is require practice but I do not feel that all the effort is worth it because in the end I always come to the same conclusion I do not like life I think I never did. I think I have always looked for peace and happiness but I cannot find it anywhere not even inside of me. I just do not know what to decide end everything or accept that I will be forever unhappy until my natural non suicidal death. I think I just need someone neutral to talk because I cannot say these things to my family. Brazilians are too emotional sensitive and almost zero rational so it is be inevitable to hurt someone if I shared what I actually think. I simply cannot stand this place anymore. Is Life Worth It?,Depression
19529,I still live with my family and they think that everything is okay. I spend most of my day in my room alone. But when i interact with my family I am all smiles and happy. I just feel very ashamed to tell someone that I am not happy or that I am thinking about killing myself. I have always been like this never like to talk about my emotions with anybody.I do not know what to do. I have failed school this year because i just could not keep up with online learning but i cannot bring myslef to tell anybody about this. I have been lying to my parents about school and i feel so guilty. I am addicted to weed now. I am such a failure. I just want everything to end. I am very depressed and suicidal but feel very ashamed asking for help,Depression
14474,Again I am ranting on my throwaway.. I feel like I have dug myself in to a giant hole again. I am scared and embarrassed to let anyone in to this mess. I am trying my best to reach put and seek some kind of help. I feel like I am a whirlpool. Life sucks but you have to keep going? I am terrified of the future. .,Depression
48214,I failed I'm going to kill myself soon I just failed the test to get my GED and my family thought I was going to pass it but I didn't I feel like disappointment and I disappointed them they had confidence in me they say I'm smart and I'm a genius but in reality I'm not I'm dumb and stupid and I let them down I feel so worthless and pathetic so now I'm going to drink bleach or any other chemical I can find in my house so I can get so sick that I die I can't do this anymore I don't want to disappoint or let anyone else down,Depression
25378,My husband and I have been seperated 2 years. Last night he told me we are not getting back together and that he is moving in with his new girlfriend. I cannot believe I am holding up as well as I am today because I have been depressed about his behavior for the last 2 months. I do not have alot of friends anymore and I am not sure how to make new ones. I am a 51 yr old female. I am staying with my parent's right now but I am so lonely. My Mom has gotten sick and she is not getting any better. I force myself to keep going everyday and I am seeing a counselor but the sadness is still there. Any suggestions ? Seperated,Depression
47486,I don't care if I hurt anybody I want to emotionally damage as many people as I can regardless if I know them or not. I don't care how good they are it only makes me want to hurt them even more. I absolutely hate happy people and it's worth the effort of bringing them down to my level,Depression
38610,for year now i ve always thought of suicide a a back up plan whenever somethings went wrong i just thought oh well i m not going to be here much longer it doesn t matter but i ve never thought of the aftermath i hate the thought of my decomposed possibly mangled body i hate the fact my family friend would have to see that i hate to put them in that position ive never thought of it in their perspective in general im just a coward it might sound good i don t want to kill myself but now i feel very claustrophobic i feel like i cant breathe there no escape,Depression
47736,So tired of life Im too tired to carry on. University is too difficult. My disability is such a burden. My mental health is spiralling. My acne is so bad I am afraid to look people in the eyes. My social anxiety is awful and Im such an awkward person. Ive been sick for months and its made me become super negative and withdraw from my friends. Im quite shy and it makes people look down on me and ignore me. I was bullied all throughout primary school and basically ignored after that. I wish a car would hit me and itd be all over. Quick and simple. No pain. I know by this point I am the problem and Im not blaming anyone else for whats happened to me in my life. Its just so tiring,Depression
47496,How I feel. This will probably go unseen but I need to write.I feel unheard I am alone and I do not like this world.I hate people this society is terrible. Betrayal runs rampant and hatred thrives. I feel unwelcomed as a white guy like the world is against me. I dont feel unique at all probably because no one tells me I am. In fact no one talks to me to begin with and if they do its because I talked first. Im not sure I want to be here anymore simply because Im not sure what I have to look forward too.Its selfish to say and I feel guilty but everything this life has given me has been taken away. Specifically human connection it is all I want. But I can not have it. My friends leave ignore and forget. My gf left and forgot. No one approaches I feel like a ghost. Im 18 and im not sure I want to stay around for next month when I turn 19.,Depression
10990,I am 14 I told my crush I like him and he likes me back but I do not want to date him tbh I regret telling him cus I could have just gotten over him but now I know that he likes me back Ill feel bad if I get over him. I do not want a crush cus I feel like it distracts me a lot from my studies and I am not emotionally or mentally mature enough to be in a relationship I feel like such a shitty person why does he like me when I am so horrible and indecisive and insecure? Whenever I am alone or late at night I struggle to fall asleep I keep thinking of my failures and I am rlly scared that Ill disappoint my parents and be unsuccessful I feel rlly lonely whenever I am not with my frds it not that I want to kill my self or die i just feel rlly empty inside like I have no purpose in life I wish I could just disappear but without my loved ones being sad from it tho. I kind of want something rlly tragic to happen to me so Ill have a excuse to die i know that once something rlly bad does happen Ill will not actually want that but its just a thought I am constantly having. I know I do not have it that bad and others have it way worst so I feel horrible for complaining and feeling this way I should be grateful for what I have its just sometimes I wish this privilege was given to someone else since I do not deserve it. I feel rlly empty,Depression
23717,I have just had to cut off an extremely close personal friend because of his abusive tendencies. coming to terms with the fact that hes a bad person has been so unbelievably difficult. i feel so alone now and I am wondering if anyone else would ever even love me. I have been searching for a lifelong friend my whole life i moved around a ton and i never got along with my family when i was younger so i never had anybody i could share my life with and i thought i found someone who i could and it turns out i cannot. I have been struggling with depression for a while now and the only person i could lean on pushed me away and hurt me. I am so alone and i do not know what to do. I am not contemplating suicide but i feel like I am dying I am at the end of my rope.,Depression
8219,When I read about people withdrawing during depression I read about how they stay at home etc etc.I have been struggling with depression for a long time now and recently got better but now it is back to being bad again. Ever since I quit meds it is gone this route. I hardly maintain contact with friends and have now officially decided to take a break from social media.I know this is bad but the strange thing is that I still do everything else. I leave the house everyday. I grocery shop do the dishes laundry I want to go to places like art museums and go out shopping or do writingart but I want to be alone. I am not lying in bed all the time either.For some reason I just do not want to have any contacttalk to anyone. This concerns me but I do not know why I feel like this.I am also struggling to feel emotions right now and have lost interest in what I love I seriously do not even feel human at some points which might be why I do not want to talk to people because I do not want to keep up this facade that I am interested in the conversation. Yet I am still going out and doing stuff and have some interests. I just feel totally dead emotionally? I do not know how to explain it but I am trying to pull away from the internet to recharge and whatnot.Any advice or any similar situations would love to hear your advice thank you Socially withdrawing but still doing everything else...,Depression

13477,So I have never been a very sexual person but I still watched porn from time to time even when majorly depressed. Now even that does not excite me anymore. People I had small crushes on do not do it for me anymore. Watching porn reminds me of the fact that sex is so readily available for so many people but not for me. I am actually sad when I watch it now.I am a hopeless romantic I am in love with the idea of being in love but I have given up on even attempting to find it. I am ugly and depressed who would want me? This is actually serious,Depression

25533,I have struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 14 so 12 years now. I was with my partner for 6 years. he never understood my depressive episodes. he often would leave me alone at night crying in the dark.we broke up in April. I broke up with him because of his bad communication but later regretted it. he said he did not want me back but wanted to be friends. I found out tonight he has a new girlfriend he started dating 2 weeks after we broke up. he said he did not love me because I was told frustrating and did not listen. when we broke up I lost the house we built together our dog our garden. everything.my grandma was diagnosed with cancer in January. she was overseas and I could not see her. we were told she had a year left. she had a stroke after one month and died.after the break up I moved into a sharehouse. it was an awful place to live and I was living with alcoholics who would constantly have domestic disputes. I now live with a housemate but I am alone most of the time. none of my friends live close to me. I have no family nearby.my workplace is toxic and manipulative. they put too much pressure on me. they ignored my health issues and made me go without pay even though I had leave. they fired my supervisor without notice.I accidentally got pregnant with a rebound fuck buddy and then I had to have a medical abortion. it was the most painful experience of my life.I am 10k in debt and cannot get out of it.I feel alone. I do not have anything worth living for. I try to be a good person and I try to do things that are good for me but it does not work. I am not worth it. I am not worth loving and I do not deserve good things. I want to die. I am now at the hospital waiting for emergency care.,Depression
21455,Something really bad happened to me and I have officially given up on life. Everyone keeps telling me I am young and I have time and everythings ok but its not. No one is ever here when I am struggling just to get out of bed. No ones ever here until I am ready to be gone forever. And that is not fair. My life has hit so low that I know I am done with it But I know my mom family and my Bf would be so hurt. But I just do not know how else to continue on...... I wish everyone would stop pretending and lying to me like my life matters. I am so lost I feel like I cannot be found. I am mentally done. Thank you for letting me vent. I give up,Depression
27258,So long story short I have MDD GAD BPD. Since late 2020 depression has been kicking my arse. I have suffered with depressive episodes for over 12 years but never this bad or long. My last depressive episode was after the birth of my son and had great success with the 2nd SSRI I tried and managed to establish a good routine to get me out. I am currently on my 7th antidepressant and have been sectioned twice this year for SI with intent. Its marginally better than it was but its getting worse again. Zero motivation to get out of bed no appetite crying etc.I am also doing intensive group therapy since February which I am really invested in but t the end of the day I feel I have exhausted all options Is there any way out without ending it?,Depression

I fear he would tell somebody and only make it harder I am sick of being alone,Depression

15061,I do not enjoy anything about life. I force myself to exercise read and partake in my hobbies because I do not want to be an empty person who does not even make an effort but that has not stopped me from being miserable. Sometimes getting drunk gives me relief but I have to stop since I am on the path to becoming an alcoholic and lack the funds to keep drinking at this rate. I live in a dead area and have no clue how I am supposed to meet someone. I am basically stuck in this position indefinitely until I get a much higher paying job. Unfortunately trying to find one has been a fruitless demoralizing experience with no seemingly no hope. I probably will not be happy even if I get out of this either. I was miserable in college but when I look at it objectively that was the best part of my life by far. My life afterwards has been all work technical assessments and interviews with very little social interaction its soulsucking and this is supposed to continue until I retire. I just do not get how more people are not lining up to kill themselves hell I think about it every day. The expected cycle of life is utter garbage. No part of life is enjoyable,Depression

7924,Hey!Our relationship seemed to have been going really well but then out of the blue she ghosted me for almost a week then said she cannot be in a relationship and that she cannot feel anything. she is been suffering from depression throughout our entire relationship but I just could not help. She does not want to get medical help and I am worried about her and I just cannot bear the thought of losing her. I am still in mad love and we are actually on good terms. I want to be there for her and I want to help her fight her depression but it is very very painful. What should I do? My girlfriend is depressed and says she cannot feel anything anymore.,Depression

18627,well to be honest I do not even know why I am here but I just need somewhere I can voice my thoughts as I feel like they are building in my head to the stage that I would rather talk to my self than others. it may sound like I am exaggerating right but I spend soo much time alone that even when I am with others id rather not be. this is my fault either I was such a funny kid class clown so popular in school and even after I finished school too. but that all changed when I was shipped over seas by my mum. I cannot lie and say know I do not see that it was for my benefit I could have simply died had I stayed there and for a parent that is enough reason. but to send me somewhere like that and treat me the way they did really stripped me for humanity. I saw things I should not have and that is when the thoughts started. I was locked up for about 7 months over seas as my family thought it would help me but there is where I create a version of life in my head and know I cannot escape it. my life is finally going good I have worked soo hard for that but mentally I am suffering soo much. I cannot tell anyone this in real life because why would humans care. they never cared when I really needed them and know it feels like if they do care is because they want something. and also I promised my self that I will never be vulnerable again in this life which is another reason I can never tell anyone. so I smile at the few people I do see but in saying ALLL OF THIS I do want to make friends and there is apart of me that wants to be accepted in someone is life as I really feel like I have never belonged. I would love some tips or maybe books to read that may help me. I REALLY FEEL LIKE I AM DROWNING Why I made this account,Depression
23806,My dad passed away over 5 years ago. My mom could not handle it so she ended up selling the house and we moved to a different city an hour away. The strange part about all of this is my girlfriends brother ended up buying my old house. I was not really a fan of this idea but I was not going to speak up and make things even more difficult for my mom. Now every so often I have to go back to that house for christmas or dinners or whatever. My mom has said she is never even going back to our old neighborhood let alone the house but I feel like I am basically forced to because of my girlfriend. I have told her that I never want to go back but every so often she will say oh my brother invited us over as if I have not told her before that I NEVER want to go back. I have been back a handful of times and I never enjoy myself it just brings back bad memories and makes me feel awful. I am honestly just so tired of doing things I do not want to do because of other people. It feels like its slowly killing me. I do not really know how to deal with this her bringing it up has ruined my day and put me in an awful mood. I do not want to go back to my old house,Depression
16798,Now I get to spend all my fucking time with my abusive parents and never get no chill nor sleep because of them. they will think of anything that Ill hate and make me do it all day every day.Yesterday was literally the one and only best day of my life because I got to celebrate my birthday which was originally on Monday with my closest friends. We smoked some weed listened to music chilled and even freestyled for hours on end. It was the best day of my life but of course it had to end on it. that is it. Back to my usual everyday shit. Therapist are not shit. Parents on their shit again. Everything is back to normal. Summer holidays just started and its only getting worse,Depression

39175,i ve been diagnosed with anxiety for about year now and a far a i can remember i ve never had a full on panic attack before or after my diagnosis for a few day now i ve been having random panic attack multiple time every day i start to tremble and i get major butterfly in my stomach i also can t breathe dry easily and start to sweat a lot what s weird though is that i can think perfectly fine and i can keep doing whatever i m doing while all this happens i can t pin point anything specific that is going on in my life that could be causing this nothing that make me anxious is happening right now i ve never learned any proper coping mechanism to combat this kind of thing either i m not sure what to do,Depression
24139,So I even feel bad about myself for having to write this ir order to feel as if I have someone to speak about this stuff it seems as if people that say to be your friends use your weaknesses whenever they have a chance to hurt you if you let them know about them I have chronic low back pain for 10 years now done physical therapy and all have tried different diets supplements etc nothing has worked on top of that I am in law school and now I do not have the will power or i think even the capacity to learn all of that like normal people do its as if the depression I have felt through my whole life has shattered my brain my hippocampus must be so small by now I understand subjects relatively quick but I forget so much so fast at least if I got my degree my parents would stop watching me suffer like a fucking looser I tend to perceive how sorry they must feel for me at least I am not a drug addic. I try to get better but with no success I study I lift weights and nothing changes maybe I should study more but there comes my crippling add with rumination to fuck up my studying ambitions at least I have a girlfriend that really cares for me but how long will she withstand to be with a fuck up with add chronic pain chronic depression? I feel like if I knew no one would suffer I would just kill myself but I could not do that to the people that care about me so I am stuck here And I know that there are people out there that have it so much more difficult but for me this feels like impossible to get better I feel like a burden useless helpless On not being able to get better,Depression
17569,I feel like there is this deep dark hollow senseless sightless eerie buzzing whispering sadness trapped somewhere inside me that I cannot get access to but it is affecting me every day in a way I cannot grasp. it is like a poisonous snake trapped inside my chest and I want to cut it open and pull it out so fucking bad.it is like being trapped in a cave a thousand miles beneath the ground and not even being able to panick at the sight of inevitable death because nobody knows I am there.Please just make it stop! Please get it out of me get it out!,Depression
14189,I wish people would stop trying to help. Be able to accept someone does not want help. It sounds cheesy but it really is a its not you its me situation. Getting mad at me because you want to help but I do not want help is very counteractive I appreciate it. But I am not looking to get better. I am looking at making it till tomorrow. You interfering makes things worse. Having the responsibility of having to show you your help works will only push me deeper. I will not get better and you will get annoyed that I am just not listening to your help. I do not want to pull up my boots. I have accepted that they will remain loose. If you want to help please stop trying. I do not want to help myself,Depression
10604,Warning Long readI seriously do not know what to do anymore. I am 27 years old still live at home have no friends no so no life no fluctuating income. I feel so stuck and no matter what I try to come up with they never hold any weight. I am on ssi disability for severe mental health issues that I have tried addressing thru pills and therapy been there done that and it has never worked out for the better. Also for this reason I have not been gainfully employed for the last few years. With my state of my mind and circumstance I would not want to wage slave to come home to this same situation anyways. If I did my mental health would probably tank even worse just for a couple bucks. It are not worth it. We all know making friends was hard before covid now after all this craziness it is like good luck with that you know? I have no life at all. I have been watching mma like ufc fights for a long time and only till recently started training mma and kickboxing. With me not having a life thought it would be a great outlet and it is but it is not enough not at all.Classes are like 1 hour a piece and they hold classes 4 days out of the week and honestly I am not old old but I are not a young buck anymore so even doing like 3 classes a week an hour a piece has been beating my body down. I am so sore I can barely bend down down or move. I am hoping by Monday I can train again...Even if I had a body of a 18 year old and I could go all day long 1 hour a day to do something still does not compare to the 23 hours I have left with nothing to do. I am 27 time is just ticking and everything I can try I do not have what it takes to do it and everything I do have what it takes I have tried and failed over and over again. Yes you fail you try again but the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results. Given my circumstance I have tried everything tried to really rack my brain to drastically change my situation and honestly no amount of self reevaluation has helped me figure this out.Me being a mental wreck at most things in life some days I accept that my life may be this way for good but I just wish I had some friends or A friend to talk to or just confide in. it is one thing to go thru all of this but to do it in solitude is just so soul crushing. I know I am a guy and I am supposed to suck it up and find a way and keep trying but how long can I keep trying? This stupid anxiety is the curse of my life I swear. If I was not such a spastic loser none of this would be happening. If I at least had some friends or someone who gave a crap about me maybe I would have the motivation to mustard up some kind of idea or something I have not tried which Idk what since I have thought about everything but this loneliness this emptiness inside me is killing me. I am close to crying as I type this but I am trying to contain myself. Nobody cares and why should they? I am a miserable bitter angry lonely loser with nothing to show for in life after being on this planet for 27 years. I had a passion in acting and music but none of those things are guarantee and it is like winning the lottery.it is ironic because usually people who make it in that industry are pretty fucked in the head like me but they got lucky. I feel like I have the mindset of someone who is famous at least creativity wise and having a good amount of crazy in them but we all know that industry is over saturated it is all dumb luck. They get to release all that craziness but my talent is all wasted and I am just left with the craziness nothing else. For people who would tell me just keep pursuing it it is not as simple. If you do not have movie looks or some kind of connections you will be doing small short films or student films that go nowhere that is reality of holly wood. So at the end of the day it would take one crazy ass miracle to get me out of this situation. I used to be like wow I am 24 now I am 25 now and now I am 27 3 years behind 30. it is nuts man. Why and how did I turn out this way? Was it destiny? I feel like some people are meant to suffer all of their lives no matter what. Like you can play my life scenario a thousand different ways and I feel like some how I will always end up here in the exact spot sitting in this chair typing these exact words. I know this was more of a rant then asking for advice so I apologize but I have no where to turn to. I feel like my existence is literally pointless,Depression

17101,!!VENTING NOT ASKING FOR HELP!!For the past couple of months ever since I quit my job after having multiple crippling panic attacks at work I have been finding it hard to leave the house. it is gotten to a point where I just do not go outside anymore and hide away in fantasies my brain makes waiting to die. Before I tried getting jobs but I cannot hold any down and eventually just stopped trying. For the last 3 months I have been forced to see a therapist the drive there makes me physically ill and paranoid. I still have a hard time expressing to her how I feel in person but I cannot stop seeing her. She has ordered me to go to a doctor twice but I just cannot go.I have a very loving family but they are too loving and not in the ways that I need I have no autonomy or word in decisions made for me. I no longer have the will to argue. I cannot see a future for myself I had plans on moving out before I quit my job but now it is just a cold dream. These feelings are taboo in my family but my parents have been very patient with me until now. I think my mom just kicked me out. I have until Monday to pack to my things she said I am not upset or sad by this it is what I deserve. Not to sound like I am in my own self pity party but I was told that even if I am in such a dark place I still chose to be in the situation that I am in and really I cannot help but agree. How is it that others can still live their day to day lives but I cannot I cannot comprehend it.Anyways I think I am going to homeless but I cannot find the will to do anything about it. disappointed in myself,Depression
19081,I took a break from uploading to YouTube because the editing started feeling like a chore and it was starting to wear me out and I wanted to do other things like draw and read but lately I have not been able to do much because I just feel so...lazy. And stuff that usually make me happy cannot distract me much anymore.I suppose this usually happens when I undergo a lot of anxiety or stress but I dunno man. When I edit videos it feels like I am doing a crazy ton of work but in reality the work I do is PALTRY compared to others. And also I feel as if I have less patience and tolerance than other people and that results in me getting heated and worn out faster.I just want to get out of this hole man. I want to do things but I have this weightnumbness thing in my chest that wears me down and makes me want to curl up and do nothing but at the same time being lazy makes me feel unfulfilled. it is just a loselose. I feel lazy and numb,Depression

26219,I was and I say was because I called my doctor and told her I am stopping it.. I was on 10mg of Escitalopram and after almost a month of taking it I had 6 pills left out of 30 I told her I could not handle the cold legs and feet and occasionally around my chest and rarely arms.. she told me to cold turkey because it was not even a month. Its been three days of not taking it and I feel the paresthesia I used to have coming back slowly besides knowing that it gives you paresthesia while taking it and discontinuing it as a side effect but it was more relaxing while taking it then never having and having to deal with the neuropathy symptoms.. It had pros such as 1. me taking a deep breath and not feeling that heavy rock on my chest. 2. Wanting to do more.3. Half and half on being anxious meaning i had days where I was not and was.4. Less depressed 5. No headaches anymoreCons. 1. Cold legs and feet since June 182. Anxious due to the cold feetlegs.. 3. Body temperature was all over.. I do not understand for a person that lives in the ER I did not pay a visit or exaggerate to get seen and tested. Blood panel was great according to Doctor. that is about it Other than that I had no common side effects. PLEASE GET BACK TO ME ON YOUR OPINION .. Hey guys sorry.,Depression
47794,Feeling useless I don't know what to do with my life anymore. I went to college just because I couldn't see myself working I was able to get into my dream college but not on the course I wanted. They rejected me because there was too many people. I do enjoy mostly just tolerate the subject I'm studying but I hate the thought of actually putting in hours of work just to get a passing grade. When I get home I can't think of anything but sitting down and watching something stop thinking about my real life that has nothing to offer. I don't study at all. I used to draw every day and I must say I'm pretty good at it but I just don't see the point anymore. My friends are not interested in my life whatsoever even though I'm always asking how they are doing and if they need any help I don't remember the last time somebody texted me just to talk. My parents say they love me but I can't really believe it thanks to their lack of interest in my childhood. Money is not a problem for me they never said that they want me to pay them but I feel like I should put in at least a little bit of money. I got sick two days ago and all I hear when my mother gets home is that the dishes are not clean. They ignore my confessions I'm trans get mad at me and then say that I'm lazy for sitting and not doing enough... Which is kind of true. All I do everyday is to think that one day it will get better but it's hard to keep going. I can't look in the mirror there are days where I just don't eat because I don't see the point I don't take showers I don't take care of my face anymore. I just feel like an intruder in this world. Useless. Piece of trash that's just thrown around. A cheerup plushie that's useful when somebody needs a hug or a punching bag when somebody wants to shout at it. I don't see my future. All I see is how miserable I am.,Depression
47695,I'm just tired. I want to die. Everything is as fine as its going to get. I just want to go home and blow my motherfucking brains out.,Depression

22446,About a year ago I finally came to terms with ending it all. My final trigger will be the loss of my job. I was told 2 years ago that I will lose my job but they keep stringing us along. Its coming soon. I have cleaned out most of my house except for the essential creature comforts it will be easy for someone to finish cleaning up. I plan to leave as little mess or trouble behind as possible. I am 38 and have been alone nearly my entire life. I have everything but love and affection. A very good paying jobfor now with one of the largest companies in the world a house 2 cars. I do not even look at my bank account I know the money is there. I was born to older parents they were married 30 years before I was bornlast of three and they hated each other. their relationship was strictly business by the time I came along never saw affection between them. My sister was 10 years older and she was more like a distant relative. my brother 5 years older died in a car accident at 19. My mom died when I was 20. I was never close to my dad or sister the only remaining family. We tried when my sister had a kid but spending time with each other was like sitting in a waiting room with strangers. ampx200BI have always been the loser the one to be picked on. I have been told since early on that I am ugly and creepy. It goes back early in elementary school when someone told a girl that I liked her and she cried. I spent my entire school career barely surviving panic attacks and anxiety. My parents never taught me how to take care of myself I was the smelly dirty kid all the way through high school. I did not attend any sort of social gatherings or even my graduation. No romantic interests from anyone. Some how after high school I got a girlfriend for about 2 years. Still a dirty kid I do not know how that happened. She left me my mom died shortly after and I started to learn how to groom myself. 15 years of zero romantic interest from anyone from 20 to 35. about 10 years of that on every dating site I paid for all the perks and crap. barely anyone will even talk to me. Managed to get a handful5ish of first dates over 10 years never a second. One girl met me in the parking lot of a restaurant for dinner and literally said nope and 180'd to her car. At 35 I met Laura online and managed to date for a few months. She was on paper everything I ever wanted. There was something wrong she was just so cold zero affection. There was some things I knew would lead to a toxic relationship and I broke up with her. I still feel that was a mistake. That maybe I could have been a better person. She was just sort of immature and i do not know. She was in her 30's and lived at home with momdad was a teacher at the same high school she went to she was just like a perpetual 17 year old.anyway 3 years later. this past holiday the 4th was the first time in 3 years that I have seen anyone outside of work. I cannot socialize anymore. everyone is married with kids I am almost 40 and have spent my entire life alone. I have missed everything never taken a trip no weekends away no amusement parks no beach no holidays. How can i do those things without someone to share the experience with is not that the point? I spend every holiday alone in my house watching TV. I have not celebrated my birthday probably since my mom died 18 years ago and that is only because she would bake a cake.I have cleaned out most of my house I have severed ties with the few coworkers that I kept in touch with after they moved on. I have not talked to what is left of my family in almost 5 years. Soon we will finish the final contracts at work and I will be let go and I will finally be free of the pain. Almost to the final precipice,Depression

11180,Trigger warning This is mostly based on the fact that my mom always wanted me and my siblings to go to the curch but I was the most sensitive one.I do not have any friends so I did not talk about it with anybody but my mom but I cannot do that anymore.Three years ago I confessed for the first time that I tought God was evil and they told me to pray for things to change.Three years later I have always been praying with the same feelings and now I cannot even think about God without feeling hatred and despair.When I was a kid my mom always tried to get me to go to the Orthodox curch and fast. Three years ago I was having problems sleeping due to my growth and my mom told me it was because I did not come to the curch with her.I got really scared.Basically being scared was the only reason I believe in God and why I am doing so badly.Now I was scared of more than not sleeping I was scared I will go to hell and that God will punish me for the tiniest bad tought.I even got a tic in my mind I say forgive me GodI was not alowed to sleep more than 6 h to eat fully or without praying and I prayed more than 1 h and did 50100 prostrations and reading everyday fasted for half a year every year I slimmed up 20 kilograms and got sick and after a long period I have had an operation to remove my colecist.I was extremely stressed out everyday not to make a single sin and do everything right.Now cannot go to curch anymore and I want God to dessapear and to live a paceful life but I fear I cannot.I want this to end be it depression or anything else.I am hurting myself and cry every single day for the same reason for a year and my mom does not really want me going to a therapist nor to get medicine.Sometimes my family makes fun of me and over all does not care.I do not have any friends and I do not know what I will do with my life.My mom now blames me saying that I was a fool back then but I was just a child and she were so prowd of me back then. She was saying that God had blessed her. I have never seen my mom so happy and proud and now that I am not trying to do everything right she started to scolds me again and I felt so bad.Recently she admited she had mistaken but she still makes so many of those twisted assumptions about me and thinks suffering it is my fault for having a bad temper.All these Years I have been doing whatever her and my father told me my father was knoun for baing the weirdest and most insufferable one when I was arownd 13 he told me I may become a slut because I was having impure toughts and that gave me so much suffering for all these yearsnow he died and my mom still thinks he was a saint but thinking about him is like thinking about hellAll these years I prayed that I will love God and I ended up hating God.I do not really want to make up with God.I tried but things only got worse every timeI cannot help but blame my mom because I always believed in her worlds weather I wanted or not.Even now it is the same.She is very confident and her belief is everything there is for her.She told me everything there is wrong about humans and life and it gave me depression because everything was bad and everyone was wrong. She also believes stuff that hurts me like it is the fault of the damn feminists that womans suffer these days working and the families have been destroyed and tells me there is no hapiness on earth nor something worthy of your time other than going to heaven.I do not want to go to heaven I just want a paceful life.But what can I do and where can I go to escape God?Everything normal people do is a bigger or smaller sin and I cannot stop thinking about all my mom had told me and I believed.Everything comes into my head how if you are making a mistake God will give you punishments for you to wake up and come to the right path.And if you do not then that is your fault for going to hell where there will be fire 10000 hotter and if you are debauched bugs will eat you alive forever and there is guilt fear and dispair and crows eating the belly and chest of women whom aborted children forever and ever.What can a therapist do about that though?I do not know if my family is bad my dad is disinterested but my mom never let me believe that God can be interpreted in any other wayand I am scared to do it.She also thinks that God is all loving but the fear of God is the first love.she will make fun of other people who do not have the same beliefs as her and I hate that.She also thinks that I am genuinely a bad person and that I have to change.I do not think she is ok with me not being perfect she tells me if you behave like that you will end up in a hell hole in life nobody is going to be good with you.She wants me to always forgive she always tells me a story with a woman who confessed she was getting bitten by her husband and the father told her to keep water in her mouth all dayso she would shut up.She wants me to accept life is trash and be humble and kind no mather what sometimes she just tells me I do not understand and that is why I feel like this is bad... I am a teenager and I think I have trauma,Depression

48238,im scared that ill get depressed again in summer ive had depression for five years now. and ill just say that last summer was the worst. a lot of shitty things happened but long story short i moved to a new city a new country actually so no family too for college all by myself and was alone for a solid two months. my depression really hit rock bottom. i was so unstable and just unwell. the only thing i looked forward to was talking to my therapist who btw ended up being incredibly irresponsible. im now surrounded by lovely people but theyre all leaving the city for summer break. i cant stop worrying that ill become depressed again. my plan for now is to take summer courses and pick up a campus job e.g. working at the library. perhaps ill pick up a casual parttime job as well. i just want to make sure that i keep myself busy. last summer was tough cause i didnt have the means to meet people and interact and im hoping this time itll be different if i put myself out there. honestly though i just cant help but worry a lot. depression is my worst enemy and it lives inside me. at this point i cant let it fucking win again. i think of warm sunlight but instead of warmth i feel this intense sorrow. i want this to change. i want this summer to be a good time.,Depression

Had to block the number to stop getting notifications asking me if I accepted the terms and conditions and wanted to be connected to a counselor. Go America.I guess I just want to go on record that I am begging for fucking help just for someone to fucking care I tried at least a dozen times over to engage with the AI interface to get an actual human being.... fucking shit.

22579,there is so much going on in my life whether its family issues financial issues relationship issues etc. I have been diagnosed with depression since I was 8 years old I am currently 19 and have been off of meds since I was 18. Everyday is a struggle.there are many times when I have these thoughts of much better it would be just to end it all. I am genuinely tired of being tired. I know what everyone says ohh things get better its not always going to be like that you will be ok . But in reality I do not ever think I am going to be ok . While I am writing this I feel numb empty nothing I wish I could feel anything besides feeling hopeless. Drugs do not help anymore I honestly do not know what to do I just feel like offing myself would be the best option . I would say this is a cry for help but idk if is ..I just want to give up so bad I honestly have no clue,Depression

26915,Hello. Painful psychic anesthesia is my diagnosis. feeling of insensibility or painful sorrowful insensibility. And I noticed one strange detail. Nobody in America knows about this phenomenon. All people know what depression is but there is not a single forum or article about mental anesthesia. Has anyone heard something about mental anesthesia? Maybe you know a forum or site where this phenomenon is described? Painful mental anesthesia,Depression

18260,Long rant warning.I feel depresssed. After a 3 year break from school i decided i want to make a change for my life to pursue a career as a nurse as i have always wanted to be on a medical team. I fall behind on my studies so i ought to look for tuitions. So now i have a new tuition teacher he is efficient had cultivated lots and lots of A score students.I am always making mistakes its hard for me to understand what they are saying and the teacher encouraged to me it is preasuring us to interact with him otherwise we will not be allowed in class online classes. I do not know how to answer my national language is not as good as the others so i might be blurting out gibberish.He is straight foward and always say that i am wrong. It is a normal and rightful thing to say and i do have to know if i am doing it right or wrong it is his job but my depresssed mind kept interpreting it as disgust because i am older than other students yet am still far behind. When he speaks to me it is very hurtful even though it is beneficial or normal reaction or rightfully or some positive shyt. I felt that my depression sadness and broken heart are irrational and unjustified. It is really hindering me from my studies and possibly future job i have anxiety and just the thought of every thing concerning my studies or my teacher are making me soo sad and heart broken.What do i do? Should i go see a doctor? But my hospital is in lockdown because of the covid outbreak inside it. Should i take a break from my tuition? I do not want to be seen as a coward and run away from my problems i also want to be one of his successful students. If i were to persue in nursing there will be much more harder trials than my teacher correcting me. I am falling apart me falling behind on studies is really making me depressed and despair. I think i could mention to my tuition teacher about my mental illness and take a break again from the tuition until maybe the doctor sorts me out. What do you think? Sorry for the rant. Grateful but feeling sad because of my teacher any advice would help.,Depression
23501,I am 15 and have been depressed for years not told a single person out of a combination of fear and humiliationmy family is extremely insensitive to metal disordersI do not want to reach out to an adult because my family would find out technology is one of the few things that keep me sane and that would all be either destroyed or sold I have considered talking to a close friend about it so I have someone Ik to talk to I do not know how he feels about metal problems. I fear he would tell somebody and only make it harder.the only way to get a therapist would be to inform my parents I am sick of being alone,Depression
16683,I worry if I am on it for like a year or more I will start getting sexual disfunction and stuff I am only 16 so I really do not want this. I have been on 8mg citalopram for 4 days now and have experienced no real side effects just maybe drowsiness and nausea but the nausea is super mild and idk if the drowsiness is really even from the meds because I have always kind of felt a lil drowsy. its not affected my sex drive at all and i really pray and hope it does not because I am only 16 as i said. i do not want it to ruin anything for me. if i go up to 16mg do you think it will? I am going up in only 3 days to 16mg. I am excited because I have noticed benefits with it already like getting rid of my morning tremors that have affected me for like over a year now. everything else could possibly be a placebo... like how i feel like I am better in the morning. normally id be super angry and just tense but i have not felt tense at all really. like mentally.i only plan to be on them for maybe 6 months at most i just worry about long term side effects and it seems like everyone has story about it affecting their sex drive. thank God mine is still fine. but its a little weird how everyone experiences a lot of side effects the first week and i feel almost nothing... is something wrong? is it not working for me? idk. the anxiety and depression have not went away though just a lil better on depression. i hope to see major progress though soon and I am going to go to therapy and cbt and hopefully with help from that i can come off them and be recovered or something. but yeah what do you guys think? how long should i stay on them to not get long term stuff? thank you. How long should I stay on antidepressants?,Depression

13158,I think many people are familiar with some kind of alternative of this phrase. It can be a good descriptor of what fighting with depression is like.For me if feels like no matter how much I do I can never be a normal person with normal feelings. Nothing is satisfying nothing is enough to motivate me to do anything in my life. it is pure conscious pushing that gets me to do anything at all.Thus barely surviving but not actually living.My brother is watching a medical show and I am with him in the living room. A character got in a coma and drama ensued. The doctor came in and explained how she had no more motor function or something? And he says ..she has no higher cognitive function. she is surviving not living The quote gave me chills. Why is there a comparison between someone in a literal coma and me? But maybe this is a good description of how debilitating this dumb mental illness is. ...surviving not living,Depression

8652,I have not been able to sleep because I have been constantly crying. Heck I am still fucking crying. Just last night me and my sister finally spoke up against my mother. My mothers always been putting us down and telling us about how much she is sacrificed for us and I know I am supposed to feel grateful but the way she says it makes me feel like I am a financial burden and all this degrading has like internalized into a deep self hatred over the past 15 years. I had just graduated college and honestly I really cannot afford to live on my own because of my health conditions and that my state is very costly to live in. I would not be able to afford living on my own unless I risk my health and risk losing my dream of being able to do art. My hands will not be usable if I had to work 2 or more minimum wage jobs. And last night was just the final straw. I am so fucking sick of the same fucking shit and its like nothing I do enough is good enough to satisfy her. Oh you got good grades? Well my coworkers daughter was valid Victorian. Oh you are studying art? Well its not going to get you work and I know my coworkers daughters who are nurses now and make so much money. I just want to have some even if its just a little validation like maybe a good job or something but all I get is 15 years of self hatred a loss of my will to live. I swear the only few reasons I am still around are just personal projects obligations to hang out with people and the fear of death but at this point idk if I can take this shit much longer. I just want someone to tell me that I am not a failure. Is that too much to ask? I feel like no matter what I do its never good enough and if I want to do something Id end up where I started,Depression
7740,My names Joey. Ever since about 4th grade I have had anxiety because my teacher was a total prick and he would yell at the class and be mentally abusive as fuck to us. So not sure if that is part of my trauma. ik I am not as strong as some people but that def added to part of my trauma.. anyways i developed a social anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder which hindered my ability to make friends so i had like 3 friends max.. i only talked to them sometimes too not even close friends because of my anxiety and lack of motivation. i would spend all day playing on my laptop when i was a bit younger because it was an escape for me. I could just avoid my life and play video games all day because my parents are lenient. I started developing a depressive disorder probably because i also started smoking weed about a gram a day of some strong dispensary weed for about 34 of a year. My brain was fucked i could not think at all could not concentrate on anything for more than like a minute hell i could not even concentrate or remember like anything from like the past day or two.. I was contemplating just starving myself to death because i did not know what the fuck to do but i realized that there is other ways.. not at the time.. but now.. i got a nurse practitioner who gave me Citalopramantidepressant ssri and recommended counselling and i accepted the counselling at the time. I declined later on when i got a phone call from the receptonist to make a counselling appointment or whatever because i thought i was feel better and i was. the side effects sucked. no sex drive really and insomnia. then i started smoking about a gram a day again which in about 5 days i went into a psychosis and got extremely anxious agitated panicky and even yelled at my parents and told my mom to fuck off because she thought it was just anxiety and i knew it was not. Anyways she was broken inside because of her anxiety disorder and she could not handle it. I am out of psychosis now and looking into antidepressants again with something to help me sleep. I think it was the weed combo that did that sorry for wasting your time if you r reading this ik its a lot of writing. here is my story 15M,Depression

10157,I just do not know how longer I can do it. I used to call myself a survivor. But I know I am not one. I know time's running out for me.I do not really know how muchbut there would not be enough time. I know that I can cheat death only for so long before it gets me for good. And I have doing that my entire life. One day it would get me by hook or crookone way or another.I am still holding on and trying but I cannot stop hiding from it forever. And I know I am losing this game like always but this time it would be a permanent check mate. In this so called game of lifethis would probably be my last failure.I know that just by writing all this makes me so selfish in a lot of waysbut I do not know what to do. I do not know how to end this postso this also would remain incomplete edited I used to call myself a survivor. But I know I am not one.,Depression

10253,Its become pretty hard to sleep at night. Feeling as if my demons are watching over me and preventing the happiness that I used to feel. I sit and stare into myself deeply with the mirror across from me. Realizing I am not the same person I used to be. Feeling as if I am lost and alonefeeling of desperation for that happiness I cannot even seem to remember. I cannot the control feelings that have been driving me crazy. The feelings that make me feel heavy dark and lost. Almost as if my mind is unable to be cured from myself. I know it is all mental all in my head and my own doingyet I cannot escape it. Almost as if I am torturing my own self for whatever lies below. I know there are people out there that have this same issue plenty yet why do I feel so alone? Why do I feel as if I cannot help myself. I am stronger than this and I know that yet why do I feel so weak? This will not be the end of me. So I must suffer or figure it out but I will not let it ever win. I will not be on of the many defeated. I will push on keep motivated that there will be light at the end of the tunnel that there will be that desired treasure we all have been craving. Many hide the shame associated with these feelings myself included. Many do not know how I feel or how much it truly bothers me but I will push on. I have shared to those that I know will support. I have found I am not alone after all. It does get better. I am doing much better now than I was months ago let alone years ago. Maybe I have been looking at this all wrong? Maybe do not look for an escape do not look for a way out but to look for a way to cope. A way to look at the brighter side. A way to live in one with these demons with these tortures and all as it is part of life. It is what we cast upon ourselves due to whatever we have going on. Whether it is our fault or not we must coincide with these feelings and use them to power ourselves on. I will not lose I will win this war. Anxiety,Depression
13658,Tw SA over dramatic life storytelling PSA it does get better. but not if your brains chemically imbalanced.the suicidal thoughts started in grade six i remember because in class i drew this picture a picture of a girl me that just blew her brains out with a pistol. my teacher saw it on my desk amp i was reported etc they called my mom i had to go to the counseller twice or whatever. funniest part is my drawing was caption goodbye cruel world i was 11 or whatever what did i even know about how cruel the world is.going into grade 11 same 5 words pass my lips everyday. I am going to kill myself. its almost comforting. when I am breaking down i repeat it to myself it usually goes like this. i am going to kill myself. i am going to kill myself. i am going to kill myself. i am going to kill myself amp it will all be okay it will all be better.it brings a sense of relief.i have never actually tried to kill myself yeah I have sat down amp started swallowing some pills but I have stopped myself who uses pills anyway the success rate is not in my favour. its been 5 going on 6 years since I have had a day without being suicidal. i am 16. this is not the way it should be. i forget there is literally people that do not have suicide cross their mind at every inconvenience maybe that just makes me over dramatic.worst part is i put myself in all the situations I have had to overcome. grade 8 guygrade 11 asked me to come hug him at lunch he did more than hug me. in his defence i did flirt with him i did send him things. at that point i had not even had my first kiss of course everything i said to him was bs i just wish i made it clearer. i spent the rest of that day in the bathroom scrubbing my skin followed by a silent bus ride amp the longest shower when i got home.grade 9 i know some people say your boyfriend cannot r4pe you. but he did. i said no so many times i lost count. when i asked him if he heard me he said yeah but i was just too horny aight. he would not let me leave him he harassed me amp said my death would be on him if i left. i sound insane for staying but you really do not know what those words feel like till you are in that situation. i feel jacked for missing him i miss him one of the most traumatic experiences of my life amp i want it back. atleast i knew someone loved me enough to threaten to kill me if i leaved them. grade 10 started online schooling permanently. i cannot deal with seeing my ex. the year my attraction to guys my age completely vanished. not going to mention any details of my current bf just know I am not getting better i am not healing i am damaged amp leeched onto the first boy man that showed me any attention. he is not hurting me to make that clear i just know this is wrong amp its just damaging me further. the relationship technically is not illegal. but its not something he would want people to know because yes it would make people lose respect for him. i do not know what is wrong with me I have never been to a therapist or anything. but i do not think its normal i cannot have more than two consecuative good days. if i do you best know the third day ends with me amp a bottle of pills having a stare down.i am afraid i am afraid because when i was sitting there with a bottle of pills i used to think about how my best friend would feel used to make me bawl my eyes at the thought of leaving her alone. that thought does not make me cry anymore. i am afraid of having a worse day than normal amp it ending with me lynching myself. because nothing is keeping me here i do not feel guilty about leaving anymore. one more push amp its over .on top of everything i do not get my period anymore hardly anyways. breaks my heart but i guess its for the best. i would be a terrible mom. it does not get better,Depression

47967,Don't know what to do anymore Back when I was in high school I was struggling to make friends and didn't have the greatest of home lifes either my parents argued all the time and at times when they had no form of release for their anger and frustration I would end up their verbal punching bag or in extremely rare cases physical action would be taken as well. Back then I was on a constant mental decline due to loneliness and solitude I constantly found my self in. In order to try and combat it I did theater programs run through my school. The high school I was at is know for their theatre programs as well as their music department. Though run by about 34 teachers the school was known for how much it did within the field. the shows had thousands of dollars spent on them each year the music students took trips to music competitions with everyother year taking them to a competition in NYC. I loved theatre even did quite well in it up until I was about 21 but it wasnt the environment of the school that got me into it. It was the fact that all the students seemed to friends with each other. Casts of the school shows seemed like familys at times and with my home life the way it was I wanted something like that. So I joined the select choir that led to me being subtly hinted at to audition for the schools shows well as subtle as people in that field could be. I did so hoping to join the family they created and got into the shows and was a part of the cast every year. now long story short I was never accepted fully into their family it was those teenage years where they had already determined friend groups but it allowed me time away from home for as many hours as possible. So some days with rehearsals or performances I would be at the school starting at 7 am until 11 pm. So I dedicated myself to the shows they were the one thing that really kept me going. Cut my senior year I was known for being a bad student amongst my peers. I never did homework because I would be too depressed at home to do it so many teachers would yell at me in front of other students in attempts to get me to improve my habits. None of it worked though mostly due to the fact that test scores could easily out weigh a students homework score to create a passing grade and with me never really getting below a 90 percent on any test it led me to focus on theatre instead. I loved it at this point the fall semester I was planning to audition for colleges and try to make a career out of this. Not only that but my school vocal director who doubled as the musical director chose a show we were gonna be dumping money into. I mean I think the show spent around 200k fabrics imported for India a large bell was made so it could be rung on stage without making a sound costumes rented from the former professional touring production it was a lot. I was excited for the year my fellow seniors were all really talented and it felt like for once I had a piece of the future to look forward to even if it was only 6 months worth of future. It didn't last long though. before the call back list was posted one day many of us were hanging out in the vocal directors classroom one girl was sitting behind the desk of the director since it was the most comfortable chair there when she started going though some of the directors things. When pressed about it she said she was looking to see if her boyfriend at the time had made it into the show if he didn't then she'd have to do her senior show without him. Another guy started to help her out of what I could only assume to be a mixture of bordem and curiosity when they stumbled apon a mock call back list as well as peoples rating for their auditions. the guy realized that they shouldn't be doing this and backed away to talk to others while the girl looked around asking others to look at it all for her. I wanted friends so I did. I told her that her boyfriend had a good audition and when other students pressed me about out it we talked about the call back list. The director eventually found out that people were going through her desk and when she asked other students about it they all said I had done it in search of the call back list. None of them said that anything about the other two students they didn't tell her how I just read out what they had found they placed everything on me. I don't know why they all did this I dont think I ever will but it led to the director to looking to see if I had done anything else. Apparently at this point other students had claimed that I said that a girl wasn't in the call back list and it saddened her to the point of tears first off that was wrong because I distinctly remember saying that she had a damn good chance to get the leading role along with everyone else on that list for it. She was and still is extremely talented and I've never claimed anything else. Next these students said I read the transcript of a math class for another student and bullied them for it. Now with this I did read this transcript the student had left it out on a table in the vocal classroom for about 23 weeks and one day I picked up and read it made a comment about to to other students in the room and put it back on the table it was. Unknown to me at the time that student had dropped out hence why he never came to retrieve the paper and why itd been there so long. I know the entirety of that situation because I had reached out to him to apologize when people started to blame me for him dropping out. He told me it was fine and didn't know what was happening because he made and followed through on that decision far before any of this happened. Unfortunately for me though the director only heard that the student dropped out and that I according to others had bullied him. She pulled me aside one day to tell me how disappointed she was in me she told me how she knew everything I'd done and that there's no reason to attempt to lie about anything. She said I was the reason that kid dropped out and that I robbed her of the chance to save him she said I violated her trust by going through what must have been all of her things to find the audition information and she said that she couldn't believe I would lie to people and tell others that a girl wasn't up for a role where she really was. I didn't know what to do the director what certain in what she knew and I knew she wasn't changing her mind on any of it so I just through tears said I was sorry that I didn't mean to hurt anyone. The director was like a mother to me and now she was pinning all these things to me and I didn't know what to do. So as punishment she wanted me to apologize to the girl I was to never be in her classroom without her being there and that she couldn't in good faith help me with any college auditions. She finished it all off by saying that because of this all she didn't know if she could ever trust me again. It broke me I isolated myself for the rest of the school year she thankfully still let me be in the show that year but I tried to not talk to many people at rehearsals if I wasn't spoken to first. I applied for other degree fields at colleges. And outside of school I rarely spoke to anyone unless it was online gaming. I didn't perform for over year after that I couldn't get myself to be near a stage. I eventually got the courage to audition for the theatre department at the college I attended and got in. But after a year and a half the anxiety of being around a stage and performing and the anxiety that I would just be someone's scape goat or disappointment again led to major problems for me. I developed a severe panic attack and anxiety disorder and my body would start literally breaking down under the stress of it all leading at points to trips to the ER for internal bleeding. I quit performing for good after that I haven't been on a real stage since I was 19 and I haven't performed since I was 21. I'm 23 now and I don't know what to do I had to drop out of college because of my mental health my father has threatened to kick me out of the house because my choice to leave school and when my mother opposed his idea threatened to divorce her and list me as the cause.im stuck in a deadend job working 60 hours a week and I've lost all will to do anything. I don't know what to do I've lost everything and have no one. I just wanted friends and ended up here. I have a therapist but even after sessions I just leave feeling empty. How do I keep going like this,Depression
39188,when i got my diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder i wa very optimistic and relieved i had been living with this condition for many year completely unaware the diagnosis wa a spark of hope perhaps one day i d be able to recover with the proper combination of therapy and medication year later now i must admit i feel exhausted with life it s really depressing to live with the knowledge that i have to be constantly alert to my condition or it will spiral and get worse yes treatment can help but needing to continually use cbt meditation grounding technique etc just to do the thing normal people do without difficulty is infuriating i feel like this isn t nearly talked about enough in mental health circle anxiety and depression are portrayed often a condition which can be fixed with the right cocktail and not also sometimes a life long condition which can exhaust not only you but your loved one i don t know just feeling bitter today,Depression
27090,I have felt like this for a while however only recently realised shit maybe I am depressed. I suppose its just not a nice realisation to make. there is this constant gnawing at my chest not quite a pain but a presence that pushing on my chest with my worst days life being unbearable agony and pain. I have got good friends and I am happy that for the most part I can enjoy my time with them despite that cavity in my chest being a constant present but as time goes on I notice I am experiencing increased highs and lows. Its bizarre but I have been the happiest I have been in a while despite being depressed I suspect for a year or two now singing with these friends a week or two ago nothing special but I was ecstatic for a week and then all of a sudden I became the most depressed I have ever been. It also somewhat scares me that I think my friends noticed this although I understand the irrationality of this fear. I am not in as deep as a low now anymore hence which I am on reddit looking for help I suppose but I do not really know if or indeed how long I will yoyo like that. I am sure it does not help for my moods that I am basically starving myself right now but that is what I am doing regardless. I am very conscious of my wrong actions and yet I do them anyway and I do not know why. Also I think about killing myself quite a bit what would other people think how would I do it but that being said I think its more of a thought experiment than me genuinely being suicidal. I do not really know what this most is other than me admitting to myself that I am indeed depressed. Time to go out and look for meaningless sex I suppose. Jokes aside thanks for the platform and I appreciate any antidotes or advice you have. I have realised I am probably depressedrant.,Depression

7891,Is it normal to have no friends as an adult? My family keeps yelling at me because of it and its getting quite annoying they are really mean about it I am miserable,Depression
9574,So long just doing nothing. Mindlessly following a dangerous obsession. Trying to pass the days just waiting to die. Waiting for something to happen. My family will be sick of it soon. They already are. they have had more than enough. I did not sleep again. I have an appointment at 130 and its 7. I cannot miss it. Hopefully i do not. I wish it would just stop. I wish I was not so pathetic and lazy. Its true. I am looking for escapes. They do not come easy sometimes. Eagerly awaiting the greatest escape of them all. I honestly just feel defeated. I feel nonexistant.,Depression
17039,My daughter who is about to turn 14 has always been different. She is diagnosed with being on the spectrum. She has social anxiety and a little learning disability. I held her back in the 3rd grade because she was reading well but since then took off. Gets mostly As a few Bs. Socially though only a couple friends she has. She does not like being in crowds at all. does not like loud noises. We have adapted and things been really good. If you met her you would think she is a happy go lucky kid. She just started getting her period and it all went to hell. does not matter if she is on it or not she has gotten mean toward her sisters. She confided in me that she feels dead inside and is not happy cannot feel joy. I asked her if she ever felt like hurting herself and she says no. I asked her if we can talk to someone about this and get help and she absolutely refuses and would never talk to me if I made her go talk to a doctor. Also made me swear to tell no one. Her Mom called me today we are divorced and told me she noticed changes in her and her lashing out at people. I do not know what to do force her to go to counceling. She needs help. She needs to know how to deal with her feelings and that she does not have to feel this way. Any suggestions? I need some advice for my 14 year old daughter,Depression
16606,i have not showered in almost a week. i also have not been taking care of my skin. everyone else around me is doing well it seems and i feel like a failure. i feel alone.,Depression
21210,Same routine everyday Wake up work come home shower lay in bed and scroll on my phone with youtube in the back ground as I think about all of the time that is passing me by all of the things I no longer enjoy doing and how void I am. Weekends Wake up lay in bed scrolling on my phone as I wallow in emptiness sleep. Realized I have done nothing for the past 4 years.,Depression
10011,I am in one of those moods where I just do not want to talk to anyone and be alone. I live alone and my family is just pushing me. They keep texting asking to see me and I try to blow them off but they do not stop. Idk why I cannot just tell them what is wrong I just feel like so withdrawn My family is smothering me,Depression
24159,I am promising this because I have experienced it.On Monday I attempted suicide and now I was being serious. Before this attempt I had only self harmed and overdosed in small amounts. On Monday I drank an entire bottle of sleeping pills. I was seriously going to die.While I was still conscious I started feeling regret. For the first time in 2 years I realized that my problems did have a solution and a date. They were eventually going to end but committing suicide was the only mistake I was not able to retract from.I felt regret. I felt treater for all the things I did not do. I felt regret for leaving my loved ones behind. I did not have enough strength to call 911 so I just blacked out praying because I still wanted to live. Miracles happen and me being able to write this is one of them.I did not die. I cannot explain how. I drank 100 pills did not go to the hospital and somehow managed to survive.Today one of my friends called me. She even invited me to a trip.I thought I was alone. I thought no one cared about me. It turned out to be false. People care. I only had to wait 2 days more.If I had died on Monday I would have died believing a lie. I would have died thinking that my life was doomed. I would have just died in vain.Please stay strong and know that fighting is worth it. Things get better I promise. They got better for me. They can get better for you too.,Depression

14286,so in april I started a new job for the 1st time in years its a good job and I was good at it. I was doing so well i stopped taking my meds because i did not think they worked anyway and I do not like being on them. then i started burning out. no matter how much I rest i never feel any better. I am trying to get a sicknote but the dr would not see me I have been off for a while so there is a very real possibility i might lose my job. this has messed up every good thing I have had in the past. jobs relationships education have all been fucked up at some point because of my head. I feel like I just do not belong in this world no matter how hard i try mental illness ruining my life again,Depression
23405,I guess I just need to vent. I am a nurse and the pandemic was hard. I lost a lot of patients. I worked so much mandatory OT that it pushed me into another tax bracket and owed taxes. I thought it would get better but it has not. Now that our infection rate is down and our vacation rate is up work is still unbearable. 6 nurses have quit in the last 6 months. Management did not hire to replace them because our census was down because our patients died. Now our census has grown rapidly again. We do not have the staff. I go to work and put a smile on my face. I take care of my patients. I smile and make jokes. I am a top notch nurse. I feel fine at work. Then on my day off I hit a wall. I do not want to get out of bed. I do not want to get anything done at home. Then when night falls I get upset and anxious that I have to go to work the next day. I worry about who will call out I hope no one codes I want to quit. My family tells me to quit. Find a new job but who will take care of my team and my patients? I loved my job I loved my patients but I just do not love it right now. I feel sad and disappointed in myself. Struggling with depression in my day off.,Depression

9872,First off I was in there with a guy who stayed 3 extra days because the psych forgot to give him his heart meds and switched him to Seroquel to see if his dizziness would go away. The dizziness was from her accidentally forgetting to give him his meds. That should be enough to tell you how neglectful these places are.When I was 18 I called the hotline. I said I did not want to hurt myself but needed hell. A cop knocked on my door while I was in the bathroom and took me to an ambulance 250 fee and then to the hospital got a bill that hopefully was covered by insurance and spent 24 hours on a gurney before they decided I was not a danger to myself or others and let me go. The day after my 22nd July 2nd I was on a multiday alcohol bender and attempted pills. Cops showed up and I was not compliant kept telling them to leave me alone and they kept questioning me and standing there. Apparently they were afraid of me ODing but did not bring in an EMT. Eventually they put me in handcuffs without even saying you have to come with us or we will put you in handcuffs. They also came in through the side door and unlocked front garage door which I am pretty sure is illegal. Outside I remained compliant but kept asking why I was in handcuffs. The guy cop then frisked me and touched my penis twice and after he did that I said you just touched my dick again and then he put his finger up my ass. I am serious. He degraded me in front of my entire neighborhood in broad daylight. 0 reason to. Then they put me in the backseat of a squad car and I kept asking why I was in a car in handcuffs and kept repeating I am not going to harm anyone and they said because you told us to fuck off like 20 times and we are doing what is your best interest. Riiight not rushing me to the hospital...? I think I might have been illegally detained because I did not commit a crime or make any threatening gestures and the sodomization was 100 illegal.Eventually they decided maybe the kid overdosing needs medical help so they had me get in the EMT and they strapped me to a gurney. I have no idea why they did this because I was not fighting at all or acting like I was a danger. I kept asking and they would not give me an answer. Eventually I made it to the hospital. I had my blood drawn a total of five times. I waited in the ER for 5ish hours and then got sent up to the floor for people that attempt and act out and whatnot and it was AWFUL. Close second to jail I assume. One room with nothing to do and nothing in it shit food a hallway leading to two TVs and a group room where you spend 2 hours a day max. No counselors social workers are there but rarely see you saw mine on the 5th day was supposed to be every day and a psychiatrist sees you every morning for only 510 mins.I told them that I was a prescribed Xanax addict over and over and over again and they would not give me my prescription to help with withdrawals. Withdrawals from Xanax and alcohol are extremely dangerous and can kill you. I had two seizures in there. They gave me Ativan after my first seizure well just let us know if you have a seizure and for the next few days none of the nurses knew what was going on or the psych. I kept telling them about my withdrawals and they said you are not going through withdrawals it is a benzodiazepine it is the same thing. I was crying I felt so defeated and that I would die in there. If you know how benzo WDs feel you know what I am talking about. Severe psychological distress and physical pain. 3 days in I lost control of my arm my back was arched and lost control of the muscles in my face. I could only whisper and this nurse laughed at me and walked away. She also told me my convulsing felt like my back and neck were about to snap was just a panic attack and I needed to relax. I had a seizure on the floor and the nurse said if you flop on the floor like that I am not going to give you any benzos.The patients were also traumatizing. It was awful. Just imagine a psych ward it is just how you think it is. Met a pedophile a violent methhead a tiny meth girl who would masturbate on the phone all day a couple fucking violence between patients and securitypolice emergency calls etc. and yelling all the time. did not sleep more than 3 hours a night after I got a new doctor because my psych forgot to see me one morning and he was more or less like what the fuck are they doing?. I want off Xanax so bad but it is so difficult to kick and I am so paranoid and anxious and this experience added a layer to my PTSD and my paranoia and anxiety are at an all time high. I am so afraid and I am even more depressed. The only good part is that I am coming up on 30 days sober. I feel like I was treated like an animal and I feel... I would usually use a lot of words but I just feel like a robot. I do not know what to do... guys be careful Guys be careful with the hotline and do not ever end up in a psych ward even voluntarily,Depression
38253,i m on this team project and the project manager is super toxic i constantly feel like i am a burden and that i have to pretend to be working every morning there is stand up and i have a mental breakdown because i haven t done anything i have started seeing my therapist again but i just don t know what to do about this i honestly feel like i have to quit my job but i don t have another job i am totally screwed with no way out,Depression
15274,After getting fake heartbroken today over a obsessive fantasy I had with a guy and learning he has a girlfriend I realised that all my previous trying has led to nothing but misery. I go to work and do a degree but for what? I still live with an abusive parent have cptsd am not even interested in any material goods. I wanted to get a degree so I can have my own family one day but that dream is also gone I am too mentally fucked for thatI'm going to let my body go on autopilot aka continue to go to work so nobody gets suspicious but that is it. In my free time I will just cry and rot in bed like I already do. I am 25 years old and things always end in pain and sadness for me no matter what. That 30 seconds of happiness is not worth 30 days of pain so I decide to stop trying. Letting my body go on autopilot and continue dying inside,Depression
13410,I am 33 and been suffering with depression since I was in my early teens I also have have anxiety and PTSD. I got bacterial meningitis back in 2014 so now have a TBI from it.

I am going to beat depression into a pulp,Depression

How she is heartly praying for her own death because of me. How I am wasting my dad's hard earned money how I do not even care about his health. How useless and ungrateful son I am to her and many such things. I only listened to her stayed quite. Holding out my panic attack in front of her. I know how she feels I am aware that I am a failure and unworthy person. I really blame myself every day regarding all that she spoke of. I know what she said is all true. I am the worst kid any parents could ever have. I feel extremely guilty and like every other day I wish that I was never born. I know instead of whining here like this I should actually do something productive. I am totally aware of that. I truly despise myself from the bottom of my heart. I do not know what and how I should feel. My mom just slept crying. I am completely lost. I Deserve every amount of pain I can get.,Depression

11813,A year ago I used to talk to people and express myself pretty easily and whenever Id say something the words would not feel fake or they would mean what I would say. But ever since school started last year I have become a husk of what i used to be I cannot really motivate myself to do anything at all especially communicate with others I used to have an urge to talk to others and try to be funny but it feels like I lost all of that I feel hollow constantly and I do not have any personality anymore whenever I am on call with someone it feels like I am just pretending to be an interesting person and when I run out of things to say my mind is empty and I just sit on call in silence trying to desperately think of something interesting to say or hold onto. I am talking to this girl and I feel like she is losing interest because of my nonexistent communication skills and its hurting me a lot I have lost my personality pretty much I feel like a robot or something trying to imitate a human. Please anyone with advice I need it I feel like I have lost my personality and I cannot communicate like I used to,Depression
21083,Driving home No Rain by Blind Melon came on.All I can say is that my life is pretty plain I like watching the puddles gather rain.All I can do is read a book to stay awake and it rips my life away but it is a great escape.And I do not understand why I sleep all day and I start to complain that there is no rain.All I want is someone to say to me I will always be there when you wake.I want to be there with myself when I wake... When do I get out of this cloud always hanging over my head. I am barely there I am on a T.V. Set pretending to be me in my house. Years go by everything that keeps me together breaks and comes crashing down. All I could do was cry on the driving wheel when I parked. Crying on the radio,Depression
13042,I am about ready to just give up. I have been trying to get through this depression BS for far too long now. Years of counseling and medication. Lifestyle changes including healthier diet exercising meditation. Attempts at connecting with other people. Attempts at pursuing hobbies. Going out and trying new things being active.I just cannot keep doing this anymore. I need something to change. I am lonely. I am tired. I am hopeless. Hanging on by a thread,Depression
19403,I do not want to kill myself but I feel like I have nothing to live for. I would be totally fine if I was in an accident tomorrow or even if I just faded away in my sleep tonight. I do not feel like I have any real friends. And no one would miss me. Yes I have people I talk to on a daily basis but would any of them be impacted if I was gone? No.My job would miss me the most only because there is a lot of things only I know how to do. But even there I would be eventually be replaced. I have no relationship with my family. So what is the point of living to just go through the motions? Its not like the world is a great place. Disease politics greed poverty etc just have everything getting worse every day. Like I said I do not want to kill myself. But I have given up. I want to die,Depression

18116,hi I am feeling one of the worst I have felt in my life and the older i get the more i just become hopeless. i always dream of better days and a time when I am not riddled with fears and anxiety because life could be so beautiful but i seem to only attract negativity i can not even describe the pain my soul is feeling. and i do not even know where to start but i just need to write its my only comfort at the moment as I am having severe pain in my lung from beeing a chainsmoker for years and I am daily paranoid of death or cancer. even just writing this everything is so exhausting sometimes i do not even have the power to get up and get something to drink not because I am lazy I am just so tired of life and disapointent i give all the little power i have and still without my parents and friends help I would drown for sure. as a man I am sad to know that most women are not attracted to a depressed and skinny guy and i have not had a girlfriend in 10 years... i have not hugged kissed or cuddled with a girl in 10 years and I am dying inside i just need to get it off my chest I have been thinking about sharing this on reddit for whatever reason for a longer time... and i always spoon with my pillow and imagine i have a girlfriend and everyday I am just afraid to die without ever knowing how it feels to be loved... and the pain in my lung at the moment is just scaring me to death id be happy if someone would just chat with me a little thank you if you have read the whole post i appreciate it my friend Hopeless,Depression

23953,I am sure that people have been through much more than I am right now. However this currently is about me and my not being able to handle the situation. I will try to list out my life just because I want to share them with someone.I am a young guy 26 years of age in a dead end IT job. Over the last 2 years I have gained huge amount of weight and I feel like shit because of my body. The pandemic has been a tough time for me personally. I have not been able to handle the pandemic and have relapsed to alcohol and overeating.So below are the stressors of my life1. Being a IT worker I sit around all day swamped with work. My work involves client interactions and while I try to be polite today I just broke down. The job is the biggest stressor. I spend 12 hours a day working and interacting with very rude people. 2. I need to lose weight. I have connected with a personal diet coach. However I am not able to follow through with the steps she wants me to take. I feel so disappointed with myself because of it.3. Being in this dead end job will be very harmful for my career. I need to study and change to a different portfolio within IT. I take interviews regularly. Yesterday I was lined up for a dream job. I felt prepared after having spent many months reviewing and learning all of the required concepts. Sadly I was rejected. 4. I have a decent salary but I have friends who do not respect money. Most of my money goes to bailing them out from their financial disasters. In the end I feel like I am losing money all the time. My own financial position is not something to be proud of. I have no money saved up for emergency or if I end up losing my job.I feel I have too much on my plate sometimes and I cannot do all of this at once. I have been failing to make progress on any of the problems for the past 2 years and I feel depressed due to this fact. Solution to all my problems is taking action but I cannot do what is needed,Depression

25864,I have been feeling lazy as hell. I work from home and I have been addicted to youtube videos. I do not even enjoy these videos. I just watch them while working but I can barely focus. Maybe I will get fired soon. I also stopped working out even though my garage gym is seconds away from my home office. I started getting fat. I have also been spending over 2k on escorts this year. I have just feel like shit. I even drove to the grocery store one night just to buy 3 family sized bags of potato chips. As soon as I got home I feel massive regret. What the hell is wrong with me? Everything I do seem out of character than who I was a year ago... Am i depressed? What is wrong with me?,Depression
8538,Just 19 and I am already not seeing the point in anything. Going to university feels necessary and like the worst decision ever I am losing my hair so I will not even have love in my life I am short people suck games do not hit as hard as they used to and everyone is having more funsexprogressenjoyment than I am.Why am I even here at this point If only I knew it want to going to be this way,Depression
27224,My father does not give a shit about my struggles. He just compares mine to his. About how he did not have a bed no closet no computers not even a ball to play with blah blah blah. Then he goes and says all you have to fucking worry about isthe meaning of life. that is your biggest problem I am so fucking speechless. Hes only telling that because one time when I was young I asked him what is the meaning of life out of curiousity. Guess he could not answer that question so he shamed me for asking. Last night he told me that yes you have struggles and you should just own it. Own your self harm scars. FUCKING hypocrite. You never gave a fuck did you? All of those things you said were bullshit to make you look like a good parent. Guess what? You fucking signed up for this. You signed up for a mentally ill kid. You signed up for any fucking problems. Because you fucking wanted a kid. You took the gamble and now you got one. Happy? You are not the fucking victim. This fucking hurt me. Your own father saying that. You were the one selfish enough to have a kid in the middle of a fucking war. You saw all the fucking misery and the world and decided to put me through it. I cannot wait for this circus to be over. You were the one selfish enough to have me in the middle of a fucking war.,Depression

21306,I thought I was getting betterI do not know if any of you have watched Ozark but at one point the bipolar guy talks about how he like wakes up one day and it is like oh I remember now how I feel or something like that I do not think I am bipolar but I really relate to that part. it is like I am doing alright for a while but only because for some reason I do not really get to feel my emotions and then it flips back and I remember that I am still depressedthis is kind of fucked but I spend a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if some serial killer took out my entire extended family and I could either live alone and do whatever or just end it without making anyone else sad yknow but also that would ruin me so it would almost certainly be the latter not again,Depression
16350,I am 35 and have struggled with depression off and on my entire adult life. I feel like I should not be though. I grew up poor and struggled hard with money through college but now I am stable and have a job I love a group of friends and hobbies. The thing that is eating me up inside is I have been single and alone my entire adult lifenobody has ever even shown enough interest for even a second date let alone a relationship. There are times where this has not bothered me but this last year it shifted and now feels like an insurmountable failure. it is worn me down to an unimaginable degree and is robbing me of joy in the other parts of my life. I am not sure what changed or how to get back to where I was before. I would appreciate any help or advice I can get. I am not sure where to start...,Depression

7873,So I am not exactly capable of getting mental health help since I am in the weird bracket on pay where I make too much but not enough at the same time. I have tried for over a year very diligently to figure out what is exactly wrong since I have felt out of place since my relationship of 3 years ended it ended in 2015 I know forever ago my wife passed away a year ago and the circumstances were just to give me a fat middle finger on her way out. I do not understand where to start to begin what I am feeling but it is not happiness it is painful and it is nerve wrecking. Where do you begin?,Depression
24343,I do not want to be a nazi I do not want to be a Hindu nationalist or an ethnonationalist. I have been born and raised in a right wing family like racist dad and everythingwere not white. My dad has openly said some stuff to people that would not go down well and I do not want to be forced into being a nazi. He wants me to join the rssIndian kkk but more larger and powerful. The RSS is a Hindu nationalist organization its like white nationalist but Indian. I do not want that I want to be able to love someone who is not racially similar. God this sucks so much. I was dating somebody who happen to be white and I think I rly rly likes her. I would say loved her but I am only 17. I hurt her and made her cry for days when I told her I did not want to be with her but I did want her. Honestly I think I loved her. She still tries to talk to me but I pull away because I know its wrong to be with her. My father would not approve and might disinherit me if he found out. I am stuck and suffocating. I am depressed. I have nothing to look forward to.,Depression
17199,I am so tired. I have always been indifferent about being alive and think of suicide passively pretty much constantly but I am starting to not want to be alive anymore. I am just so tired i do not think i want to be alive anymore,Depression
47817,tired what is your reaction when people vent or tell their pathetic and sad life to you ?like for example they live in the street or whatever and they ask you what u would do if that was you and youre so weak that youre already laughing at how QUICKLY you wouldve kys in this situation ?? like you dont even do it on purpose but u laugh because your life is objectively so much less tragic but youre kinda like bro I could nevaaaaah bc i feel like this 100 of the time i cant do the easiest thing ? like just go out and study for more than 2 months without encountering situations that just proves me i dont belong in this societyworld ? im so so so tired but theres a fucking thing that just tolds me i dont deserve to die but i mean thats a lie everyone deserves it especially meidk what to do to not suffer and not kms ? i dont like anything anymore ive been thinking the same thing since im 15 i dont have a passion dont have a purpose and im fucking angry with everyoneim actually really jealous of people getting out of depression because thats what shows theyre normal ppl that are getting sad when something v sad happens to them.its not my case i dont like this world and i dont wanna live in it.idk it makes me sick to see ppl wake up everyday to do things i will never ever want to do in my life.???like wtf you obtain by watching sunsets and walking and just wake up everyday ? its boring. theres no purpose wtf im so pissed rn.sometimes i even picture myself in if i would have lived the same way as my parents and I KNOW I WOULD KILL MYSELF INSTANTLY. i dont picture myself to be happy ever.i even have a boyfriend for 3 years now and im even more sad. the only thing that makes my life a little better is drugs music porn alcohol and sex and since i have a boyfriend sex is so boring and even now that we are in a open relationship i dont even have the motivation to see people i used to live for flirting with guys before i really had nothing else that made me feel goodnow idk i just feel like a depressive person going through a depression ?sometimes i cant even get out of bed to roll a joint bc i have no strengthi dropped out of school a lot and i have nothing to offer to this word officially bc unofficially i know im smart i know how to help people i could have made myself useful but 1 ppl dont let me show them bc i have no diplomas or anything to show them my worth 2 even tho ppl want me somewhere i end up burn out int and disappearing bc deep down i dont wanna live this life. PERIODalso i have a very strong sense of value and i find so fucking pathetic the fact that anyone can just THINK theyre smart and could be useful while being actually just a loser all their life. as an example my boyfriend which is even dumber than me is always thinking he can be rich and can enter any school thanks to me he knows he set his expectations too high but he believes he can get rich af without KNOWING A SINGLE NOTION IN FINANCE OR BUSINESS COURSES ??? he doesnt even have a GED equivalent at 22 and their friends and even parents says thinking is not his specialtylike wtf thats why im also so mad at him bc hes disposed to be a loser but unlike me hes happy like a fucking moron ??? idk thats just too much now he wants to go live abroad. AND GUESS WHAT.that stupid moron never ever thought about that in his entire life so he doesnt know any other cultures or languages except our french and he still thinks he can get a job in a country like Singapore Canada Switzerland The US ?????!!!!anyway hes a pure reflection of how much my life is a disaster. mentally he is the opposite of what ive ever wanted and supported ? even politically hes just following the trends he believes what anybody says as long as its in a video.anyway i wanna die but i dont even hate him enough to do that to him.i feel pity for him but im the one whos sad wtf,Depression
47178,Confused about reason So at the current time in my reality I finished school around 2 years ago and have been jobless since I've been living with my family. The days have become dull and timewasting I feel like my time sleeping and dreaming is more fulfilling and lively for me than being awake... When I wake up I turn on my computer and if I'm not doing something with my family I'll sit for 1214 hours a day with breaks of making food and stuff... Everything has become obscurely pointless I feel like I'm wasting my life on temporary things... A part of me just wants to stay in the dark and discover the vast illusion of suffering while the other part wants to start and become something grand. I despise how society is built everything feels so complex and demanding. Many times again I've wished that the world was of a past era a downgrade if you will where economy complexity orderliness greed and money wasn't discovered. Anyways probably gonna feel better tomorrow.,Depression
13087,I would love to hire a hitman to kill me. I feel like it would take some of the hurt away from others if they thought it was not by my own hand.I cannot keep pretending everything is fine for much longer. I just want to die. I do not want to be here.,Depression
11796,I am having trouble sleeping so I thought I would just vent hereI just graduated from junior college and now have to serve a compulsory 2 years in the army. So now is the time for me to think about what I want to study in universityJunior College really burned me out and I do not feel really passionate about anything other than comics and film. I have tried to reignite an interest in coding but I just feel so uninterested and defeated.The reason why I particularly like film is because you get to create content in our increasingly consumerismcentric society. I also want to work on comic adaptations because I just love these storiesMany people in life they encourage you to chase your passion and I want to but I feel like work experience is much more useful to get myself into the film industry. I seriously have little faith in the film school route what if I spend 35 years getting a film degree and still struggling to find a job especially in my country where the film industry is tinyAlso since the film industry here is so tiny coming across opportunities to work in the film industry after my 2 years of army service...seems hardI just feel so empty. My only real passion in life now is comics and film. I do not have that many friends to share joy withAnd I am just sad I feel empty not very interested in almost all career options. Only really interested in film. Yeah.,Depression
40288,i have two younger brother and they mean everything to me they ve come to an age where they can take care of themselves my excuse for not hurting myself wa them but now they started to grow distant and honestly every single piece of my life ha fallen apart even my mind feel torn a i realized i m becoming crazy i m having lot of harmful thought towards others i really don t want to harm anyone and i rather end my life before i do any harm but i don t want my suicide to make my brother fall into depression a i did i have 0 motif to be alive i do not like this world i do not like most of it s people everyone betrayed me and there s no one that give a shit about me anymore besides my brother i feel like i really have to do it i know i have to i just lack the ball this might be the cruelest thing to say in this reddit but i admire the courage of those that did suicide it s not easy and it s not the coward way the coward way is probably to keep living a i am this ha to stop,Depression
15168,I just got pushed down more and they just told me my opinion does not matter. Like bitch I am also part of this family if you do not like me just kill me as if i ever enjoyed your company. I just for once tried opening up with people and got out of my she will but people just hate me and i just got pushed down more. when you ask your kid to open up for years and then one day finally he tries opening up you just push him down further congratulations. Just giving me more reasons to remain in my she will depressed and to hate them and myself just have to now live life like this till the point i break because they are never going to change.In this past week i already lost my best friend. I am just useless i could not even save her how am i supposed to save myself. I just hate myself Today i finally tried talking more with my family and tried to open up and guess what,Depression
40296,i have come to the conclusion that i am just not suited for life no matter how hard i try i don t seem to be able to accomplish anything meaningful or be able to derive joy out of anything i wa given nice parent and a privileged upbringing but the extreme depression that rule my life is overwhelming and i really can not take it anymore i have an easy life and i still can t manage to get it right i started to feel worthless ever since i wa a teenager i had a hard fitting in with group of people i felt extremely shy and i saw that my best friend at the time could effortlessly blend in and have many friend it completely baffled me and it wa the first time that i started telling myself over and over i am not pretty i have no talent i am not smart i am worthless year old me cried myself to sleep convinced that people just simply didn t like me i could never quite figure out what wa defective in me everywhere i went i felt extremely awkward and felt in high school i started to feel immense academic pressure i saw that my classmate were very high achieving i didn t even want to think about my future and i spent much of my time last minute studying and playing video game instead of planning anything for my future i ended up not getting into college that i wanted to while my friend and classmate were accepted i accepted that i wa a failure compared to everyone in my high school a socially awkward talentless ugly failure i went to university i am now doing a master with an internship i graduated with summa cum laude for my undergraduate i wa still constantly cry and contemplating the worth of my pathetic life still i wa able to appear smart in front of my classmate i took up a research internship a well where i wa again told that i wa smart and had a lot of potential and other b but aside from school i didn t have much of a life any friend i made in uni have long been lost because people don t like being around a depressed person i wa made out to be toxic so that alone should tell you enough how awful it is to be around me i went to therapy it didn t do much i took medication it doesn t do much i have now entered my master program and i am being told by my supervisor that she ha serious doubt a to whether i will pas everyone else is enjoying their time in their study while i have to struggle so hard just to be told that i m not even good enough to get a passing grade i also struggle extremely badly with body dysmorphic disorder i have a pear shaped body no matter how much i exercise my leg just stay very bulky and thick i lost a lot of weight in my last year of my undergraduate study it wa partly because i hated my body but above all it wa because i hated my life so much that i wanted to make it visible by appearing sickly thin i continued to lose weight until i wa underweight only then do my leg appear normal i continued to follow disgusting anorexic eating pattern during my study it wa so damn hard to study while having to be pre occupied with food and having to only eat calorie in order to not gain weight somehow i passed all my damn exam after this year i admitted to my parent that i had an eating disorder although at this point it wa kind of evident i went home to take a gap year for the sake of my mental health during my gap year i sought professional treatment and of course i gained a ton of weight i wa so sick of living with severe depression and anorexia it wa near traumatic to see my body change so much in a short amount of time i felt extremely defective for gaining so much weight i can t believe my parent thought it would be a good idea for me to recover at home instead of at a ed treatment center because my emotional volatility were simply insane but i became physically healthy and i wa eating lot of good food i even got a part time job during my gap year to convince myself that i wa at least semi functional unfortunately a is the case with my pear shaped body living at a normal weight entail lot and lot of misery i can never wear skinny jean because my leg are ugly i can t stand the cellulite and belly fat that accompanies my healthy body i wa handed bad genetics in term of body build my body alone take away my will to live after my gap year i continued onto my master i started to lose some weight just because i slept through some snack and meal from fatigue and then i knew that i could never gain that weight back i started to take up lot of exercising to create more room for extra food the vast majority of my classmate are thin people being bigger than everyone is extremely triggering for me everyday i wake up and think about what i m going to eat then i think about how big my leg are then i think about how much thinner and smarter and classmate are then i see all the thin people around me then i think about what i m going to eat next then i think about how i m going to fit a jog or a boxing class into my busy schedule then maybe i will think about school and such then i go to sleep and repeat it all again i even lost my damn period again it s maddening because i am not even a thin person and yet my body think that being slightly thinner mean that i m necessarily dying i have such a dumb body now here i am doing an internship for school and i am failing very badly it s not in my native language and i haven t known the language for very long so it cost me twice the cognitive energy to follow everything apparently taking exam go smoothly but the minute i have to be in a practical setting i turn into a complete idiot i don t have the extra energy to put in the effort because most of my dumb thought are just my leg are fat her leg are thin she is lucky i have to worry about weight lunch is when jogging when extra squat when what s for dinner etc now i m constantly being told that i m not performing well and they can t tell if it s because of a language barrier or if i genuinely don t understand what is going on everyone else is doing just fine and they say that you have to be pretty stupid to fail at this internship well guess who s going to be that idiot who can t pas looking back at my life i just see failure and mediocracy and just a lot of sadness a i said earlier my body alone take away my will to live but in order to be able to function in school and work you need to stay relatively healthy but seeing a my life is just filled with social isolation inferiority complex and still lot of depression there is just simply no way that my life is worth it living in this healthy body make me extremely sad and the life that i would otherwise have without an ed is just not worth it it doesn t justify the effort i put into recovery and the effort i put in with learning to accept my body seeing a my life is just consisting of studying feeling stupid feeling incompetent cry exercising restrictive eating hunger fatigue and more cry i just wonder how the hell everyone else is just out here living a normal life without any mental illness people like my classmate are really out here acing their exam acing their internship having a life having lot of friend having a relationship having fun and leading overall fulfilling life i don t understand it all i know is that my life wa just one big mistake i just really need a good plan on how to end myself i find it disappointing how finding a simple method with a high success rate just isn t very easy i have four more week in my internship i just plan to go through it get an insufficient grade and then end it all but ugh mom and dad would be so sad it s already bad enough that i tell them that i hate living and wish that i could disappear they try so hard to convince me that i m smart and can accomplish anything i want like i m in a disney movie they constantly try to convince me that i will find happiness in my life and that i m just in a low state of my life and that they will always be there and try to find further help for me but i m i ve been feeling this way for over a decade damn near half my dumb existence i feel like my soul died the minute i hit puberty i didn t experience anything traumatic i wa just dealt a bad hand in genetics i m freaking exhausted nothing would be better than closing my eye and never waking up again,Depression

16736,Hi I hope that you are okay.I am not unfortunately. Its the second depressive episode of my life and idk if Ill survive this one.I have abandonment trauma and each time a separation occurs I get depressed. The more attached the worse.My first episode happened 4 years ago and was due to leaving high school and my home town.My therapist my family and friends helped me through. But the one who helped me the most was my boyfriend. I always thought that I would never meet a guy like those in books. And yet I did. The second we started talking I knew he was special. How odd a feeling.During three years and a half I grew better alongside him. I started loving life in its smallest forms like insect and seeds learnt almost everything I know about nature and started caring about myself to take better care of others. If there is anything such as soulmates in this world he is mine. Yet due to that covid nightmare and my failing at passing a specific exam we have lived apart since March 2020 and he could not bear it. I have not been the best GF in a distance relationship since I have a strong sense of imagination which made me feel like he was with me in the new city I lived in and the discrepancy between our dealing with distance cost us our story. Ever since our breakup 4 months ago my life has been nothing but a nightmarish roller coaster which does not provide any fun at all. The worse in that is that I know that he will not be willing to try again for as long as I am in that state which no one would this is the healthy logical thing to do and I do not know how to get out of that state without him.It is not that I need his help to get better but rather that our being apart hurts way too much. And now that my grandad is about to die I am seriously wondering how I will not go even more berserk and completely ruin my last chances of getting back with him. I am seeing therapists taking meds doing the things that I love activism reading writing and drawing playing music seeing my friends and family and even opening up to new relationships and flirting with cute guys. Yet nothing helps. I am feeling more depressed than ever. Sorry for the long sad and useless talk. Yet if anyone has any kind of pieces of advice to give me Id truly appreciate it. Take care lt3 Life feels like the worst of a rollercoaster and a haunted house combined.,Depression
27211,No matter how many connections I make I can never break the barrier and find someone I actually feel connected too.. ampx200BI feel like no one on this planet understands me. All I really want is to give and reciprocate all the love I hold in my life. ampx200BI cannot make friends.. and every man I meet just wants to hook up. I have so much pure kindness in my heart and no one to give it to. I think that is why I love animals... ampx200BI am drunk and very depressed. My meds help suppress it a bit but my life is very wrong.. I was not mean to be so alone. No one is. There are so many people around me and I cannot find someone who gets me???

17491,I grew up very lonely. Was mainly close to my grandmother and grandfather. My grandmother was always near death but she always rallied. She really likes being alive. I think back on how happy she was to see me all the time. she is been dead for like 25 years. I think about her a lot. Sometimes I feel like making her happy by being around was the only thing I was ever good at. My mother is getting older and I feel the same way about her. When she is gone I will not have anything to feel good about. It scares me. I think about my dead grandmother a lot. Even more when I feel depressed.,Depression
26313,I really do not understand my family is... Ok they do not bully me or abuse me they are supportive and try to help sometimes and I am fucking useless! So good people.But when I talk with any member of my family or hear their voices sometimes my fingers literally curl i feel the urge to scratch my arms and I start being suicidal which I am even without them and it is not because of them but my family really makes me wish I did not exist. when I am ignored and it feels like no one knows I exist I relax.At this point I really do not know what is wrong with me. I mean i want to kill myself sure but the way I react to family members bothers me more than wanting to die it makes me panic and fills my head with unwanted thoughts. And it is very very stressful Talking to my family makes me suicidal,Depression
47333,I dont want to get medically diagnosed for depression Im honestly afraid to get check cause what if im actually not suffering from depression? So am I just feeling sad and lonely this whole time? That makes it a lot worse.,Depression

15417,Hi. How can I get myself motivated to work? I lost my job in December after working there for a year. Before that I had a job that I hated and got laid off from there too. I have never had a jobcareer I liked. they are all terrible even tho I think I am a good employee. I have awards to prove it. Ever since I got laid off aside from having UI and medical issues I have been doing ok. I have actually lost the weight I gained at my prev jobs. I just do not want to work ever. I have had a few interviews that I have sabotaged because I cannot bear the thought of being miserable at my job and being more miserable by moving out of LA. I have an interview at 8am tomorrow for a job that I just got laid off from and I could care less about it. I have not prepped at all.I justcant. But I know sooner or later I need to do something. Not motivated to work,Depression
47296,Sometimes emptiness is harder than feeling something Just feel like a bag of bones doin nothing in my life cause I always felt like I wont fit anywhere.At least I hate this world society humans. The school system destroyed me but I did my best to persevere and try to go the furthest I could.But now that Im considered as an adult in this world I just feel too different to achieve anythingand my opinions political or philosophical are just making me so sure about the fact that getting the life that everybody already has having a work getting paid consuming for your pleasure your needsbeing officially included in this consumer society as a consumer won't fix anything.I couldnt even enjoy my childhood same with my teenage years.How am I supposed to have the strength to at least have hope for adulthood? Im too tired this world is sicka huge amount of people in this planet talk about happiness as if it were more present than misery. I can't stand this hypocrisy anymore.Its making me feel ,Depression

39369,it happens a lot when i dissociate at least i have been all day and everything seems like it s moving at the speed of light my whole body feel dizzy and shaky too because i slept hour the main cause of me dissociating today and sometimes it ll randomly feel like everything is going super slow and it feel like i m like stuck in quick sand or something trying to move forward and do stuff but something keep pulling me back,Depression
18551,I do not really know what I did wrong. My family and very few friends do not like me at all. I have one cousin who shows any interest in me but other than that everyone just fucking hates me. I guess it is my fault for being such a worthless oxygen wasting piece of shit who contributes nothing. I was not born with any kind of talent nor good looks or intelligence in any field. It would have been nice to have either looks or smarts considering most people have at least one of those and everyone at my school has both. it is frustrating seeing everyone around me being literally perfect in every way. I am only happy in my own mind where I imagine myself as someone else. I am such a degenerate incel clown looking bastard. But luckily I have a bunch of fucked up health stuff going on so nature will probably take its course soon. I suck.,Depression
14255,There are several times throughout the day where my depressionmood gets so bad it physically hurts being alive. I just wanted to know if anyone else feels the same. I also cannot concentrate during these moments and can no longer really enjoy anything. My friends and family know about this but even with all the support I am fortunate to have I feel like I am screwed and my brain is breaking down. Is it normal for depression to be THAT bad?,Depression
14066,Its my fault I was used its my fault I was not sexual enough. My ocd is fake because I use it as an excuse. 16? you are not in any mental pain you are too young. All I do is get dismissed when I tell people I was used for sex and my age mean I have 0 pain. Yes I am young yes this is nothing but its still there the feeling is real 16 or not. I wish someone would just acknowledge that and not ignore it honestly just need someone to talk to Ig. My pain is fake,Depression

10265,Yeah depression sucks but what if instead of talking about the shit that sucks in our lives we spoke about everything that goes right. I have been trying to take my Ws when they come rarely do and it seems to be working to an extent. Just an idea.. it can be called Verbalization. If of course it does not already exist New Thread,Depression
19968,I do not use reddit at all but I just wanted to share what I am going through and hopefully someone can take time to read this and reply because I do need some type of support from another person. I am 19 and I have always had underlying issues like anxiety or this impending sadness that I have always pushed to the side growing up as a teen because my parents have never even talked about mental health. I even was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid but my mom has a huge stigma on mental health and told the doctors I am just a kid. I thought it was normal that growing up I would get extremely nervous before doing anythingsimple tasks. I also would get distracted so easily and was never able to sit down and do work at schoolhome. My mom was also emotionally abusive at times and would rarely hit me but when she did its over things that she should not be putting her hands on me for. Thinking about it high school was a dark time for me but at the time I did not feel that bad about it until it caught up to me after i graduated. My mom is a great mother but she has never listened to my opinion and has always kept me in a box. She was a helicopter mom checking what I do all the time and this led me to have little to no social life in high school. Also my highschool was so sick and twisted I could go into a whole other post about it. I kept telling my mom to take me out of that school but of course she never listened and forced me to go to a school with only about 200300 students. The students all acted way younger than there age. The seniors would act like 6th graders and it was just such a weird and confusing environment. I am very angry at my mom but I do love her immensely so When I turned 18 that is when a lot of my issues caught up with me. I was unhappy and unable to even speak to people. My anxiety became worse when i would start shaking before even speaking to somebody. I started to notice that the friends and the people i knew at the time are not what I am looking for in friends. I do not know if that is my depression making me think all my friends are not people i want to be around but regardelsss i pushed everyone away. While going through such a horrible phase my 18 year was hell. My mom thought i was changing and being cold when in reality i was just really really down. She made me feel bad for the way i was feeling and still does till this day. I had no social life or any friends because i pushed everyone away. One positive about my 18 year is i finally found my passion but i wish i discovered myself earlier. I also have zero idea how to start. Now I am 19 and my anxiety and depression have become debilitating. I quit my job and I am in my room all the time with no contact with ppl besides my online friends i was in my room all the time in high school too. I have now become distant to my family and i feel so distant from everybody. I have daily intrusive and very sad thoughts 247. I am already getting therapy but i feel so bad at times. I right now cannot imagine myself having a job or going to college. It almost seems impossible to me. I Also judge people so much and think that I am above others in my head but i truly know its because I am unhappy with myself. my mom is extremely judgmental too so its hard for me to do things i like without her judging me. I just need someone to talk to Ill try to reply but i might forget i even wrote this post or be too nervous to reply. I need advice about my my mental healthsocial life what I am interested in and about my old friends in which i pushed away out of both my own choice and my mental health. I do not know where to get started. Just need to speak about what I am going through Long post,Depression
23619,All I am doing is trying to get better trying harder But nothing helpsNo amount of pillsNo amount of supportNo amount of therapyAnd I just do not feel aliveAnd every time I am alone I break Over and over againBut I cannot tell anybodyI try to compensate by being cheerful And it worksEverybody thinks I am doing better than the last monthsTruth is I am contemplating drinking suicide giving upAnd I just do not feel like fighting anymoreI feel like breaking down all the timeI run off to the toilet to cryMy psychiatrist is taking me off my antidepressants I do not know how I am going to do thisI cannot liveAnd everybody expects me to be an adult now but I feel more helpless than everI just cannot live like this Life seems so pointless right now,Depression
12492,Because all my friends are either busy or also depressed and even suicidal like me. Because no one understands and that makes me resent them more.Because they do not know how to help which only makes me feel worse.Because they turn it around and make it about themselves.This is too much for anyone untrained to deal with not even therapists do much to help and I really hate feeling like a burden and frustrating people. I hate feeling selfish. I am still just waiting to die. My physical health keeps worsening so perhaps I can bet on that. Why do not you reach out to someone?,Depression
20045,It gives you insomnia which in turn makes your depression worse during the day which messes up your sleep even more which gives you anxiety. It just feels impossible to function. what is even worse is when I cannot sleep my symptoms of my ocd and anxiety are just 50x worse. It feels impossible to escape depressuon,Depression
25471,Sometimes i feel like commiting suicide is the answer so that i would not be worried about my future I am younglonely and i am afraid of the future. Am i going to be worse or am i just going to suffer,Depression
26825,i keep swaying back and forth and tears keep filling my eyes i have never been so alone in my whole life. i never thought id be alone like this and isolated it is a constant battle to hold the tears back and not feel like just laying down and going to sleep i feel so tired and just give up nobody wants anything to do with me or wants to be my friend i feel so invisible i do not want to be around anymore do not want to live this same repeating day over and over again of constantly being alone anymore. somebody please talk to me acknowledge i exist please I am begging you anybody. i do not know what to do anymore I am lost and so alone,Depression
10705,Depression is an old friend at this point. I do not even remember what its like for my brain to be normal. That said its been getting a lot darker these days and so I guess I am hoping putting this out there helps or something. I do not know what the hell to do anymore.To shorten a very long story I am a single dad stuck at home 100 of the time with 3 kids. Ex left me for a old boyfriend sucked but whatever I got over it. I was able to work from home and help take care of the kids keep things normalish. Thank God for my parents. Without their help Id have gone insane or more likely put a bullet in my mouth a long time ago.Things were going ok ish until covid. Suddenly the kids are stuck home all the time bored and driving me crazy. Their mom is flaking out again so I am without much help. My oldest son is a nightmare. Long gone is the sweet boy I knew and hes replaced with a narcissistic psychopath. Yeah yeah I know all teenagers are bad but no. I legitimately use the clinical definition of psychopath here. I 100 think hes about one life crisis away from the beginning of a Netflix true crime documentary on a serial killer.We tried therapy but it does not help. Hes a master at lying deflecting and putting on whatever mask he thinks will work best for you at this moment. After the 3rd time he did not come home and the cops brought him back we had him go to an inpatient facility for teens. We all breathed a collective sigh. Finally peace for us and maybe just maybe he will get some help. Nope a few weeks later hes back and has not changed.For a while he was able to live with his mom most of the time. But her new marriage imploded and now she is quasi homeless. Great now I am back to them all being here 100 of the time no end in sight. My parents can take the younger 2 for brief stints but cannot handle him nor do I want them to have to.So here I sit at my kitchen table staring down the barrel of at least 5 more years of this shit. I have a nicer prison than most I guess. Still able to work buy shit for hobbies that I do not give a shit about anymore sunlight and fresh air.I do not actually want to kill myself but dark thoughts are no stranger and I am getting more comfortable with not being alive. Even started thinking about what ifs for after I am gone. The only comfort I get these days is eating so I figure my heart will give out within the next decade and solve the problem for me if things do not change.Well there it is there is my story and yeah I do not feel any better. Hell I am not sure why I thought I would. I do not feel period these days. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk or something. Trapped,Depression
19107,I think I am depressed. I decided to type out and share some of my feelings and thoughts in order to get them off my chest and to hopefully receive some helpful advice or encouraging words from one of the people reading this.I was raised as a Christian and I was a believer until my early teenage years. Then a relative of mine passed away very suddenly from cancer. She was still in her thirties. It made no sense to me. She was a very generous sweet hospitable warm and loving woman. It made me question if there is a god and why he would allow something like this to happen to such a good person. The death of my relative turned me into a bit of a hedonist. My reasoning Why would I do tedious things if something like this can happen to anyone? What is the point in studying for a boring test when I could die tomorrow? I knew that the chances of me dying were slim but there are never guarantees.Then I identified as an agnostic atheist for a few years before I finally became an atheist a few years ago. I am now at a point where I believe our existence is merely a coincidence. We are just descendants of monkeys on a tiny blue rock and the unfortunate tragedy is that we can reflect on our own existence. I am the kind of person who tries to make sense of everything. I usually try to be as unbiased as possible and to use facts in order to form my opinion. That is why it is so hard for me to come to terms with the fact that life is very unfair and random.By making smart choices living healthily working hard etc. you can only increase your chances of living a good life but there are no guarantees. Our 1 and only life is a game of chance which is a truth that is hard for me to fathom.The state of the world pisses me off too. Why the fuck is there still racism? Why are LGBTQIA people still being treated unfairly? Why are we allowing capitalism overconsumption and greed to completely destroy our planet? Why are there billionaires? Why are millions of people starving while others care about buying the latest clothes and gadgets? How am I supposed to care about school when these problems still exist? Perhaps I am just a sensitive little bitch idk.Speaking of being a bitch I fucking love my parents and I cannot stomach that someday they will die. I start crying even just thinking about losing them at some point in the future. I genuinely believe they are some of the best human beings on the earth. I have thought about suicide but I do not think I would be able to do that to my parents who are my everything. So the harsh reality is that either I will lose them or they will lose me. So if I do not want to commit suicide it is inevitable that I will lose my parents at some point if I manage to live that long and that I will have to continue to live life on a planet full of greed and hate. A life that is inextricably linked to suffering. I have heard people say time and time again that life IS suffering but even when that is seen as a universal truth that does not mean that it becomes easier to accept that truth. That truth does not suddenly become easier to bear.I have briefly read about Camus and the myth of Sisyphus and while I agree with his worldviews and the absurdity of life I cannot really see myself following the example of Sisyphus. I cannot see how I could accept having to roll the boulder up the hill for the rest of my life.For a few years the idea of building a legacy intrigued me. What if I could make art or start institutions that could stand the test of time. My name would be cemented in history. Then I had a shocking realisation. When I die I will not be there to enjoy the legacy I built. I do not know what to do. I still enjoy sports hedonism and other forms of escapism but only because they allow me a temporary escape from life's inherent suffering. Perhaps I am a 'pussy' or a 'coward' but I honestly cannot take it anymore. This existence is overwhelming. Fed up with this unfair and cruel world and life's inherent suffering,Depression
14103,Mine is not a sad tragic one. My mom is an okay woman with good intentions and like the old saying goes good intentions pave the road to hell. She got out of poverty and found a good job was not so successful with my fatherlost to another woman but in South Africa being fatherless is pretty much a character trait everybody has. I have a sister with ADHD so to prevent my sister from acting up she is strict on us. But she also has a strict background so it is in the genes.I am 16 male and depressed not as bad as I used to be 2 year ago but I am no optimist who tells everyone it gets better because really it do not. My depression does not root itself in traumatic events and the lack of friends I have loving friends and though i have been through some sexual shit at a young age I do not take it too seriously. I got depressed because I questioned previous my religionChristianity I am not atheist i believe there is a Gods but he is not the over glorified bloke in the Bible too many facts about the world points out that he wanted the world fucked up and humans or demons are not the bad guys here. Anyway I got pressed life became meaning less and all my dreams of ministering to the world just went to shit. I saw no more reason to live. And it was a downward spiral from there on out. I went back to watching porn and being addicted to it using the little data got every month hoping my mom could get that uncapped shit so I fap to all the pawgs out there I isolated myself a lot and contemplated self harm but my fear of sharp objects refused I tread down that path and refusing to hear any of that positivity bs. You know the usual's.Then I smoke weed and discovered my interest in art. I fell in love with how artists could portray concepts into simple but deep drawings and paintings. I personally liked non paint art it just gets me. Art led me to philosophy which then led be to listening to that positive bs which led me to listening to people and appreciating their existence without forcing my ideals and experience onto them this led me to storytelling and there I fell in love with writing drawing and mildly socialising. Before I stopped masturbating and I was actually happy. Still I pushed philosophical thoughts and realised that nothing is as big as I had made it out to be and the little dark box i put myself in was non existent.Then my mothers good intentions kicked in. My grades started fluctuating to to my attention being drawn away from school. When my attention was drawn back to school I saw it for the farce it was. It barely taught us anything I brought in so much invisible pressure to kids and was just abuse to the teachers who have to baby sit 40 children in a class. School sucked not to mention that textbooks keep repeating the shit they said the previous years and could easily be replaced by youtube and google. When I realised this I told my mom about it hoping she would hear me out on my art thing but she called me names and said I was spewing nonsense. She meant well honestly she did not want me being poor or homeless but i do not see myself being rich either. All I want is to draw and tell stories i do not really care about anything else. Then back came my depression I was drawing less still making up stories in my head but then i started beating myself up for not drawing. Schools are reopening soonI am online btw finally got that uncapped shit which means less drawing. I do not want to be a robot that just gets the A's without learning anything but my moms not seeing it she is putting more pressure on me ensuring i have no me time. Right now I am contemplating suicide that way I do not feel the pain of school anymore any before you give me the suicide hurts your loved ones speech just remember that you get what you give so if my loved ones give pain then they will get it.I do not want to be rebellious and be a prick there is no way I am running away now winter nights are just too cold. summers coming though and I am not about to put in effort into something that drains me again. What do I do redditors. Advise me should just end me or should I walk the path of pain.? My apologies if the text is too long I just needed you guys to be well informed before advising me. I need advice.,Depression
19021,I feel like I wish I had somebody to love. I wish the ones I loved before have not hurt me. I feel like depression would be easier to go through with someone else I feel like the one I love would be the one to get me there. But every time every single time I fall back into the same hole. I get hurt by the one I want to have something with every time I feel like I potentially have someone I can date it never works out. It is so hard for me to like someone and when I do nothing ever good comes for me out of it. I see all my friends have more success in their love lives my ex girlfriend hurt me hurt me bad. I was emotionally held hostage and abused emotionally. She played me like a band a band of instruments. I try so hard and got so far but in the end it does not even matter. Its the same shit every fucking time even if my future girlfriend and I have problems I would rather go through those than not have anyone at all. Fuck this shit bro its sad life is hard sometimes but I get up and put up a fight every day because I have too much to live for. Am I alone on this?,Depression
40904,may 9th and september th are the worst day of the year for me and may in coming up so fast i feel the depression kicking in,Depression
47613,Am I Depressed Without Realizing Im Depressed? Okay this may seem like a dumb question to a lot of you but just hear me out and please keep the judgement to a minimum. I'm sharing this because I genuinely want to change for the better after living like this for 20 years.For a little background I grew up in a household where my mother and I weren't on the best terms and all she did as I grew up was work occasionally and sleep in bed all day long. Microwave dinners were a regular thing for me and my brothers I did pretty bad in school blah blah blah. The big thing was I was never taught good hygiene as a kid. It was never required or encouraged enforced. I grew up and went through high school without showering regularly doing assignments or even engaging with many people outside of school because my mom didn't allow me to get out of the house much. I'd spend my time playing games reading and a loooot of media. Don't get me wrong I wasn't a weird smelly kid in highschool surprisingly with the whole shower thing. I didn't sweat or anything and always used deodorant and perfume clean clothes etc. I had a lot of friends that I talked to daily up until senior year. My senior year was when Covid hit and everyone was in quarantine. When school started back up I never went because it was online. That same year I moved in with a new bf and his dad and uncle and since I was so accustomed to staying in a room all day without socializing or doing anything that's what I did there. I dropped out of highschool and lived with my new boyfriend at the time for two years and to this I realized that I still never leave the room I stay in. Even when my bf has a job that requires him to travel for work I stay in the hotel room still having horrible hygiene habits although again not smelling bad or anything and consuming lots of media from the bed. I'd have moments where come to the realization that l've spent days weeks then months doing the exact same thing and wasting the entire day away doing absolutely nothing. It's only dawned on me now that something could be wrong and I should hear other's opinions on it. Of course I'm using a throw away because sharing this is embarrassing enough. I've never considered myself depressed and honestly I never want to but every time Hook up what l'm dealing with sucide and help websites pop up...I don't know how to go about this and I genuinely want to do better so if anyone knows some steps I can take to doing better I'd really appreciate it.I've been like this my entire life because it's just how grew up but don't want to waste away any longer.,Depression
22121,I feel very depressed tonight I do not know what to do to lighten things. I feel suicidal too. I do not know what to do. I am feeling really low tonight.,Depression
20398,I have heard countless people saying that they are hungry all day and gain crazy weight. For me I feel less hungry during the day and crazy hungry at night. I am wondering if anyone on this sub has taken mirtazapine and been able to lose weight. Mirtazapine only makes me hungry at night.,Depression
19681,If there is a more beneficial sub please lmk so I can upload this there. I felt this is th best place to post for now. This may be a bit Sorry for errors in advance I am on mobile.I 23M currently am stuck with my thoughts as I cannot post this anywhere else. My girlfriend 22F who is currently 12 weeks pregnant. I am trying to be supportive despite our living situation where I live with my mom and she lives with her grandpa. Our living situation is a story on its own but we plan on moving in together before our child's birth. Currently I am working overnight retail and preparing myself for college. I also am the primary care taker of my mom due to her having eye surgery and she is just old I am general. I am living two lives and as you may think it is very exghausting. Recently I have been taking more control over my health. I am 225lbs and been trying to lose weight by eating right and going to the gym. With my girlfriend I have been setting more time for her than training and to counter I have been really focusing on my food intake. But lately maybe due to stress or my diet but I have been dealing with severe stomach pains that come in waves. It quite litterally requires me to be near a toilet at all times as God knows how much my body releases. The pain comes in waves and I end up taking longer hot showers over it. Lately my girlfriend has been wanting me to go to her appointments for the baby. As much as I love to go sometimes I feel like I physically. Recently I have been trying to focus on my job as I am trying to save money for this apartment. it is not much since I am already paying for most bills in my mom's place but eventually I will have enough to move. The problem is I am the only one doing anything. My girlfriend is currently unemployed and has been getting money from her grandfather. My girl has been going to there is recently and has been diagnosed with severe depression anxiety bipolarism and possibly manic. I understand she needs more attention but lately it is been becoming toxic. For starters she cannot take any prescription medication to treat these as she is pregnant. She tells me constantly she is depressed and I try to help but there is only so much I can do. I offered many times to come over and spend time but usually these end up with me cleaning her room or just popping in for 5 mins. I am not really complaining over that but concidering she lives half and hour away and with limited money for gas it becomes a deal with me especially since I am the only one who has any type of money. She tries door dashing but it is more of an excuse to hang with her friends as at the end of her days all the money she earns go back into gas. And top of that she drives constantly so she is always out of gas.She has tried working in the pass but she is the type to raise hell if she can get any small benefit from any employment. For example in retail. She was required to just stock baby food... She refused because she says the it is not her job to pull out pallets as she is pregnant. We have another girl in retail same build and is further along that does alot more then her. Again this is not bashing this is just to give you an example. Consistently fighting with managers because I am every department if there is something heavy she will not do it. Heavy as in 15lbs heavy. So with her not working and spending more time with her friends it is put me in a state where I know I am going to be doing all the work when we move in together. I honestly do not care because everything I am doing is for my my kids. But it is kind of hard to not only go to work take care of my mom and take care of my girl while also trying to take care of myself. it is come to the point I have stopped eating regularly as I am too tired. I chopped it up to work but really I am lying to myself. I have been depressed and I have no one to talk to about it. I stopped doing things I love and every day just crawl into bed hoping for the days off. It does not help I have 3 dogs I know I am unfit to take care of as every day I come home to find a new fresh pile on the floor mixed with urine since mom is not awake to take the dogs out my brother abandoned us and his dogs here till he can get his own place so for now I am their care taker too.Every day it just gets worse and worse and I feel even when I have the energy to do something it does not matter. Nothing stays clean other than my room. But still I do not like living in a bedroom. I stopped working out I stopped gaming and even smoking green. Nothing helps and I am even concidering dropping college to focus on my family when I move. Today has been the worse. I have been having stomach cramps and have been on and off the toilet at work all night. I told my manager and thank god she is understanding. Just told me to do what I can but if I want to go home I can. I stuck it out but in the morning I felt like death. I told my girlfriend about it and today was suppose to be her 12 week checkup. I told her I might not be able to come due to my currently predicament. I did not get a response but instead I got a message from her friends basically bastardizing me saying I better go because they do not want to put up her. Basically if her own way she told her friends that I am not being supportive and it really fucked with me. I responded back to her saying to pick me up when she is ready but honestly I think I should have told her off because at the time I was basically preying to any higher being to take this pain away even after spending an hour in the shower.By the time she got to me I had cold shivers in 90 degree weather and was basically asking to be epsteined to stop the pain. Well the whole time together was nothing but silence. I am there trying to hold it together when I feel my body basically trying to fuck with me any way possible. Nausea instinctive to puke cramps overall a grand old time. Nothing. Not a word. Not even a are you ok? I know I messed up for not saying anything and currently am waiting for the verbal chew out as I type this. Problem is mostly I understand I am in the wrong but really I do not know what to do. I feel like there is this sucking feeling in my chest. Where I feel like there is a hole in my chest that only makes me more depressed. It does not help lately I have been catching myself going on tinder and looking at all the single women out there. I do not know why maybe envy of my life before? Maybe there is someone better? I do not know and I do not want to know. I know in my heart I do not want to cheat. I love my girl and I love my kids and never want to break that but it is getting stronger every day and it scares me. I cannot post this on any social medias for mostly this reason alone. I cannot even talk to her about how I feel because honestly I do not feel worth the saving. I just want to raise my kids and love my girl but in the past my girl has been more or less unreasonable and controlling. Basically telling me that mother's gets all rights to kids by default and really fatherhood is more or less a privilege than a right. I have not seen anything that says that but she is adamant that that is reality.I do not know if that is true for the Ohio but really i do not care. To me I say I will let the kids decide if one or both parents deserve them. But as I type this I see how far I am falling and really I cannot seem to find a answer to explain to my girlfriend without telling her she needs to do this or I am done I cannot do that with how unstable she is. As my health is declining I am finding less of a reason to care. My emotions are numbed I do not have insurance to go to therapy I have no friends to talk to about this and in paranoid if she knew what I was saying she drag me again for not being there.So guys please any advice would help. Should I leave? Should I stay? What do I say? or is it wrong how am I feeling and I need serious help? Anything helps at this point. I do not want to lose my kid but really it is looking like I got no choice and I am the bad guy no matter what. I am about to be a dad and I have severely depressed,Depression
40004,i m extremely suicidal but i want to live could anyone give me reason to live i don t want to feel this way but i hard not to think about it please anyone,Depression
9569,No idea where my life is going. Feeling depressed everyday. Medication is not working and is causing me constipation and making me more irritable. Life seems to be upside down. Everything annoys me and irritates me. But yet at the worst point right now i feel relaxed. I think sometimes when we are given too much control of our lives when life is perfect we feel less happy waiting for the next best thing. that is for me at least. My life is objectively quite shit right now yet i feel as a result of a loss of control of my life safe. i feel i can make the best out of every day despite feeling like crap. Holding on,Depression
23337,I still do not want to completely give up. I am already doing all of the basic health stuff as best as I can. I just want to be able to study again. What things can I try to be able to do that? I got denied treatment for depression what now?,Depression
38557,have a brain tumor worst part is i have no one to help me or comfort me good news is i know that if i tell them i will make it worse if they can t handle the small stuff they can never handle this i m so alone it not even going life threatening,Depression

24371,I do not think I have depression but I have definitely gone through phases of self harm and numbness I try and stay as positive as possible to try and hide myself from my friends and family and I think it working. I think a friend saw my scars on my shoulder when I was getting ready and he may of told the rest of my friends. I feel like know cares about anything important and we are becoming emotionless robots trying to sustain life while still continuing out self destructive behaviour. Anyone else think this? Burnout,Depression
15504,I realize I am in a level of depression where I am fine until I start thinking. I have to be constantly distracted. Cohabitation with certain people and internet help but I am so deep in it I have to push away the thoughts that are real. Thoughts of grief thoughts of trauma fear of the futures in which I am not sure if I will be able to afford to live. I do not have the money to get help or get back on my medications. Legally I am homeless at the moment which is something that unfortunately is not a new thought. I cannot help but feel like things will not get better but worse. How can I succeed if I am depressed? How can I make money if I do not succeed? Why try to fight what time has shown me I cannot? Broke and depressed,Depression
23590,The feeling of loneliness and isolation always being the first one to start conversations and set up appointments with friends. Feeling more and more distant to family members parents grandparents sisters etc The need to consume alcohol etc to cope with constant negative thoughts and loneliness overall and the restlessness that comes with it. Some weeks or even months I can get few to zero missed calls or messages notifications on my phone. Constantly and progressively blaming myself for everything and having my selfesteem eaten up. Example overthinking everything I do feeling like people around me hate and dismiss me especially at work Having some kind of aggressive thoughts like a flight or fight instinct. Not feeling like the words I say and express gets taken seriously and some kind of deep anger grows within. Thank God for this subreddit where we can share and comment on our deepest struggles. Can anybody relate to this?,Depression
17317,So a bit about me I am a 21 year old guy. Grew up in a family that strongly believes in academics to be the most important thing in life. Consequently I had no lack of support from them for my studies rather saying I want to study was a common excuse for me to not do my chores. While I say excuse I loved to study. We did not have internet or television so most of what I read was textbooks provided by our school and sometimes novels I took out of the school library. My school grades were top notch. The school itself was highly competitive but when I graduated from high school I had the fifth highest score in the school. Pretty good everyone expects me to do well. I also did well in some entrance exams and got into a top university studying CompSci.But that is where the happiness stops. The university is terrible at teaching and that demotivated me from studying the subjects all by myself. The result? Terrible. My grades dropped. But still they were not that terrible in my first year. I had a fail grade in one subject which I cleared. But then that one fail grade completely demotivated me. I stopped paying attention to classes and eventually stopped going to them. My friends and some of the better professors would ask me what is wrong and I would do my best to avoid them. Eventually I was scared to even go out lest I will meet some of my classmates or teachers. And the result was obvious I failed all the classes that semester.Now I was too scared to tell this to my family. They were bad enough when I had one failed subject last time and warned me that I will be not allowed to continue studying and waste their money if I just wanted to fail. So I showed a fake grade sheet. And yes they want to see the grade sheet or they will not pay for the next semester. I thought I would maybe clear those subjects one by one and they would not know. But now the shame of missing most of the classes in the last semester caught up and I realised I could not concentrate in the classes at all. No one would talk to me voluntarily and they would just answer very short when I ask something and sometimes will not even do that. So eventually that semester got fucked too.And this happened the next time too. I failed most of the subjects and had to fake my grades. But the university had terminated me and I had to appeal for them to reinstate me. They did and I had to retake the previous years subjects. But I did not know anyone from the class and again could not concentrate. I had planned to kill myself in the end of summer semester 2020 but because of the pandemic we had to go back home. Back home I pretended to be attending lectures while doing something else on my laptop. The last year I attended exactly 0 classes.Of course my family thinks I am studying but I am not. Remember I said I loved to read? Now I cannot even fucking concentration on reading something. Every night when I sleep I promise myself that I will start studying tomorrow but that never happens. The moment I open my textbook or some website to study I lose all motivation. I cannot do it.Today was supposed to be the day I graduate and receive my degree. My family does not know. And they are one phone call away from knowing. we are not too rich we cannot afford a regular psychiatrist. And anyway I will be the one blamed because that is how it has always been here. If I score low in a paper it is because I did not study enough not because I had a fever. I had a fever because I am too lazy to study. What do you think I will get when I say I have been failing for three years I have just been faking my grades.? I do not even have enough skills to find a job and no one wants to hire a student who failed three years and could not get help for himself. And academics was the only thing I was ever good at.Frankly every night I pray that I will not wake up alive. I do not have the guts to slice my wrist or stab myself in the heart or hang myself or something else. I have came close to completing those things but I just cannot do it. I have ruined my life and I hate myself.,Depression
15366,I used to be very suicidal and have attempted to end my life before thankfully nonsuccessfully and in the recent months I found myself loving life for the first time. In the past few weeks or so this feeling has gone away. I now have spent all of my nights sitting and thinking with a feeling so hollow that I cannot even put it into words. I thought Id come out of my depressive state but now it feels more like I was only able to set it aside because of how busy I have been during recent events. Nowadays its gotten worse though. I am not going to pretend like I do not have any friends or something the truth is I have more than I can count. But I have never been able to share personal information with any of them even those I have known for most of my life. In addition to this I have a girlfriend of 3 and a half years who I have been feeling distant with recently. She is always upset with me and has become less understanding of me and the things I try to tell her. I think the reason for this is that were both growing but unfortunately were growing in different directions. It just pains me to know that despite all these people in my life they all see me as a crutch. I am someone to talk to when THEY have an issue. Once their issues are resolved they only keep me close enough so I can help when they need it again. I just really wish I had somebody in my life who could match who I am that I did not have to be a therapist for. A person who could level with me instead of trying to be under my wing. It might be my fault though because I tend to try seeking control or leadership so I give people the impression that I am the one to turn to yet people do not expect me to turn to them. I am not even sure what I am trying to gain from writing this I have just run out of options. If you read this thank you. If you have any insight or anything please let me know. I am afraid I am falling back into the depression I thought I got rid of,Depression
10563,I say I do not care but then why do I care if people worry? that is only reason why I have not harmed myself externally I just do not want to worry people.I have said this to many friends but if i where to die Id like to be alone so I could be dead knowing that no one knows I am gone and know one worrys. I only feel like I exist to want the companionship of a relationship.Why does it feel like everyone is watching me judging me being disappointed in me?Expressing my thoughts and feelings seem to hurt people and push them away.. so I should not express anything and keep hiding behind my fake smile? I guess I should because if not then id worry people. I do not understand myself,Depression
8525,Hi my name is Nick I just turned 18 on the 23rd of July I just started college and I do not know what to do with my life . I am crying as I am writing this I cannot believe I am this low in my life. I am know as the happy guy everywhere i go. I go to therapist sessions but I cannot get everything out. I just put a facade over everything I cannot take it I refuse to believe I am depressed because I do not want people to think I am faking it or them take is a joke. I have one friend that actually cares about me I do not even know for sure but I like to think so.I do not know what to do with my life I hate being here I hate everyone I just want to be dead but I want to be alive. I hate this because I know I do not have the balls to kill myself but I so badly want to do it. I want to watch all the shows that I want to watch I want to be with my friend. But I cannot take it I try talking to people but It does not work I do not know what to do. I am so desperate for something to happen I do not know what. How do I get over this please help I cannot take it,Depression

8127,I would prefer to keep my identity anonymous but I am at highschool and I was basically a pretty energetic individual until I got hit with the fact that my friends hate me because of a stupid asshole I ended up becoming the quiet nerd not really as I was not working enough at my school work even though I am confident I am an excellent student. 2 years later I ask them again now if we can go out or something and they told me they would see 3 out of 9 people supported me and were able to make that asshole agree to voting which ended up being that I am not a person they would ever invite and my friends did not stand up for me they just rules are rules so I just cut all contact they can have with me which I think does not really matter because they would not give a fuck I have been suffering from social anxiety for many years and now the only thing that I can think of is why am I hated and for how long and I cannot talk to anybody else and now I am just surrounded by no true person I am breaking down and might have suicidal thoughts any advice please? My friends hate me hanging out with them because of some stupid assholes who hang out with them and I cannot take it anymore,Depression
13520,The title says most of it. Fuuck. All the self improvement in the world id still be 310 at best. I am tired of it. Sucks being ugly. On top of it depression which kills me ugh I know I am fucked when I go to the amiugly sub and everyone is way more attractive than me there,Depression
19542,Since I was 16 I become the target for this girl and was bullied relentlessly because I had breast and she did not I am Only c 14 what is wrong with it this lead me to damage self esteem I become a shut off yet I weighed less than my bullys I do not think I am ugly but I have a hard time feeling beautiful since every time I am happy with myself she drags me down but soon as I stand up for myself I am the bad person pretty much everyone calls me beautiful cute adorable because they know I suffer from low self esteem I never tear anyone else down to make myself feel better unless your that girl who made fun of mine she talks shit about anyone over a b cup and anyone she views a prettier than her complains why boys like me and how they should like her while she has a boyfriend wtf she is 22 btw and still stuck in her high school phase its no wonder people do not want to spend time with her . I never had a problem with my breast is she jealous Struggling with self esteem,Depression
16803,She was the best person. We had a relationship. Not a lover type. But a brother and sister type. I seriously treated her as my own older sister. I felt loved. She understood me. But I fucked up. I did that. I destroyed it man. I should not have told her that I was depressed. She helped me so I thought I could depend on her. That was my mistake. I got too attached. It sucks so much. I had the only I ever wanted and I destroyed that.,Depression
27074,I have been dealing with depression from my teenage years and got prescribed medication when I was 12. I was living with my grandma at that point and she thought I was tricking the doctor and was proud of me for doing such a good job at appearing sad. I was not faking it. My family were never big on mental health and its only recently that I got to discuss it with my mom. I am in college now and have been going to therapy for the past 2 years. Therapy is fine. I mostly attended the sessions when I was not having an episode so basically I have not attended one in the past 6 months. I mentioned how I started being more open with my mother about how I was feeling she helped me pay for a trip to visit a friend. I was there for a month helped a lot. I was ok for the two weeks after I got home and now Its back to square 0. I feel ungrateful. I had a chaotic childhood growing up and it made sense how I was feeling then. It does not make sense how I am feeling now. I am surrounded by people I care for and doing the job I love studying the shit I could give my life for. But instead I waste my time either eating or sleeping because they are the only two things I have energy for. Getting off my bed to go play a f videogame is the highlight of my day. I have friends inviting me to go out but looking at myself in the mirror I do not think anyone should see me at this point. I cannot see myself so why do I expect others. This is not how people know me. I am a workaholic. I am an extrovert. The friendly person that cleans up helps and does shit to make my mom proud. Right now I am just an ungrateful disappointment of a child. This has been written after two hours of banging my head against any surface crying for someone to make it stop. I feel like a disappointment,Depression
38326,i feel so trapped and stuck i don t do anything all day long because i simply don t want to do anything period no goal or dream i don t want to be anything or have material thing like a house or car i just want to sleep i don t work or do anything productive everyday is the same and it just so boring being here and feeling like this i m not good enough for anything or anyone and everyone just ignores me anyways i have no friend never dated i hate how i look and it can t be changed i m lazy worthless hopeless i just can t take this anymore nothing work i think about suicide all the time i ve even looked up handgun but even then i need money and i m broke i just don t want to be here anymore knowing i m never going to be content and just a waste,Depression

15066,Maybe the Zoloft is wearing off or something I feel so empty. I do not have anything to be sad about so I am thinking its those fucking chemicals.I have been taking Zoloft since the 19th of October 2020 so maybe I have gotten used to it. My depression seems to be back again even though I take medication.,Depression
48250,Wasting away First time Poster so I apologize in advance for any formating issues. I just came to realize how numb I feel today. For some contest I 24F have been struggling mentally pretty much since childhood.I've had low selfconfidenceanxiety and have been pretty depressed for as long as I can remember. Life has always kinda sucked and any good times usually don't last more than a couple of days so I guess all the hurt and disappointment has been building up and now I'm almost completely numb aside from the random anxiety attacks at 3am.I've been aware of this for a while but the sheer extent of how tired I am and how I don't care about anything anymore hit me today when I found out that all the neglect towards my studies has caught up to me and will most likely result in me either barely passing uni or not even being able to graduate meaning I will have no degree and just wasted a bunch of time for nothing. The tought of that used to scare me but now I just don't care that much . I am so lost on how to improve but at the same time I don't have the desire to do anything about it. All I wanna do is sleep and not wake up I wish time would just stop. I don't know why I'm writing this for some advice maybe ?or just venting to strangers online is alot easier and cheaper than therapy.,Depression
38765,i have a constant fear of potential health problem and not being loved and ruining my relationship when i m with him i m constantly thinking of thing that can go wrong and way i could screw up and illness that we could suddenly have i am exhausted of living but he make me energetic about life i hope i don t screw thing up with him he s great and my happy place i m anxious and i overthink just about everything coming out his mouth even when it is kind trying to take it day by day just wanted to rant,Depression

39679,feeling really cynical about it my life is a fucking mess been two week i don t sleep getting crazier and crazier everyday but don t have any room for taking care of myself because of a 0h week study contest to come and even my weekend being splitted between people i need to see right now just thinking i ll kill myself after all these contest if i don t blow up before then taking rest is a no no i have diagnosed disability that my teacher don t care about dying seem like my only escape and comforting thought,Depression
11242,I have decided after my 19th birthday August Id like to die. I am waiting because I want one last celebration with my family before I go. I am dead set on my decision and there is no changing that. I have picked out where but now just unsure as to how. I am scared of doing it myself so I was wondering if its possible to pay someone to do the job for me? If not Ill find a way. I am so sick of this world and everyone in it. I just want to be at peace. Can I hire someone to kill me?,Depression
21887,For your partner to treat mean just because they are in a bad mood ? They take everything out on me. I find it funny when they say they cannot wait for me to get home they miss me and when I am home I am treated like crap. Like how can you say I am the sweetest person but yet treat me so poorly. Idk how much more I can take I find myself crying and I am a grown man. The way I am being treated I would not allow before idk why I am letting happen now. Is it right,Depression
20505,I have suffered from chronic depression caked with anxiety for my whole life. it is an inherited thing so no getting rid of it. Maybe I will not have kids but I try to look at my life as a gift with an obstacle. When people do not know you have depression it is like they feel the need to point out everything that is wrong with you and when you are happy you do not understand how important that is to you.it is so hard for me to find something that lifts me but I have realized that there are things that exist for each and every person that feel like a calm bubble of air after drowning for what feels like an eternity. it is hard for other people to understand why I get so happy over things like this even my friends who suffer with the same thing as me but I am so happy because for a short moment I get to experience joy and I want to savor it and feel the breeze of relaxation on my nerves. The thing that cheers me up the most is music. If life were perfect everyone would be kings and queens and everyone would be allowed to dance and have fun while listening to it all. I cannot speak for everyone but I can say that this gleam of light has made me feel so much better about life. Maybe some of you guys who suffer with depression can think about something that makes you guys happy and try to make the most of it from now on.For those of you who feel like me what things lift you up and make you happy? I appreciate everything that makes me happy,Depression
23390,I am not sure what I am looking for... maybe a way to not feel this way? My brother killed himself 24 days ago. We buried him 6 days ago. He was only 20 years old. My wedding is in 6 days. I do not feel any joy for my wedding. All I can think about is him not being there. I feel terrible for my fianc because I do not want him to think I am not happy to be marrying him. I love him. Hes trying his best and has been so supportive and understanding... I am just so devastated. that is all I have room for. This is supposed to be one of the happiest days and yet I know my family especially my mom is not going to be able to be mentally present. And I understand and its fine... but this past week trying to get everything done has been so tough because I do not have my mom to help me She can barely leave the house and all I want to do is lay in bed all day. My friends really have not been there for me and made this time more stressful so I do not want to talk to them let alone lean on them during this time. My aunts and best friends even pushed me to have a bachelorette so I threw myself one since my maid of honor dropped the ball. But then of course none of them can make it??I do not like going over to my parents because I feel like I have to support them when I am there. This is just not how I wanted my wedding to be. I am supposed to be joyous. And I am just not. I am already on antidepressants and I am supposed to start counseling after I get back from our honeymoon. tw My brother committed suicide,Depression
23311,God I love this boy so dearly and it physically pains me to see him suffer. Lately hes been spending a lot of days in bed and has not been motivated to do the things he enjoys. When I called him today he seemed so sad and did not have much energy. He told me he did not sleep well the past couple of nights. When he told me these things I almost immediately tied them to being possibly depressed and I have no idea what to do. I told him that I love him and understand how he might be feeling right now. I said that everything would be okay and that he can ALWAYS talk to me if he feels like hes alone and needs help. I gave him some tips that I learnt in my therapy for anxiety and ocd like trying to focus on doing some meditation and becoming more active. I invited him to do some yoga with me and meditation but he did not seem keen which is okay. I am just so scared to lose him to this horrible illness and I just want to help him but I do not know how to.. can someone please help ? How do I help my boyfriend ?,Depression
38546,i am afraid that they are gon na abandon me or hurt me when people talk around me sometimes i feel out of place and i start to daydream and isolate myself i am afraid to love someone i am afraid that they will realize that i am worthless and abandon me so i stay alone single and i have a hard time loving myself i don t take my place i don t like going out in group often i find that the group move on without realizing that someone is left behind it make me sad i ve had different friend and i ve evolved over time there have been more enjoyable group and i am doing therapy since year yet i don t fit in anywhere i feel traumatized plugged into a different wave it make me want to run away from everything i feel like i don t have what it take inside of me that i don t know how to find myself what can i do,Depression
20190,I guess looking back on it my parents are narcissistic and a big reason I am the way I am most of my life i spent struggling with how i feel and i guess that is not changed today i still do not know who i am I feel stupid asking questions and just being a normal person because when I was younger or hell even now. My parents will try and invalidate what I say. And if were together and I say something there is always something to say back or some remark. And I have just learned to live with it. And after 2 failed relationships. And. In and outside worh friends and just sitting by myself I just feel alone and feel I surround myself with people who do not get me or just hate me because the way I am I have adhd and I suffer from it heavily even with medication I just idk I feel alone and for the past 2 or so years I have just not felt the same I find it hard to be happy but cannot afford a therapist it is a on and on cycle that I just wish I could get out of. I want to be happy make other people happy but with current situations I find it difficult everyday to be happy Just feeling a little down,Depression
22973,I have been having a very low week. I was excited to get a coffee at a new shop. I struggle already with social anxiety and everything else so its very hard for me and I try everyday to come out of my she will. I arrived at the place and sat down while I placed my to go order on the mobile app. I got a coffee and a bagel. There was a place to leave a note for the baristas so I asked if they could include a plastic knife for the bagel. I just put with knife in my order that was it! As soon as I place it I overhear all 3 employees behind the counter laughing and making fun of the person who placed the mobile order. They start saying omg you guys this person just said WITH KniFe gehehehe they were laughing like it was the funniest thing they have ever heard. They start saying the customer is stupid and going on and on. They then say do not forget guys WITH knife customers are so stupid I get up and go directly to the counter and I say something like thank you guys so much for making my day. I heard every single word. Thank you for making fun of me. You must be so proud of yourself I stormed out. did not even get my drink or food. I am writing a complaint to the company. I know this may sound small to some but I am so sensitive and I went there because I thought it was safe. Now I feel like an absolute idiot because I asked for a to go knife with my order. I already struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts. Its not okay to just make fun of strangers whether you know they are there or not. You have no idea what others are struggling with I just needed to vent. I feel so stupid now Employees made fun of me,Depression
17437,Now I graduated but guess what? cannot find any job because I will join the military in 2 months it is obligatory where I live . Even shit jobs like customer service will not hire me .So here I am 25 never had relationship never had real job on medications. If only my parents were dead I will do it without hesitate. I tried to have a life but I was not given a chance,Depression
23561,I thought I would found a really good new friend someone I really liked. I had hoped we would be good close friends for a long time but things did not turn out that way. Yet another promising friendship ruined why does this always happen to me? I trusted them I opened up to them and they made me look like a damn fool. I am feeling deceived betrayed disappointed and really hurt.What did I ever do to deserve all this pain? False hope,Depression
23170,I do not feel like living anymore. All i do is hope for a better tomorrow but it never cimes. I loved one way street too many times. what is wrong with me?I like people i try to help my friends though tough times. But no one is here for me. I want to die so bad. My favourite fantasm is to drive at 200kmhand hit a wall. I m not strong enough to end myself. I would not mind if it looked like an accident I like music and driving fast and i want it to end me Die.. i want to end it all.. i m tired,Depression
16125,I do not even understand simple set of instructions. It is keeping me from performing well in society. I also have low confidence and low self esteem. At work my manager thinks that J am dumb. I was never like this before. Certain events in my life has caused depression. Years of depression has reduced My26 M memory cognitive abilities. What can I do to retain my learning ability?,Depression
24326,I am really tired i really just want to give up on life I mean I will die anyways right? in this world we live in people that are considered losers people that are not good enough people that try but fail anyways will end up being forgotten because no one likes the idea of people trying their hardest but failing anyways because its unfair but that is just how life works its unfair.My life has been pretty much just me trying to be better to get better to improve I have no talents at all I am bad at everything and many will say that may not be true that talent does not exist but i myself try to prove otherwise all my god damn miserable life. I tried sports i was the most garbage player all my teachers thought i was not trying hard enough even though i was feeling so frustrated over the fact of how much i practiced and how bad i was at it so ashamed of myself for not having the talent ofc my asthma lead up to just me struggling most of the time to keep up with lessons and practices. Music? my presentations were the worst and I am not being negative i wish i was because i know how bad my teacher felt for me every time tried to keep up with music. I tried getting better at academics that was the worst decision of my life trying to keep up with one of the most difficult my highschool in my country i failed no matter how hard i tried to show that i could at least get better at school and graduate from that prestigious highschool i failed like the idiot that i am. What about art? all my life i wanted to become an artist but in the few art classes that i had the only thing i could hear from others was quit doing art its not your thing like the ignorant i was i decided not to listen to them and that lead to just even more disappointments trying to prove myself to realize just how much time i spent on something i could not say i was good enough at least just realizing how everyone around me was right they were not being mean to me when they were telling me to quit its that they did not wanted me to feel disappointed of all my hard work still bad at art no matter how much i try I am a failure.rn i do not really plan to do anything what am i supposed to do? i tried i failed i did not give up but it was all the same why? were not things supposed to get better if you try hard enough? why my hard work does not pay off? i did everything i could to avoid feeling like a failure to just realize that that is what I really am I am tired because life is not mean for me. Damn even my English sucks i should really just give up on everything i know my family is not going to care for someone so useless like me to be gone i do not have friends so I am sure no one is going to care the world is better without failures. Not anybody is meant for life,Depression
9358,My kind generous selfless girlfriend is currently battling a severe case of depression and I am having difficulty navigating it and in the process I am making it worse on her. This woman has always been the mark of excellence to me. she is beautiful in all ways brilliant and vibrant. Her sense of humor is unmatched and remains the only person I have seen literally laugh through pain. Unfortunately she does not feel the same way and she is beating herself up internally. she is under a lot of pressure both in terms of interpersonal relationships and academic expectations in addition to all of the weight the world around us inherently puts on her. I am not sure how to help her and when I ask her she does not know either. I am definitely guilty of having what I have seen described as the typical male urge to fix things and yeah that is backfired. Ill ask her what can be done on my end but she does not know. Talking about it does not really help her. She ends up feeling stupid or as if she is an inconvenience. There are only so many distractions and they are only effective for so long. I deal with chronic anxiety and mildmoderate depression but what works for me has not worked for her. I cannot help but feel that I am worsening her depression and that scares the life out of me. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Advice needed for handling others depression.,Depression
40583,swoyer fighting depression isn t a easy a it may seem because you never truly know how that person feel and people have thought of suicide because they feel a if that s the only right thing that they can do and they think it s the much easier route to go along with life,Depression

11447,Seriously what is the fucking whole point of depression when we were once all happy kids. As kids all we want is to grow up and have jobs and freedom. I am 19 years old and I have realized the reality of life. I do not understand why we feel depression or anxiety if we were once happy. Why does the brain have to make us feel this way its honestly so sad and it makes no sense. No one ever chose to feel this way or when the fuck did we sign up for this. Why cannot we all just be happy and live life happily. What the hell is the whole point of depression,Depression
7644,Hi lately I have been feeling really depressed and I do not know the reason I have been crying for several days too. Some days are better fortunately but I feel stuck and worried about the impact of my mental health on my future. I cannot get therapy because my mom said I did not have problems when I opened up to her for the first time I am 17 btw I guess some parents are not open minded and understanding enough to understand mental illness. When I try to have fun I cannot enjoy it I always feel either sad or numb. I remember the times when I was not even feeling depressed like that. I hope it gets better one day but I feel guilty for doing nothing for it. I tried to read books about mental health but I do not have the motivation for it yet.

11225,I am tired of life. But i will not end my life. Why? I do not have a positive or uplifting reason. I do not want to burden people with the consequences of my passing. I would rather be able to erase my existence. To simply dissipate like a wisp of mist. No one remembers me so no one has to be sad I am gone or angry and why I am gone or judge me for how I go. I could simply go move on to whatever comes next with no consequences to those around me. I wish to be like mist.,Depression
20939,My every day is a living hell. I can never find the motivation to get out of bed for my own sake but I love my siblings so I have to force myself to get up smile and bear it just for them. All I do is game watch anime and browse reddit because it is all I have the mental strength to do. I have not had a true friend in years and my last 3 relationships ended badly leaving me with mental scars that make my hope for finding a new partner next to none.I am unlikable period. So many problems an ugly body and a fuckedup personality. there is no way anyone will ever truly love me and I am tired of being lied to. I am afraid to trust people because I have been hurt so many times by people I trusted and loved. But even so...I need someone. A boyfriend who would talk to me when I need support call me just so I could hear his voice when I feel lonely who would hold me when I cry and so on but those people only exist in fantasy. they are not real I have never met one and I do not think I ever will. The only time I ever get to coexist with that kind of person is when I am asleep dreaming. And even then when I wake up they are gone and I have to cling to the memory like water in my cupped hands until it is gone. I have found and lost love so many times because of these dreams that taunt me. I am starting to think it would be best if I just never woke up so I could continue dreaming forerver. I am tired of being tortured like this guys. Without a partner or friends I do not think it is worth it. Yet I am too afraid to kill myself I am a coward and I hate myself in every way possible. I doubt I will even get replies. I can only be happy in my dreams,Depression
38378,every single day i just wake up miserable and an insane urgency to immediately end myself everything is just empty now nothing really get me excited and i don t even have anyone to talk to cuz most of my friend are just not that close my family is much worse a nobody ever care about each other i have a father but i don t have any father figure cuz he wa and is never there for me ever i can t even share anything to anyone cuz everyone just tell me that it s normal for people my age to experience the thing i am going through i just absolutely hate my life and everything i literally have no will to live i even sometimes subtly and unintentionally put myself at dangerous situation to like somehow get myself killed even though everyone just say it s normal to experience these at my age i don t see anyone my age talk or even behave the way i do i also hate the fact that i am self aware of every way i am behaving but still can t seem to help myself fix those thing i really really really hope everyone is living better life than me,Depression
47269,Wasting away First time Poster so I apologize in advance for any formating issues. I just came to realize how numb I feel today. For some contest I 24F have been struggling mentally pretty much since childhood.I've had low selfconfidenceanxiety and have been pretty depressed for as long as I can remember. Life has always kinda sucked and any good times usually don't last more than a couple of days so I guess all the hurt and disappointment has been building up and now I'm almost completely numb aside from the random anxiety attacks at 3am.I've been aware of this for a while but the sheer extent of how tired I am and how I don't care about anything anymore hit me today when I found out that all the neglect towards my studies has caught up to me and will most likely result in me either barely passing uni or not even being able to graduate meaning I will have no degree and just wasted a bunch of time for nothing. The tought of that used to scare me but now I just don't care that much . I am so lost on how to improve but at the same time I don't have the desire to do anything about it. All I wanna do is sleep and not wake up I wish time would just stop. I don't know why I'm writing this for some advice maybe ?or just venting to strangers online is alot easier and cheaper than therapy.,Depression
47884,What's going on with me 22F.Last year had been so weird. I graduated. Fucked a relationship up. Didn't cheat but the ex couldn't take that I slept with someone else. He was broken so I spiraled guilty anxious lonely. Also I was preparing for a big test I cared a lot. I used to be worried cried all day. Then snap. I feel nothing. I'm sleeping all day when I go towards the books I'm like why. I'm so numb. Psychiatrist diagnosed me with atypical depression and gave me pills which I'm not allowed to take coz mom says there will be side effects. Today I was allowed to ride a bike. I hit a car and fell down. It was a minor accident but bro. I realized I felt nothing after that. Nothing at all. This couldn't have been me. I was a girl who was afraid to ride bikes I used to freak out so much now I just don't care. Not even the fact that I'm able to ride the bike. If it was the earlier me I'd feel goosebumps with a sense of achievement I'd feel fear anxious and scared about the accident. What's wrong with me I feel as though I'm an empty floating balloon.,Depression
26054,So I was in my family's basement chillin' and when I walk back upstairs to cook some food I see we are running low on food. So I ask my mom if we could get more groceries she says NO YOU HAVE TO START WORKING AROUND THE HOUSE BEFORE I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU! Even though I do all the chores she tells me to so I decide I would cook myself some pizza and told my mom that I would done all my chores. But when my mom heard that she started angrily walking toward the kitchen and at that point I knew I was done for. So when she got to me she punched me in the faced grabbed me by the hair threw me to the floor and grabbed the pizza including the pan and threw that on the floor and continued to yell at me. What should I do? I am to scared to stand up to her... pls help me,Depression
26708,Welp I am back amp dk that ill ever truly leave as depression is never a battle you really just win for good its just managing it better but i digress.So i came home for the 4th July wknd to visit fam from my new FT warehouse job. Well this has turned out to be lamest most boring 4ths that i can ever remember. We litrally did nothing amp my fam treated it like just another day on calender. Normally the subdivision my fam lives in in country has a bbqburgers andor fireworks get togethersocial. Well I have noticed over the last few years as the neighborhood has grown it has pulled back more and more from neighborhood events. I guess more and more people are having their own fam amp friends over rather than inviting a select group from neighborhood. But whatever it is its really sapped fun out of holidays. This has been worst its been bc lately at least there is been an impromptu gathering rather than something planned. But this holiday absolutely nothing. I have never been more bored in my life well i have but amp now i have another 40 hours in warehouse to look forward to. And not to sound like spoiled brat but there was not even any pie for my visit there was but read on. I am living on budget at my new job amp really cannot so much as splurge on pie i try to stick to protein amp health bc of physical nature amp long hrs of job amp as such was looking forward to pie at home. There actually was a full chocolate pie but upon going for it was told its over a month old amp needs to be tossed. Epic salt in wound right there. So needless to say I am a but salty amp depressed after waisting a weekend amp not getting the necessary mental health serotonin recharge. Family,Depression

16452,I am really at loss for what to do right now. About three months ago my dad was murdered. Just days before that my relationship of several years ended and two weeks after my grandmother who practically raised me passed away. Since the passing of my dad everyday has been agony. Not only because of how much I miss him but also because how much it pains me to see my mom this way. I have had mental health issues for many years but with all this happening everything else I have ever felt bad about seems like nothing. This is the first time I have absolutely no idea on how to move forward. At nights I get this crippling feeling of being lonely. I just want someone to talk to preferably about nothing and everything other than what is going on in my brain but at the same time I cannot bear myself to textcall any of my friends.Its gotten so bad that I made this account just to post this which as I am typing I realize I am not even sure why I am doing. I guess I just wanted to let some thoughts of my chest. Going through more than I can handle.,Depression
11567,Depression is just so damn brutal. Add on top being ugly virgin extreme social anxiety lower iq with learning disabilities. Many internal issues. All for what? Why the fk am I suffering when I could just be dead. Seriously there is nothing for me here. People who tell me tRy neW tHiNgs do not get me. The fatigue is beyond awful. I am so scared of death. I hate religion for making me scared of hell. I think very awful things of christians now. I hate this existence. I am so alone so dead inside and just gone. I am not even here Idk how much longer I can last,Depression
22032,Do you think that depression may because sleep disorders? such as somnambulism I am trying to know why is happening to me right know. I have been thinking that maybe sleepwalkingtalking is related to emotional stress or a side effect of depression or anxiety. Any of you have had the same problem? Parasomnia sleepwalking or talking,Depression
19835,I am writing this not knowing if I will ever actually send it I do not know why I get so anxious when I think of you or make an attempt to reach out. All my thoughts disappear and the only thing I experience is this weird warm sensation in my chest there is nothing but a feeling of faintness like my insides are slowly evaporating. Images flash of what I think your life is like today and I also see memories of other times we have been together. These latter are mostly from moments all our families have been together I mean the families you have joined with in marriage and our own blood relations. My reflections of the weddings that I know I was at in the flesh I experience in the same manner as I envision how your current life is like as if I am a passive observer as if I am dead or a ghost. I saw a picture of me at your wedding and I remember feeling so out of place in that world I recall it now as if I were never there disconnected and a complete stranger. Sometimes I ask myself if I will ever see you again I imagine our lives forever separated as if that were the answer but it does not really seem any different than its ever been even when I did appear at various holidays and family gatherings.My life today is just a meager attempt to scrape buy do the bare minimum just to keep living for what? I do not know. I work by myself and mostly just sit in my truck and read when I should be working. I do not really care. I can get away with it so I do it. I would not say I am depressed I can get by most of the time without ever having a sad thought most of my life these days is characterized by indifference. I think about trying to change my life in some way but mostly nothing comes of it I do not really care. I am just another life amoung millions of others doomed to die in obscurity. Sometimes I see myself as having potential to do great things but then I take revenge on this cruel world by becoming a martyr who will die with this potentiality in my grave. At times I wish I had been born thousands of years ago instead of today. This modern world is grotesque and foreign to me the paths in life we are limited to tread are dehumanizing. Sure many people make their own path but I lack the strength and imagination. I do still dream of the perfect life. For me it would be a life of endless travel. There are so many places in the world I would love to visit. But then again I know I am doomed to live my days out in this miserable country in this pathetic world of an era that cannot even give us the satisfaction of failing so we can create something better. No. I am afraid man is doomed to stagnate forever in the filth of democracy and freedom mere titles and images while the few toxic hands of corruption really ltigtliveltigt on the backs of the bodies that suffer in the transcendence of eternal hope.I am rambling but my point is this world is lost to me. I do not have any hope and without anything to believe in a man cannot be said to exist. I suppose this is why I experience your presence current and past as a ghost or as if I have never existed all along and this life is only a dream with my body a mere paroxysm of nerves whose only force is born in the desire to exist.Looking at these words I probably will not send this message. But this is the gulf I so desperately want to bridge but I know my breath is lost in that void so sending it is still the same as not. If I am practically dead already why not make it official? I can never send you these words how could I? My life is so diametrically opposed to yours. I am afraid I am doomed to live like this. I am deathly afraid. I have no place here. A message to the void,Depression

19796,I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for a few years now and it has made even the most basic daily activities and interactions feel like a chore. Since my life is going haywire now I have finally decided to seek professional help or ecounselling sessions if possible.Are there any free online counselling services available in India? Those that provide counsellings via calls emails or video chats. And if yes can anyone help me out with them?

12430,I am quite functional I go to work and take care of myself and the apartment. The thing that bothers me most is the amount of sleep I need to get through the day. I sleep like a baby at night anywhere from 810 hours but still I need a two hour nap after work. I cannot function if I do not have my daytime shuteye. Do any of you suffer from excessive sleeping? I got my blood work done and nothing was wrong. How much do you guys sleep?,Depression
7283,Okay I do not know where to start and it is going to be pretty unorganised. And I cannot completely express myself so most of it is going to end up in my mind again ig I not sure.I am introvert antisocial athiest logical etc and this personality was not expected by my parents and people around me. they always have been forcing me to change my personality. I want to explain them so hard and with that rage you know so that they feel it ig that let me be what I want and instead of scolding me everyday shouting and wasting your time just do not force me to change my personality. I can understand why they want to do that people here all neighbours judge a lot and they are going to make your life harder in a society if you are not what they wanted and I have to pretend which is not enough and always end up getting teased by those extroverts. I want to tell them idgaf about you I do not want to talk to you but I cannot.Most of the times especially at the night when I am about to sleep I start reviewing my day and explain to myself and correct what mistakes people around me made how stupidly wrong they were it is not like I am correct but I do not even have a chance of debate and those people are always wrong. Their comments are always homophobic sexist illogical and it is also about me sometimes which are generally misleading and wrong even of my parents they scold me for wrong reasons most of the time and the explanation I have which might have will change their mind ends up in my mind.it is not just about home even in school I am so shy I am not able to answer anything or justify myself and end up getting scolded for reasons I was not supposed to.Some people might say just speak what is on your mind how hard is it? Damn it is hard for me and I am not sure why everytime I take a long breath to talk I end up exhaling it and not talk anything. I seriously forget words it is like blood instead of rushing to my brain is rushing to my legs and arms and asking me for flight than fight. So most of the times I am like I cannot do anything now I do not care I will just move on but at night I realise how it is going to affect my life and I am like why did not I do that why did not I say that and get depressed everytime. I am sure that I am going to struggle my entire life and end up destroying opportunities and just imagine how my life would have been better. I am lonely never been in a relationship and have few online friends which is another source of depression and there are more things . Sorry if I have been just repeating topics also it was not as interesting and thank you if you read all of this . Idk why am I sharing this idc about upvotes It is just like when I am explaining about how wrong people were about the concepts to myself which does makes me somewhat happy ig but I end up in depression again bc that is not going to happen. It always ends up in my mind.,Depression
22261,I was in the nothing matters anymore mindset for quite a long time now I let go of controlling my life at all and the worst thing is that it affected what I cared about the most academics I still studied enough to pass most of courses especially that I would get really really anxious at exams. Now my gpa is ruined and I have a very small chance to reach my pre depressed goals which only makes me feel more hopeless and its easier to stay depressed because everything I lived for or everything I was expecting is gone now.Its like I am okay with being isolated and not having friends but I am not ok with not getting a good gpa? I am one year closer to graduation and I really need to transfer to a better uni Depression and gpa,Depression
18814,Its been getting a lot worse lately and I do not really know how to stop it . A few of my friends has commented on it describing it as annoying or unbearable so I am trying to look for solutions about this. Any way to get rid of negative thoughts ?,Depression
47899,I think I will never connect with someone in a real way. I'm going to be a loner for the rest of my life. I might talk to people here and there but I've realized I'll never truly connect with anyone. I could never talk to someone for an extended period of time and I could never care about someone in a deep way. Im just weird and I'm not like others I'm not meant to fit in this society. The only things that make me feel love in this world is music yeah honestly music where I can then daydream about a better place. I don't know I just feel tired of being alone and I don't think it'll ever change and its my fault no one elses. I wish that I could've lived a normal life just to be a regular person like everyone else. They all understand each other. But life for me has always been so strange like I just wasn't supposed to be here somehow I did end up here I don't know why I'm here.,Depression
23647,I do not know if this is because of depression but I just cannot get myself to do things until the last minute because there seems to be a force in me like a heavy rock or something weighing me down and making me freeze and preventing me from being productive. I still feel motivation but it is more hypothetical motivation than real motivation. it is not anxietyi'ts some sort of procrastination but not even so because instead of doing other activities I will stare at the wall or stare at my project but not really do it. I struggle to meet deadlines even though I have time. I feel like I have no energy to get something done but at the last minute a weird wave of energy can kick in as if I have no other option and sometimes it is fine other times there are negative consequences. it is a weird sort of procrastination but it is that I literally cannot get myself to do anything I should be doing. I keep putting things off. it is starting to really mess up my life and I do not konw what to do about it People tell me to jsut force myself to do what I need to do but I literally feel as if I cannot. This applies to almost every aspect of my life and I do not understand why. Inability to get things down and meet deadlines,Depression

15770,Been feeling completely unmotivated and struggling to do basic things... Idk why I am writing this here maybe just yelling into the void but lately I have not had any motivation to do anything and I know it is having an impact on my life ranging from basic everyday human needs to even the things that used to excite me I have no interest in to the point I barely want to get out of bed. If you read this I truly thank you and open to hearing any opinions on anything I can to do. Can barely get out of bed,Depression
21448,I grew up moving a lot and for that reason I do not have many long time friends. Childhood friends? None. I do not think I even know how to make friends anymore because every person I meet at work or college I think are just colleagues and do not even like me outside of that environment.Since my fiance proposed I have been facing the fact that our wedding is going to have a bunch of people he knows and like my family? One or two friends of mine? That thought makes me insanely sad and I do not want him to feel bad about having more friends than I do but I know I am lashing out on him.Everytime we go out with his friends he says I am rude to him and to other people. He says I either try to take all his attention to myself or I just stay there watching people and saying nothing which he thinks it is rude.That has happened a lot of times in the last three years and I have been thinking about how I do not have more than two real friends and maybe that is why I do not know how to communicate or behave. I do not know if I suffer from social phobia if it is just my depression and anxiety or if I am actually rude. I think I may be crazy. Like actually crazy.Its been so hard that everytime I need to leave the house to meet his family or friends I feel like throwing up I get so nervous I keep imagining how everything is going to go and how I should behave. Should I say hi and hug people? Should I just stay quiet? Maybe I should just stay on my phone or try to talk to people? If they ask me something how should I respond? Should I smile should I even continue the conversation or just answer the question?I do not know how I am going to live like this. I feel like I do not ever want to go out again. My fiance says I am rude and treat him and other people bad. I do not know if it is just my depression or something else,Depression

47682,I feel like a nuisance I feel as if I am nothing more than a general nuisance to people. I say this because I had a falling out with someone that I once considered to be my best friend while we were both away at college last fall. I've known this young lady since high school and I had a lot of trouble trying to make connections and new friends and thus she was the only person I really had up there because I was so lonely. She felt that I wasn't giving her any space and that I was too intrusive and as a result it feels like she wants nothing to do with me anymore. Sometimes I question if she really wanted me around. I remember during her birthday last year she had a bit of a celebration and I only found out because her then boyfriend posted it on Instagram. I felt left out. She said that she didn't want a large group and thus only invited people her parents didn't know and planned on celebrating separately with people they already knew. When we did just that she texted me two minutes before I was supposed to have her up that she was at a pizza party and would be running late. She did not show for another two hours. This past month I've tried to reach out to her in an attempt to make amends she barely responds to me. I asked if we could be able to talk in person over face time or over the phone but I get no response. Because she seldom responds I feel I have to start the conversation all over again. It's stressful and it hurts my feelings.Meanwhile before I went up to college I worked as a lunch monitor at one of my local elementary schools. This was immediately after I finished high school. While I loved working with the children I had some problems there. Some of the kids were defiant and very stubborn in their defiance. In the months before I went off to college I tried to start a bowling club but most of the kids would not even listen me and would just rough house and fool around. But the worst part was the treatment I was received from two separate staff members. During the 202021 school year when I started working at the school lunch was held in the classrooms and not the cafeteria. In the Kindergarten classroom I worked in there was a young boy who had trouble remaining seated and the teacher got angry with me. For two whole months she would scream at me calling me irresponsible complaining about how I can't be trusted and how I must be firm. When I decided to be firm which was what she wanted she had another adult in the room at times while I was there. If she felt I was doing something wrong why can't she treat me like a normal human being? Apparently she would go around and tell other people that she has to yell at me. I filed a complaint against her to human resources and apparently they felt she did nothing wrong.,Depression

24704,For the past two or three years I have been very alone I work a full time job I go home watch movies or play video games go to sleep and repeat. On fridays I usually get to see my friends but recently it seems like noone wants to hear from me or hangout with me. I have noone that I text all day like all my friends have I spend so much time alone I do not let anyone know how I am feeling or what is going on in my head because I do not want to bother them. I have not been able to cry for atleast two years I could always get to the point of where the tears are about to come and they just stop. Yesterday that changed I got home cried just sat there unmoving until it was time to sleep I got in bed and cried for 20 minutes until I fell asleep. At work today I keep crying of course hiding it. My body seems to be just upset with me or something. I am insanely tired all the time lonely I feel sick. I just wish someone wanted to talk to me.I am tired of feeling like this. I cried myself to sleep last night,Depression

If I start to lose weight instead of maintain I will have to eat more. But so far it is been maintaining.I wanted to share for those of us who are too depressed to cook shop get out of bed etc. I should note I was looking to maintain weight at 12 body fat male with optimal nutrition taking 30 minutes total or less per day for everything shopping from vehicle to house cooking washing drying eating drinking trash etc.. I read online that the average American spends 105.8 minutes per day on these tasks. I am at about 30 minutes a day.This has worked for me so far. Thought I would share. and yes I realize Aquafina water vs tap water could save a lot of money but I wanted to easily measure ounces of water and thankfully I can afford 16.31 per day for everything nutrition combined. Plus I am too depressed for anything for washingdrying dishes..I currently have no dishes to washdry everyday which is nice. Everything that is not Fridge can be thrown in my backpack. So it is very convenient for storage as well. I look forward to healthier blood panel results in 152 days time. Depression but did visit Registered Dietician,Depression
47109,I don't wanna try anymore I'm a 25 year old man who's never had a girlfriend or sex in his life and since yesterday I decided to give up trying. I have a very good life amazing family and friends that understand and support me no matter what I do I have a job that I enjoy and coworkers I get extremely well along with. I don't consider myself ugly I think I'm just mid. I nurture many passions am very extroverted and outgoing and I believe I'm quite smart but especially in these last 3 years I've been feeling extremely hollow and sad and the reason why is no matter what I do or how much I keep improving myself I seem to have no luck with girls. Yesterday I went out with this great girl I met in university 2 years ago which I've been texting on and off with. I thought she had interests in me since she was the one asking me out but as I later found out in the day she had been seeing this guy for about a month where she is studying. I promised myself to go into that date with no expectations but of course there was hope things would go well. However as per usual I had to go back home and cry myself to sleep for the 100th time and I'm just tired of this endless repeating cycle.People who've had at least one relationship in their life will never get the pain.,Depression
14945,I just feel like everyone I know is probably sick of me or annoyed with me and they just put up with me out of politeness. I used to talk about my depression but these past few months I sort of stopped talking to the people close to me about it because I am sure they are sick of hearing about it and I do not want to be a downer all the time. So I am just stuck here with all these feelings by myself and it honestly feels like I am drowning. I feel really alone and isolated,Depression
11974,I have been extremely suicidal from a young age. My depression is biological so I have had it since birth. I did not expect to live past 14 but I kept going. I did not expect to live past 16 then 18 then 21. I am almost 22 now and I feel the life being drained out of me.I never had a plan for my life. what is the point of preparing for everything when I was going to end it all anyways? You could say that I have friends and family to live for but my only friend abandoned me and my mother is controlling and has narcissistic tendencies and would willingly sacrifice me for her own comfort.I have no savings. I am in 2.5k credit card debt. I cannot escape my house and I do not have friends to room with. I feel like I am left with the option to end it all or sell an organ or two to make ends meet. I am so fucking miserable that even playing video games or just looking at fucking cat pictures makes me upset. Why am I goofing off when I could be working? What have I been doing with my life? Why have I spent so much time fighting?I am just so exhausted. I skipped meals for a whole day recently because I felt so guilty for wanting to spend money. I am tired and I want the pain to stop I have never had a future and will not have one now,Depression

I hate having to work every second of my life having to give love all day and do all the work of my childhood and beyond. Why was I cursed with this life. Its non stop work and its hell. I hate being here. Why do I have to spend the rest of my days doing the work my caregivers and parents should have But NO I have to waste my youth and adult years journaling every fucking day and exercising every day just to combat this.

13355,So my older brother is 26 and he shames me for not having a license and just now getting my first job at 19. I feel like he fails to realize that he had it easier at my age since our parents were still together when he was 19 so he had access to a car since he was 16. Our parents started splitting up when I was 16 and at the time I was doing high school and college at the same time since I was in dual enrollment so I already had my hands full with double the work and dealing with a toxic environment my brain just could not handle anything else. Then after I graduated I went away for school for a year and man was it hard during this pandemic. I recently got back about 2 months ago and turned 19 and decided I would take a gap year to find a job and transfer to a school closer because my goal is to get my license and commute to save . But how do I just ignore his words??? It hurts especially bc hes my sibling and it feels like everyone turned their back on me and I feel dumb for not knowing everything and for not having it all figured out at my age. Its really discouraging. Being shamed and looked down onto by family member,Depression
19180,Anyone who is christian and actually still believes in God this day and age please tell him to either A. Leave me the fuck aloneB. Transport me back where I simply belong like 40 years ago from now basically because I truly believe he made a mistake by placing me here in this day and age orC. Fucking just send me to hell already which is where my depressed ass probably rightfully belongs.Anyone still a Christian here? Not trying to insult anybody who is. If you are and you truly believe in God I am proud of you. I am glad he gave you a good life. Truly am. Unfortunately he does not do that for everybody. Some of his human creation he simply does not give a shit about. So 9lease ask him to either kill me outright or fucking help me . Or not. I do not really care amore at this point. Either way I will probably be killing myself soon anyways. As is God's will. A message for all whom God loves out there,Depression

47834,My 19 year old brother has depression. Background My brother is much younger to me and the youngest of four siblings. He has been dealing with depression and IBS since the age of 15. He is also suicidal when it gets worse. He is on psychiatric medications. We are a very dysfunctional family where my father turns everyone's life into hell to the extent possible. My mother has severe depression too. Current situation So after two years of treatment my brother isn't getting any better. There are periods when he does fine but then relapses into depression. His IBS also gets worse and it bothers him a lot. He is in general very introverted and doesn't let anyone know what he is feeling except for occassional aggressive outburst where he is extremely angry and out of control for usual problems like his IBS.My father is currently using financial abuse to torture my mother and brother who are financially dependent on him. But I am stepping up to help my brother financially and I tried counseling him and assuring him that I will take care of him no matter what. But his condition is not improving. He said he feels terrible that he is not able to be normal and do normal activities like going to college regularly or making friends etc. I told him that everyone's normal is different and he should work as per what feels good to him. That day he was fine for sometime but again withdrew to his room where he stays in complete darkness the entire time. It's been 56 days now. I have fixed a new psychiatrist's appointment for him and he agreed. But I want to know what else can I do in this situation. I want him to be fine and happy but nothing seems to work and he is 19 so we can't force him to do anything. Should I just let him take charge of his life and hope for him to get better? Or is there something more that I can do? No one else in our family is bothered or emotionally attached to him so it's just me. All advice would be helpful. Thanks!!,Depression

17102,Everyone pities me and looks down at me for my mental illnesses and I cannot stand it anymore. I am tired of being labeled weird or awkward. It is hurtful. It is disheartening. I got fired from my job and I know its because I was not outgoing enough. It took me weeks to manage up the courage to work it took everything just to go to work and I was so proud! And now I am so embarrassed. All those looks of pity when my coworkers grouped up and gossiped while I was left out. The blank stares people gave me when something I said came out wrong or the annoyed looks people gave me when I could not stop fidgeting. I thought it would be worth it because hey I have a job and I am going out my comfort zone right? Well now what? What the fuck did I gain but embarrassment and confirmation that I am not good enough and no one will ever understand or accept me. My Rant,Depression
10214,Hello there! I am 18 and do not know what is going on with me. Sometimes I have a really bad mood and sometimes I am fine. This consists of a week or so of feeling bad about myself hating me and basically everything I do. I do not find joy in almost anything and I feel empty and stuck in a dark void. I feel like something is missing. Sometimes I just want to be lonely and sometimes I want to have friends around me. Music is also a big thing because it sort of detaches me from everything. At this age I need to find a path in my life and seeing everyone around me already having dreams and going for a future career makes me feel useless. I do not know what to do with my life. Some days I feel infuriated about everything and everyone. Some days I do not. Some days I am just waiting for the night to come just so another day can start. have not felt suicidal or anything like that.Every single time when that feeling comes I become really careless about everything. do not fold my clothes anymorefor example. Everything is a mess to be exact. I do not have the energy to do and deal with anything.I feel lonely even tho I have friends then everything comes back to normal. I can feel good again and can feel an inner peace again. Everything settles down for a moment and comes back to normal. have not spoke to anyone about this except a friend of mine. I am not doing this for attention or anything I just want to know what is happening. Thank you so much. What is happening to me?,Depression

22456,The only reason I am taking them is because my family thinks they are the only thing that can help me now and I do not want to disobey them because I have already disappointed them enough in life. They have supported me more than most other parents I know and that is honestly the only thing preventing me from taking any other extreme measure but lately they have also been tired and given up all hope and all they do is taunt me now. The antidepressants I am taking are doing nothing except making me gain weight making me feel tired all day and worst of all they have turned me Into a freaking zombie. I feel like a psychopath and cannot empathize with anybody or anything anymore. The weight gain is making me further self conscious instead of helping me. The worst part is that I cannot even stop them cold turkey because my asshole Dr has prescribed paroxpaxil which has severe withdrawal even at low doses. Just wanted to get all this outta my system because honestly it was getting suffocating. Fuck antidepressants.,Depression
16247,Obviously loss of interestpleasure in onceenjoyable activities is a huge part of depression. In fact it is one of the hallmark signs that doctors look for when searching for a diagnosis. What I am asking about today is similar to that aspect of the major suckfest that is living with depression but a little bit different. What happens to me is that I suddenly feel like doing something that I usually enjoy is actually making me feel MORE depressed. Now when I say suddenly I do not mean in a relatively short period of time like over the course of a couple of days or even hours or minutes I mean SUDDENLY. Instantaneously. I will give an example scenario here because I am not sure how else to really give a clear explanation of this stupidity. Okay so I love interior design I have since I was a child. I love every aspect of it. I love creating floor plans and perspective drawings I love making presentation boards with every last detail represented I love watching interior design shows I love garnering inspiration and learning how to use new design methods and techniques and I LOVE going to home decor and furniture stores. Even if I am not buying or even looking for anything in particular I can spend literal hours just combing every aisle. it is my kid in a candy shop setting 100. So a couple of days ago I had some errands to run and I decided to stop by HomeGoods while I was out just to poke around. If I am not feeling well giving myself a field trip to a good home dcor spot will usually have me feeling like myself again in a jiffy. I got ready and left the house feeling relatively upbeat and excited for my upcoming treat. I ran around and got my errands done first to avoid feeling like I would had dessert without finishing my vegetables. Feeling like I earned whatever treat I give myself and knowing I do not have anything else I should be doing instead makes it 100x more enjoyable. I parked the car hopped out and pretty much frolicked through the front door like a big old goofball heading straight to the bathroom department in search of a new shower curtain because I actually do need one for my downstairs bathroom. As soon as I stopped in front of the display though I felt an extremely dramatic shift in my disposition. Just a few seconds ago I had been really happy in my zone. Suddenly though staring at all the pretty shower curtains felt like the last thing in the whole world I wanted to do. All I could think was This is stupid. Why am I even here? I turned a slow circle scanning the rest of the store to see if I could spot anything that might reignite my vigor of a few moments earlier. The more I saw though the more bleak and dismal everything seemed. It felt as though a black mist had descended surrounding me as well as filling me with a bitter defeated heavy sadness. I took a couple of deep stabilizing breaths but they did not help. My eyes began to sting and I knew I had to get out of there before I started inexplicably bawling in front of a store full of people. Feeling as though I had just lost something intangible but meaningful I slowly and dejectedly made my way out of the store with my eyes trained on the floor. This is typically how this phenomenon usually plays out for me though it sometimes happens in other ways as well. Sometimes I will feel great while I shower dress and do my hair and makeup but as soon as I am all ready to go I do not feel like doing whatever it was anymore. Like I said before it actually feels like the absolute last thing I want to do. Sometimes it happens right away as soon as I think of something I want to do. I will think I would really like to go take pictures in the woods and start to get excited by the idea but then in a fraction of a second that excitement is replaced by a crushing sadness in response to the same idea. So yeah the best way I can explain it is just that something I normally love to do gets flipped upside down in my mind and my beloved activity now feels like it is actually a part of the problem. It begins to feel like a source of depression and anxiety. To the extent that if someone asked me what is causing you to feel unhappy right now? I would reply the thought of doing something I absolutely love that is what is making me feel shitty right now. I do not understand why this happens to me but I am so sick of it. I am just so indescribably tired of the things I usually use to help myself feel better begin to only make me feel worse. it is so mean of my brain to do this to me and I cannot seem to find a way to make it stop. In fact it just happens more and more often as time goes by. Does anyone else experience this or anything like it? If so what have you done about it? Also does anyone have a medical or scientific explanation for why this happens? This Suddenly Sucks,Depression

47210,I'm so terribly afraid of death but I'm also afraid of living. I cried myself to sleep again last night. I was lucky to have loving parents which is why I would not kill myself until they pass. And I pictured myself apologising to the friends I have intentionally drifted from and hoping they will feel less pain now that we are essentially strangers. Then I started sobbing because my parents are getting older and they will really pass soon and I'm terrified of death. I'm scared that the darkness of death would be darker than any darkness I've been enveloped in and that I would truly cease to exist. That no one would remember I was once a person with noble and great aspirations to better the world and now I am merely ashes. But living is so painful and I've been seeking this release for over a decade.,Depression

47407,Nothing to live for. I have no where else to go. No one else to talk to. I have nothing. I wake up to work for my dad who abuses me daily and degrades me consistently but Im trapped. I cant leave I cant disappoint him. Day after day Im trying my hardest to just survive. Im not living anymore. Each day is another battle where the goal is to make it to the end. I dont live anymore. My girlfriend has been hiding shit from me and lying to me and Im such a coward and so lonely I cant leave her. I try my absolute hardest to take her out do nice things care for her and I get treated like shit in return. I dragged her from her lowest point of binge drinking and self harm into a confident hardworking girl who had goals. 2 and a half years of putting her before me for her to hangout with guys behind my back. I have no friends. My bestfriend I would talk to for years before anyone liked him or talked to him when everyone just hated him. Then finally he gets some other friends and he talks shit behind my back and tries to convince my girl to break up with me. Multiple times and she just lets it go on. My life isnt valuable to no one else so why should it be worth something to me. The only person keeping me in this world is my mother who is the only one to always care about me and protect me. shes my guardian angel always looking after me. And Ive tried to be the best kid I could for her. No drinking no smoking no drugs nothing like that to waste the hard work that she has put into me. If you have read this fair youve done more than 90 of people in my life so thank you. I hope you all are having a good day,Depression

23880,Is anyone else struggling with this? Some background I grew up and watched my entire family die off before I turned 30. I was there for most of it .. so much fear pain and suffering... it was just awful awful stuff and I would not wish those experiences on my worst enemies.I am not religious or spiritual... I suspect death is final. That being said I cannot wrap my head around the meaning of life. It is absurd. How can we possibly believe our small accomplishments are significant when there are billions of humans trillions of lifeforms and all of it is just a speck of dust in a larger solar system in an even bigger galaxy in a possibly infinite universe? The social constructs we create to box ourselves in and make sense of the senseless the narratives we tell ourselves over and over again the cognitive dissonance we experience when contemplating our own mortality ... all of these things are evolutionary defenses so we continue to feel good about ourselves procreate et cetera.The obvious answer is to stop analyzing it all and just enjoy the ride but as I am getting older I find myself obsessing about how I am utilizing the precious time I have left. Do I sacrifice the present to provide a comfortable future for myself? What if I die tomorrow? And after all these thoughts I cannot help but thinking what does it matter? My wife wants to have kids but the thought of creating more life that will inherently suffer and die makes me nauseous. Each year seems to pass faster than the next and before I know it if I am lucky I will blow through middle age and be facing down death sooner than I expect. If I were less afraid I would kill myself but something is better than nothing and the idea of nothing terrifies me.rant. Anyone battling similar depression and anxiety? How do you cope? Life is frightening and I do not know how so many people are so well adapted to the chaos. Crippling existential anxiety after losing all my family,Depression
17125,I am an upcoming college freshman. I took a trip with my friends family this summer we went to Disney.First five days were okay. Had some bumps but also had some hills really great times. I wish I could let myself go and enjoy this wonderful vacation with these wonderful people but alas the six day mark crashed into me like an atlas stone.I just left dinner to go cry in the hotel room alone. Rationally nothing sparked this. Maybe I just need to be alone I cherish isolation and have got little to none of it this entire trip. I do not like what this foreshadows for college. How am I going to survive? I cannot even enjoy a fucking summer vacation full of good vibes good people and good food. I feel so hopeless. So alone. Summer vacation takes a downhill slide,Depression
21238,I feel my humanity slipping away and find myself just hating everyone.

Feels like it is me against the world and I am tired of fighting,Depression
23489,Every day I find myself experiencing a sense of insufferable emotional anguish. Even though I give my best effort every day and am much farther in life than I used to be I am always wishing that there was something more that I could do to make my life seem worth living. Yet I never know what that something is. It is almost like I am trapped in every area of my life my body my emotions my family my relationships my finances etc. with no escape. I often dream of running far away with someone random that would change my life forever. I know this is incredibly unrealistic and from what I am learning it is beneficial to practice mindfulness and find enjoyment in the ordinary. I have tried creating a gratitude's list in addition to approaching everyday events at face value but it all feels like it is in vain. The only time I am comfortable with the mundane is when I am incredibly depressed and find solace in the thought of death. Does anyone else feel this way? Are there any strategies that you guys have found to help escape feeling trapped in your life? How do you deal with wanting more from life?,Depression
16472,What reasons do you have to live? I am trying to answer this question for myself and I am struggling. there is nothing I really want.Presently I am squandering my life and throwing it away I do not know what else I would do however.

I have no life goals or anything I do not know where people get the motivation to work towards things. Reasons to live?,Depression

16810,I have an efriend he is from another country he is really a nice person. We are really good friends. he is just an amazing human but his life is just so messed up. he is struggling w many mental health issues as depression anxiety ADHD at the same time. Also he is not even physically fit as he has many other health problems too. he is 20yo and lives w his parents but as much as ikhis parents are not really supportive towards him they do care about him but most of the time they blame him for everything. He does not have any rl friends either he is absolutely all alone and have literally noone w him . He had even tried to attempt suicide but fortunately he failed in doing so. I talk w him listen to his problems and try my best to help and comfort him in every way i can but at the it is only him who has to go thru that all. These days his family members are acting really carelessly towards him he told me that they have almost given up on him. Maybe they do care about him but the way they behave w him is absolutely wrong as all he needs is some people who are loving and compassionate towards him but his parents are not doing so. they are taking his condition for granted and now he too has almost given up i talked to him last night and he was almost hopeless from all the sides all he is thinking about how to end his life and i just FUCKING do not KNOW WHAT TO DO FOR HIM giving him advices and comforting him is not enough as at the end he just does not have anyone who has his back and he just cannot make it all alone i feel extremely bad for him but I am just helpless and idk what am i supposed to do now. I want to help him but idk what am i supposed to do,Depression
24098,Its painful waking up every morning acting like everythings alright. I just want to cry! I am sick of dealing with life ,Depression
23847,I have struggled with some anxiety for a few years now. I had symptoms of anxiety as a child that were not too obvious but now that I am older and reflect back I can see those symptoms should have been alarming. I had and still attachment issues. I would fear being left home alone when I was 9 parents could not afford babysitter and would often just spend that time crying. One of my elementary school teachers even told my parents I was not ok and should seek a therapist but they did not really listen. I had a hair pulling disorder I know what its called but cannot spell it and overall I was always an over thinker but at the time I did not know that was anxiety. I did get the hair pulling checked out when I was 1011 but that doctor was completely useless all they prescribed was a serum for my scalp to get the hair to grow back. Like thinking back I am not a doctor or healthcare professional but if a kid is pulling their hair during moments of stress I would think mmmhn maybe let us send this kid to a therapist so they can learn how to cope not just here is a serum good luck maybe if that doctor would have intervened right away my anxiety would have never gotten this bad. Years later when I was 1516 I would get dizzy spells. And it was concerning to my parents so they took me to the doctor. Same clinic but different doctor. All they said drink more water and I started doing that but my dizziness never went away. At that point I had given up on doctors. This clinic in my area is for the lower income on medical and is known to be very careless. My parents however are not English speakers so how would they know their mentality was well a doctor said she is fine so that is thatThen when I was 17 almost 18 I had my first panic attack. I do not remember much but I remember my mom being really scared cuz she did not know what was happening. And ever since then I have not been ok. I am 22 almost 23 now and its only getting worse. I have had bad insomnia this past month to where I flat out just quit my job because I was working early morning shifts. Retail job I am still in school so I can go a bit not working I have never had issues sleeping either so this is new. So now that I am very sleep deprived I feel super depressed. I feel like I cannot take it anymore and I am never going to get better. Recently I just met a friend a year ago that has been wonderful and my biggest support system. I do not know if I believe in signs but he came into my life at the right time because if it were not for him I do not know how much more of this I could handle. I know I have him to talk to but sometimes I feel like I am too much and I do not want to overwhelm him.Because of the no sleeping causing my mental health to worsen I do not know how much more I can handle. Its to a point where I have been considering ending it but I do not know. I need help I am hoping to see a therapist tomorrow at a walk in clinic but I know that is going to take a while to help me. And I want relief now. This was my way of ranting idk I need help tho. I do not know how much more I can handle,Depression

47664,Ever since I got off my meds... I started developing fears first I got really claustrophobic to the point where my dad exchanged an RV we bought because I couldn't sleep in the bunk beds due to panic attacks there were also other reasons for the exchange main ones being the need for more space and storage and now I've developed a fear of the dark.I got used to just leaving the light on in the hallway if I got too scared but today I went to bed without the light and looked out of my door I'm used to sleeping with it open and saw these stick figures and I'm telling you it scared the shit out of me I literally felt my heart drop thankfully it stoped after a few seconds of terror turning on my phones flashlight pretty much saved me. Now that I'm thinking about it it might be due to the fact that I haven't slept in 36 hours. But ultimately I feel like living is hard enough without me being constantly in fear of things that I know aren't real but my stupid brain still won't let go of.Also my doctors know I'm not taking my meds anymore it was my doctors plan to get me off them slowly I just kinda skipped the whole getting off your meds slowly part and went cold turkey.I guess I just needed to vent.,Depression
10709,No more long holidays already routine life you get to see friends less often and some people drift away.

9012,This year things seemed to be doing good finally got on t and mood started to stabilize to the point where I was not having meltdowns in broom closets at work dailyNow into the summer it comes backYear before this was in inpatient because I was hearing shit that was not there and decided to hospitalize myself because it was making me suicidal Year before that was out on leave for 4 months again around the same time of year late summerlate November that time because my doctor upped the dosage of a medication that fucked up my mood dissorder severelyYear before that was because I was suicidal was pre t hospital staff threatened to tackle me if I did not remove my chest flattening garment and kept me in a hallway full of strangers and misgendered me the entire time had a meltdown in front of said strangers who began to openly mocked me. I cannot afford to keep hospitalizing myself and if I try to just go back to my job I am going to end up killing myself there is nearly a 100 foot drop from the balcony to the floor in the building I am working in I have thought about it I have never gone too far but have had attempts through other means. it is going to be complaining and saying hey something is wrong and I need actual financial support and therapy from someone trained to handle trauma in a way that is not just telling me I have anxiety and that what is going on is normal I need help or I am going to die and no one will take me seriously until it actually happens. The only reason I am not dead now is because the thought of people going wow we had no idea this would happen makes me physically ill. cannot fucking do this shit anymore always back to square one,Depression
39321,i ve made phenomenal progress with my anxiety issue over the decade but one thing ha gotten worse and i m not sure what to call it if i start a train of thought and i suddenly remember something traumatic or embarrassing or unpleasant i start to feel bad and i start to say thing out loud when i say the thing it seems to release pressure so that it s easier for me to stop thinking about what upset me it s usually something like no or amen although it cycle and it s been worse thing like i hate myself or i want to die it s annoying enough when i do it by myself but i ve started doing it with my husband or child around and it worry me to know he s hearing me say these thing is this actually a kind of tic if not what is it doe anyone else do this,Depression
24118,I recently moved for college. I definitely had moments where I felt sad in high school and at home but its never been that bad. I feel really crushes by my expectations. There was this guy I talked to and I thought that we could really like each other. But I feel like I just liked the idea of him and I really do not know anything about him. I do not know why I cannot stop liking people. I want a relationship to feel good about myself and to not feel lonely and I know this could never lead to happiness. The only sense of excitement I feel is when someone likes me back or when I get compliments. I always posts pictures of myself on social media to feel good and so that other can think I am good looking. I do not like who I am now. I feel like I constantly rely on others people validation. I have talents and achievements but I feel like I do them all to have the ability to say I did them. Or I do things so that I can tell others about them and they can think that I am talented and good at things. I cannot even enjoy shows books or games without feeling like they are all pointless eventually. I do not really know what I like or what I am good at. I do not really know what it means to be happy and I have always felt this emptiness inside for a really long time. I think too much about school and I am obsessive about grades. Even when I score badly on a meaningless assignment I feel awful about myself and I believe that if I do not do well that means that others are better than me. I constantly compare myself to others too. I do not know how to have fun because all I do is worry. I am shy and introverted around people because I worry that they will judge me for what I say and I always pick my words so that they put me in the best light and so that they will like me. It makes it difficult for me to make friends and go out because I am terrified of what they will think of me. I do not know if I really enjoy anything. Everything in my life feels like a checklist. I do not think about dying a lot but I do imagine what its like to just be gone. I do not really think ill miss out on anything. I do not see how my life can get better if I do not truly enjoy anything. I know that a lot of the things I do are wrong but I do not know how to get better. I do not know how to feel good about myself and my achievements or anything I do. Even when I get validation for others I do not feel better. And it hurts even more when I am rejected or fail. I do not know how to get better,Depression
21194,I have had anxiety and depression since I was a kid. My mom left me with my grandmother months after I was born and moved away. My father left the picture before I was born. I always felt so alone and always felt like it was my fault. Like I was not loved or wanted and just there. I am an adult now married to the man I love more than anything but have always acted as if everything is ok. Always acting strong when deep down I feel so tired and weak and hide it as much as I can. I have broken down in front of my husband once but when I did I felt so vulnerable it made me feel so much worse about myself. Feeling like he deserves better than me and constantly over think why is he with me. They say you need to love yourself first before you can lover others but how can you do that when you get pushed down no matter how hard you try to get back up. I was bullied a lot as a kid taken advantage of and has made me feel even more and more worthless. I tried to end it all by taking pills once but it did not work and thought maybe it meant I had a second chance at life and things would get better. As I became a teenager I continued to be bullied. Had no friends struggling in school since I felt like I did not fit in and made feel stupid even from teachers. Got to high school and it just got worse. I moved away to a new school new faces and depression grew more. I made some so called friends that never wanted to hear about how I felt. They were all so positive yet I was the negative one since I just never felt like I fit in anywhere. As an adult I have no friends at all. Everyone i know is married with kids and always asked when I will have kids. I do not feel like having kids is an options. I am scared of the thought of bringing a child to a world and have them go through the same thing I did. My job gives me so much anxiety on a daily basis. I work with all men who look at me like I do not belong there. Constantly being put down talked down to like I do not know anything or good enough for the job. I put a fake smile act positive but on my breaks I break down and trying to put myself back together to do it over and over again. Day after day and its come to the point where I just feel so numb from life that I sometimes struggle with how to keep on going. Everyone sees me as a bubbly person but that is all I can show since if I show my true self no one wants hear it. Sorry for rambling on I just feel so lost and do not know how to deal with it keeping it all inside just hurts that is much more and feel like ending it all would just let people I love down and doing that hurts just as much especially getting guided that I am an adult and need to act like it. I hate this so much! I am tired of acting strong,Depression
8654,I am 21 and I have started feeling that I have not done anything in my life. I wanted to party with my friends do the late night road trips and stuff with them but my parents are too possessive about me and hardly allow me to socialize with my friends. And now I am 21 thinking that only 1 more year left to end my collegeuniversity days and then I will be doing some 95 job somewhere.. Everyone else will be busy in their life.. And when I am free to take my own decisions I will be burdened with responsibilities already.. What should I do?,Depression
11548,So idk if this is the right place to post this but I need some form of motivation. I have an assignment to submit in about an hour and I am only halfway through. Plus an IA tomorrow that I genuinely have not even prepared for. I missed a few other assignments for a different course and do not feel like going to class as of late. Finals in a week. I just sit around thinking and... nothing. Basically doing nothingAm I going down a bad spiral? I am normally a quite optimistic guy that just let us everything work out by itself. What should I do? Advice needed,Depression
11297,over the past year I have lost every single one of my friends. most were friends that were insignificant and i was not impacted by my loss. but 2 of the people i cared about most one recently completely ghosted me and left my life so fast its like they were not even there in the first place. i do not know what it is about me that repels people. so many of my old friends who completely betrayed me and fucked up my life and my self image are out with their own friends living their lives and having fun. and I am at home sleeping in every day so i do not have to face my own loneliness. my best friend moved a state away a few years ago and were growing more distant every day. my boyfriend and i are on and off and i have no one to rely on at all. i never thought i would face true loneliness but i am and its worse than anything i could have ever imagined. i do not see a point in living this way when no one cares about me. some people say oh i have no friends I am so alone when they really are not and they do not really know what true loneliness is like. seeing people i care about and getting out of the house helps my depression become more manageable but all summer I have been alone and at one of the worst points in my life and i genuinely do not know what to do. I have rotated through everyone around me that id even slightly get along with and i feel like there is nothing else for me to do. no one really cares until you are dead. I am so alone,Depression
12476,Hi everyone. First time poster. I just need to get this off my chest to people who might understand. To preface I have MDD OCD and GAD as well as PTSD.I 23F have been in a 2.5 year relationship with my boyfriend 24M and we have been through a ton together. He is my best friend. He is somebody who needs his alone time to recharge which I happily give him. Recently I have been extra depressed and just changed my medication from 450 mg wellbutrin and 20 mg prozac to 300 mg wellbutrin and 25 mg pristiq. It is a big adjustment period for me.I have been jobless since 2020. I worked as a nanny before and ended up quitting due to a personal life altering event. He stood with me through that.Recently he has been distant and I have not seen him in 2 weeks. I have been asking him if there is something wrong etc. Yesterday I finally said that this is not ok with me and I need quality time to feel valued in our relationship. He then told me that yes something is wrong and yes some of it has to do with us but he will talk to me tomorrow night. I did not want to wait 36 hours for him to break up with me if that is what was happening and finally got a call a few hours later.He said that he never knows what to say when his parents ask about me since I do not have a job and do not go to school and live at home. He spent a couple weeks alone and realized that our relationship is not in sync anymore. He wants me to succeed and do better for myself and I need to prove to him that I can do that for our relationship to work. Which I get completely. But taking a break with no contact for months is essentially a breakup in my opinion and he keeps insisting that he does NOT want to do break up.I feel like he has broken every promise he has ever made me by abandoning me in a time I need support the most. I have supported him through so much and I feel betrayed. He does not know what taking a break entails because we have never done it before and we are each others first loves and first serious LTR. I do not think he knows what he wants. I love him so much it hurts and I know he feels the same but this is basically a breakup and he cannot see that. I am trying as hard as I can to be realistic and logical but I feel like I cannot go on without him by my side. He is everything to me. But for this to be the solution for a problem he has never brought up feels devastating and unacceptable to me. If he needs time apart okay that is fine I get that but to give me an ultimatum out of the blue makes me feel like I have ultimately succumbed to my mental illness. I have been seeking new treatment and was finally starting to feel better but now I feel like I cannot move forward and do the necessary work because I have been abandoned by the love of my life. I am spiraling and do not know what to do with myself.I want him to be the one I call when something good happens. I want him to be the one to share my accomplishments and celebrate with. I feel so betrayed and gutted. I cannot do this without him. I want to give up.Were meeting later tonight to talk in person. I do not know if I should just break it off entirely to save us both the pain of a future breakup and get the pain over with now. Right now i do not believe in myself and without his support I do not know how I can achieve anything for a long time until I heal. Who knows how long that will take? I feel Like a chunk of my soul has died along with any hope for a healthy future.I am sorry this is so long and if you read this thank you from the bottom of my heart. Feeling like I cannot go on,Depression

Things like you need to eat a cheeseburger well if youd eat youd gain weight your skinny as a pretzel skin and bones skeleton etc etc. I could go on for days with the amount of things people have said about me being skinny. Im over it. I have a super fast metabolism and I literally eat 35 meals plus snacks a day. Im just so tired of being skinny and being shamed for it. I feel like a lump of bones with skin. At least people have convinced me thats all I am,Depression
22434,day 3 on here and things got worse. Honestly I do not know why I am here anymore. I feel like a punching bag for everyone to just insult me more and more. I always try to rush to the aid of people but it feels like everyone just watches when I am hurting. My family my friends do not even care at this point and I am past the point myself of caring. I feel nothing at this point and everytime I get up I take more and more time to get out of bed because honestly what is the point if I hear the same shit everyday from my family? Idk even know why I am writing this anymore. Idk.,Depression

19837,I have to do it. I have to take that jump. I am just scared of fucking that up too. But I should not overthink. I just do not understand why suicidal people are considered selfish cowards. In my opinion they are incredibly brave. Brave for taking that step into the unknown and pulling the plug. Brave for taking matters into their own hands. We never had a saying in being born so why should not we have a saying in the way it ends. I just hope I will display the same bravery when my time is there. I really hope I will. Being brave,Depression
26440,Thought I was starting to get better because I did not cry yesterday lol but jokes on me bc i ended up bawling my eyes out today because i remember my mom who passed away last year. I remember her last words to me was be good to your dad because she knows how much I hated dad for cheating on her multiple times yet she still forgave him. To be honest I have not done anything productive for the past weeks and I have three weeks backlog of my summer class because I cannot bring myself to study. I am on the verge of giving up on my course but I cannot because the last thing that my mom remember is that I am taking engineering and she is expecting me to be an engineer someday. I do not want to disappoint her. Executive dysfunction,Depression
26881,I just realised I wrote more than I meant sorry for that.. but thank you for being here anywaysWhere do I begin.. I am technically currently a university student but I may not be for much longer I have been at my university for 3 years took a foundation year and I have just failed year 1 again. it is been awful my 1st year went fine ish but in my 2nd year I was depressed still am and it really messed up my studying and my social life. I got a 2nd chance to retake the year and the university made me take counselling with their councillor and I was on antidepressants but I failed again. Which leaves me where I am now. I currently do not know if I have been kicked out yet or if the university will give me a 3rd chance. In the last year I think I probably have gotten addicted to alcohol and a couple months ago a stopped taking my antidepressants without my doctor knowing. Now I have no idea what is going on or what I am doing my parent has no idea about any of this. They think I will graduate next year. I know their views on mental health and its not worth trying to talk to them about it. I have lost my passion for anything I used to love and I have felt my emotions start to numb.I have not spoken to my doctor in a while because it always feels like I am being overdramatic about what I am saying. A year ago I applied for a test to see if I was on the Autistic spectrum and it seems as if I am even though I still have not heard anything. But so often I have trouble sitting still and there a parts of my day or even whole days that pass me by and it seems as if I do not remember it or as if i was not thinking as those times past me by so I want to talk to my doctor about these things like ask if I have Anxiety or if I have ADHD but I do not want to be that person that just thinks every little thing is a disability.I have just realised I have written much more than I meant I am so sorry for that. I will just leave it there. Its all gone bad,Depression
48243,How long does it take to know if an antidepressant is going to work or I need to try a different one? Ive tried 4 now where they made it worsethe side effects where unbearable but now Ive been on sertraline and the side effects are tolerable but hasnt helped with my anxiety or depression. Its been 4 weeks and today the nurse practitioner gave me the choice to try something else or increase the dose. I asked her what I should do but she said it was up to me. I didnt know what I should do so I just said increase the dose because the pills are cheap and I have to pay full price for everything until I hit my deductible. I dont know if a month is too short to know or if should be seeing a little improvement by now. Im starting to think I should have chose a different medicine but I dont know maybe I am jumping the gun here and I should just stick it out. This medicine makes me really tired,Depression
47687,Dont wanna be alive anymore Im just tired of being alive Im dealing with so much shit at a young age I dont know how I can live like this it all started when me and my ex broke up .I figured out I had chlamydia which turned into reactive arthritis because it was left untreated for so long before that though I was diagnosed with gerd which messes with me sometimes and then not too long after the breakup I hit a dab and got nerve damage in both my feet and hands.at one point I couldnt feel my legs or hands for a week and I still dont know what I have.I have mouth ulcers that wont go awayIm too depressed to even shower or just take care of myself hygiene wiseI believe the chlamydia was left untreated so long it caused permanent fertility issues so idk if Ill be able to have kids in the future or if I even want any because I cant trust another female and time and time again my doctors kept telling me I didnt have autoimmune issues yet I get nerve damage from hitting a dab like wtfI had dreads but they started to thin and fall out so now my self esteem is at rock bottom especially after my ex left and I still think about her till this day and dont think Ill ever get over her and all the long term illnessesdiseases Im dealing with I dont think Ill ever get over those and Im only 18.does anybody have any possible advice they can give me because Im seriously just thinking about unaliving myself like no one understands the constant turmoil I go through on a daily basis I need some help,Depression

11257,I really do not know where to begin. I am 38 years old and on my second marriage this will be explained in detail This marriage also includes a 6 year child that is not mine by blood but I still claim as my own. I am feeling really down right now and there has not been anything that can lift me up as I keep finding shit that brings me down. I am really trying to find to positive side of things but it just has not been possible. Now here is a long story of why I just cannot seem to get a break...My first marriage was medicare at first. I honestly did not want to be with her but she won me over and I married her.. We had many years of happiness and life events buying house cars etc. I ended up losing my job and joining the army to make ends meet and try to progress our status in life. I was gone from home for at least a year for training then another 6 months for orders due to premobilization of my unit. Shortly after I was off to iraq for 16 months. Needless to say I was away from my wife and home for quite a long while but I was paying the bills and trying to give her a life she enjoyed.During my mid tour leave I decided to give her a chance to come clean with any doings that I would have a major problem about mainly cheating. She said she started smoking weed but that was all... I do not mind weed but I did not want her hobby to interfere with my security clearance so I asked her to stop by the time I got home. Fast forward a while and I found out through her computer that she was sexting another guy a cop this will play a part later in the story and they were sending pictures and videos back and forth along with skyping all dating back to the time I was in Iraq. The first time I found out abou it I told her I wanted a divorce and left our house to live with my friend. She made a Deal with me that she would go through an uncontested divorce if I moved back in and went to marriage counseling. If that did not work out then she would grant me my divorce. Win win for me I thought....One of the conditions of the consousling was I was able to check her phone whenever I wanted to assure myself that no communication was happening with the cop. I did not find any for months. But I decided to put her to a test and see deleted the dude from her Facebook. All while making sure that I could see her text messages even if she deleted them. It was not but hours before I found the first text between them. They were not suppose to be communicating at all and she was trying to hide her tracks by deleting her messages. Then I laid another trap I left for military stuff for a month or so and decided to ask her for nude pictures. My goal was to see if she sent the pictures to the cop. I got the pictures I asked for and so did the cop... I immediately started the procedure to divorce this woman... Now on the the part that hurts the most. I found a woman that made me so happy and I found her during the finalization of my divorce. This woman was everything straight from the start. I told her ever single detail of my life and everything between. I even left the military for this woman I wanted a family and the military is not conducive to that. She already had a baby but that was fine with me. I fell so in love with this woman I asked her to marry me. We got got married then tragedy again.Our young relationship did have quite a strain. We bought new build houses twice within 2 years and then our house was hit with a tornado. We lost a friendship with someone that took us in to live with them we lived in a hotel for a few months then covid hit and everything locked down. We managed to move into an apartment during this time but it was still difficult. I managed to get tboned in my truck in which I broke 3 ribs punctured a lung and was knocked un conscious. So we had that to deal with. Eventually my new family found its way back into out newest tornado house. After we worked so hard to get it repaired.Mere months later I found out my wife was sexting with a cop. Keep in mind this is wife 2 now doing the same thing as wife 1. We are in marriage counseling now but it does not feel like it is helping. As of late I have been asking her if she is still thinking about this guy and she is flat out lieing about it.Tonight I found it she was upset over the fact that this shitbag found another girlfriend and that she thinks about him everyday and that she 100 knew there was a connection between them.Also fuck sexlife on Netflix because she feels that while the physical portion of that show did not happen the mental part did with the cop I found that out tonight as well so yay me... Life for the last 15 years has been such garbage I wished I died in Iraq. Noone else to talk to...,Depression

12796,I am alone I have no friends and my aunt just passed away today. I have no one I can vent to or just be extremely vulnerable with. Its been awhile that I have the feeling that today is the day. I do not want to be alive anymore. I do not enjoy it at all Ill never have anything real. Its always my fault I am either too depressed or to scared to enjoy life. I am going to die alone anyways so why not now. She enjoyed life so much it should have been me that died I do not deserve to live. I am starting to hate myself again,Depression

38797,i recently got caught at my school with a very small amount of weed my dad ha a number of reason to be worried about this he work in an environment where addict are he ha went to rehab for alcohol in last year ha had sister die of overdose etc he ha not gone to work for day in a row now and he tell me it s because of anxiety whenever i ask him what s on his mind he just say idk and that i can t do anything to help him now mind you i haven t spoken a single word to him about the incident stated at the start even though he is well informed of it every morning around the same time i hear him vomiting i don t have much experience with alcohol so i can t judge too quickly here and i understand i m probably not leaving enough info for anyone else to fully decide too whether this could be anxiety or something else just what should i do in a situation like this ha anyone had any experience with vomiting around the same time due to anxiety,Depression
10852,I am so tired. I am a veterinarian and everyday is just draining. I honestly just want someone to kill me in such a way my loved ones get something. What insurance is helpful? I just have the usual house and car insurance with state farm. Need help,Depression
47581,Want to die but just cant seem to do it I have 0 intention of living. Ive never been able to view life the way others view it and therefore never really enjoyed much in life to begin with. After cracking my brain for countless of nights i still cant come up with whats stopping me for doing it. This may come off as me being ungratefulselfish for my familyfriends but i cant live this life any longer just for them. It has already gotten to a point where theyre starting to blame themselves for how ive turned out and its just not fair to them. Yet despite knowing all of this and wanting to die with all my heart i still dont have what it take to do it. I cant even wrap my head around how pathetically weak my mind isCant i just do something right for once,Depression
16117,I notice that many people who do not struggle with depression do not fully understand what it is and it is certainly a problem. I cannot emphasize how many times I have heard people around me laughing and joking about them having depression or even assuming it is no more than a deep sadness. I am sure plenty of you have been able to see that too.From my own experience it is not a pit of despair rather than a mental prison. it is an open space locked off from the outside world. You still have contact with loved ones but it is strangely limited and inconsistent due to your own mind games you are playing on yourself. it is a feeling of constant or nearconstant isolation from all humanity when you could be surrounded by any number of people. it is empty. Lonely. Hard to make and maintain bonds. Motivation is hard to find until it is completely impossible to reach altogether. I am struggling to escape.it is funny because a prison break would likely be easier than this when I think about it. A prisoner can escape physically while it is an entire mental battle to simply get through the day without concerning anyone while you are struggling.To quickly clarify what my intentions are I am not here to rolemodel or tell people that they are not alone in their struggles. They already know that and from my experience that knowledge is not impactful in the slightest.I find that we are strong. Those of us who are still struggling are here today because we have still got a little bit of fight left in us. It certainly does not feel like it but for every second we are still here it is winning yet another battle against our stupid brains. The world needs to know that people who are struggling with their mental health are not all sad distant and mopey. we are fighting hard 247 and do not even know if we are winning. A Realization.,Depression
15938,I want so bad for something to go right. A happy life with friends and people who love me. Sometimes things are so unbelievably terrible that I start to wonder if religion is real and I died and went to hell. I think it would be something like being alone. I have not even seen a familiar face in over a month. Loneliness is killing me and nobody wants someone broken anymore. Things have so bad throughout my life that I am starting to wonder if I was a terrible person in my past life and this one is punishment. I do not even believe in past lives.,Depression
37995,i don t know how to explain it i had bad childhood and tbh i never felt love in my whole life if i care for someone and they see this they hurt me i m not only talking relationship but with overall people around me and i have depression i feel tired all the time and sometimes i can t even leave my bed also i m very paranoid i feel like everyone want to betray me u me and i have lost all the trust because of it don t even feel like human,Depression
20546,no one pays attention to my creations. not online. not in real life. people do not have time for me. people do not recognize me for my art writing and the things I work so hard to make but I know I will not make it into any museum like the artists who lived their whole life alienated and died to be famous. I feel like nothing I do has any real value. I have fun making art sometimes but no one wants to see it. no one wants me. I feel like I am delusional to feel like I have talent and skill in these things I have practiced my whole life when no one else sees it. people do not want my art or writing but it also seems like they do not want me as a person. how do I live with the feeling of loneliness and how do I deal with the idea that no one will care when my hard work turns to ashes when I finally die? living my life unaknowledged only to be forgotten when I die,Depression
25172,My adopted parents and I have not gotten along in awhile due to my depression. They constantly act like I can get up each morning take care of myself find a job etc. I cannot I have told them time and time again I cannot.. they even lied to my therapist about it. They want to move out in less than a year now to retire and Ill have no where to go. Ill lose my health insurance so all the medicine I need to take each day will be gone. I told myself so many times the moment I am homeless is when Ill find a way to die. They care about their happiness more than they care about me.. I am tired of them lying to me telling me they care then turn right around and do something that proves they do not. My only chance of living is trying to apply for disability but they are so against it I just know they have sabotaged it some how so I am probably going to get denied over and over. I have told them my plans and they brush it off and think I am not serious. you can threaten us with that all you want. Etc its not a threat its a fact I am telling you what is going to happen to me because I know how I am I never asked to live and suffer like this. I do not want to be homeless and I do not want to die.. I have no other options.. Not much time left.,Depression
13910,Hi thereI am 29 and have some new found depression that has come up for me as a result of the pandemic and lock downs and I know I am not dealing with it in the most skillful way. The one thing I am really struggling with is communicating with my friends. It is the hardest thing in the world for me to tell my friends that I am struggling today and I do not feel like doing anything including texting you back. Typing this out it seems easy just tell them but I know when I am feeling like garbage it always feels like the hardest thing in the world to text people back and communicate. I was wondering if you guys had any tips for me. Help Communicating,Depression
18062,I am just tired. Tired of this life filled with disappointment and sadness. I am tired of the depression and anxiety filled days overfilled by the nightmares each night. I hate myself and I hate my life. I have tried faking my way in the hope of that thought process sticking but its been unfruitful. At this point the only thing keeping me going is knowing if I give up it would kill my mother and I cannot do that to her.I have tried therapy and I have tried medication but nothing helps. Even when I have been happy with my partner a good portion of those days are filled with self hate and thoughts of suicide. As of late my partner has put me on a long break which is to end soon. This break has compounded all my anxietydepression to the point I breakdown at work gym really anywhere. I know that I have attachment issues stemming from friends that would leave me as a young boy to when my father killed himself on my birthday. I am ok with death but when someone leaves my life I crumble. Its as if a piece is taken away and I never grow it back. Losing my partner and or this break that will undoubtedly end in termination of the relationship is feeling like the last piece I have.I have tried to better myself and find me these last 4 months but its a facade. I carry this weight to the gym to better my body making each rep feel pointless. When I run I am only running from my demons. I have lost 60lb and I still hate what I see in the mirror. I cannot feel free. I try to pursue my education to no avail. I feel every test is just another step towards nothing but an empty future. When I am at therapy all that is going through my head is that its a waist as I know all the tools I can use to ease or erase the pain but I cannot and or they do not work. All I am doing is creating more of a facade so that my mother does not have to worry about me. I keep trying to do things for me but I hate it. I hate who I am. 25m idk I needed a place to vent and or looking for advice on how to let go of pain and self hate,Depression

18982,Today I am done. I really am done. I will be honest I am a teenager I probably have it easier than a lot of you here. Maybe I will not be forever alone. But I need to rant I need to get it out or it really is going to kill me. I am 16 right now yeah pretty young I guess. Back when I was 14 I dated this one girl puppy dog love but it was fun while it lasted. Then I hooked up with another when I was 15 that is the extent of my experience.I have friends they are a good bunch to be honest but I feel alienated from them. All of them have had a 'glow up'?. What I am trying to say is that all of them have got something good going in life. Some are hooking up some are dating you get the idea. But I am static I do not feel anything has changed for me. I am still the same height arguably the same face and I feel like a fucking loser. I am average at academics a little bit athletic I train karate and boxing.Well today I met my friends. All of them our friend group involves my exgirlfriend if you can call her that. Well they all sort of broke of into groups taking pictures videos and whatnot. I was the only one left out. Me and my friend had planned to drop off my exgirlfriend back to her house. What I am going to say next sounds fucking hilarious but I thought maybe there is a chance for something there. Well that went away as soon as she told some of my other friends that she is not really comfortable with me coming along. I have some self respect of course did not push after that.I feel like this is the final straw. I have done everything I workout I am in pretty good shape and my body reflects that. I speak confidently enough I wear good quality perfume. I have a good dressing sense. that is what people have told me at least. But it is not enough I have not gotten anything after my two earlier experiences. I had quit smoking a year ago. I started again I have had a runin with drugs and alcohol. have not let it mess up my life. Completely quit drugs and I drink once a month.Well I smoked again today I am thinking of drinking again. Might dabble with some safer drugs. I cannot do this shit anymore. Oh I suppose I am a porn addict as well. I have tried to quit a bunch of times. But I always relapse harder. A lot of this may be my own fault maybe I did something wrong. But it just feels as I have been assigned a certain role in life. A role of rough highs and lows except there are no highs. My friends cannot really help me they would not understand. These are supposed to be my fun years but they are not I just want to die peacefully at times. I guess whatever I may do I cannot beat genetics. Maybe my face puts people off my lips are slightly larger than normal I guess. Probably my insecurity speaking.However whatever I do and I think I have done everything I cannot seem to climb the wall. I cannot seem to beat the system. I always feared being nothing in life but now that I come to think of it. That may be my destiny. I think I will just slowly start destroying myself I might get cancer or something but I will have some amount of fun while doing it. But that is about it I want today to mark the day I give up. They say hard times make strong people I am not one of them and so I suppose it is natural that I will be cut out of the gene pool. I just wanted to share this with you guys I am still young but this feels like the end. I will end with something I have learnt from experience you can always fall further and the pain numbs you at a certain point.I hope some of you make it out I know I will not. Also probably should add depression sort of runs in my family so take whatever I say with a grain of salt. I do not know what to do anymore,Depression
19763,Even though I know I have issues...a ton...yesterday my husband's car was unexpectedly repossessed from our driveway. I CANNOT believe he dodged the problem and hid it from me for so long. I make hella good money. I have a doctorate. Why is my husband such a piece of trash? I just needed to vent. So I am a depressed overachieving perfectionist ADHD alcoholic and I am about to lose my shit...,Depression
18679,Mostly things seem to be circumstantial but it weighs much heavier when you have a constant sadness looming over you the stones life throws ar you get much larger. Being numb feels alright I guess its better than pain sometimes.Grief hurts loss hurts bad choices hurt. Being a lump of coal hurts. Depression causes me to deal with things so poorly. My head is swirling and I feel so low.I want to be excited for things I am doing but I feel like I am leaving things behind and I feel like I have lost a large chunk of myself one I am still desperately holding onto because I do not want it to be gone but I do not have a choice.Life feels cruel I blame myself for a lot of pain I feel. I do. But I also just wish I could let go of it but I know it is a pain that will not ever get easier just less prominent maybe. I am just really not doing that great,Depression

48220,29M. Moved out for the first time in August to work at a ski resort for a year. I feel so lonely and have no real friends here. not saying people here are fake but Ive become more of a hermit. Want to move back home and pursue schoolingcertification medical billing and coding. Feeling insanely depressed here.So I made the move out here last year 2 months before turning 29. At first I enjoyed it. Im able to buy weed whenever I want I get a better pay than I did back home and I dont feel like a child living at home. And the weather was pretty nice.But over time it started wearing on me. I miss my nieces and every time weve factimed they look so much older. I feel sad that Im not there. I miss my family and our family dog. Also I ran out of my ADHDanxietydepression medications and havent tried finding a new psychiatristtherapist because I dont want to deal with the hassle of searching around. I feel like I havent really connected to anyone here. I thought going out and snowboarding here at the resort almost everyday that someone would recognize me and Id make friends which is what happened back home but it hasnt happened. I have no dating life at all. I get 3 or 4 days off a week and spend them alone. Sometimes Ill game with my high school friends online which is the only thing I really look forward to but this fucks my sleep schedule even more.I work overnights and barely get any social interaction anymore. I try sleeping during the day but its difficult because my neighbors like to play their music super fucking loud. Why dont they just wear headphones?My sleep schedule is shit. I hate going to run errands because I have to walk 15 minutes to my car. I snowboard for like 2 hours and then feel like going home because I get overwhelmed by the lengthy lines.Once the season ends theyll switch me back to evenings as opposed to overnights but then Ill have to get a roommate. Having a roommate in these tiny ass dorms is horrible and I dont like it. No privacy at all.When I go back home I want to start regularly going to therapy again but am thinking how can I do that if I dont have a job. How do I ensure I have a job when I get back home? I dont live there right now so how the hell do I get interviews????,Depression
23733,She has made my life a nightmare and I am not sure what to do. I love him and I am not breaking up with him but she has gone completely crazy. She keeps yelling at me said I was trash and mentality destroying her son. It has gotten so bad to the point of her yell at me calling me fat. Her calling me fat has made me stop eating almost all together. She blames me for her 18 year old son not wanting anything to do with her. I have started struggling to get out of bed. I sleep when I do not work and cry every single day. This maybe nasty but I have a hard time keeping up with hygiene sometimes. I have even stopped taking my meds because I have no energy to do it. My boyfriend's mother is crazy,Depression

22638,I just remembered to put a trigger warning here. It might be... triggering I guess. But what do you expect here rigjht? I do not know.Well... I am in my room. Drunk. Again. it is not like it is often but it is not rare either. We had a nice family evening there with craft beer and our little music game. It was fine until... both of my parents got caught up in their own thoughts. Nothing wrong about that it is just... it was alwayds like this right? Even when I was much younger. I was always the last one standing. Anf I had to go to my room alone. Others were drunk af but I was just halfway there. And I could not open another bottle to sleep well bacause someone wpould notice the next day. So I always stay late listening to music. half sober. Alone. Again! And... I cannot stand it. I am drunk enough to be paranoid and see things but not enough to fall asleep quickley and so I just end up... Lonely. Again. And I am not sure I am ok with this for the rest of my life. I want someone to fall asleep by my side again. I cannot take it no more. I am so fcking lonely. And I cannot take my mind off the pills. I do not know anymore... I would do terrible things for just one cigasrette. Am I a terrible person?I wish someone just looked at me the way I look at my imaginary friend. Oh there. I said it. Seeing my mother's eyes... so drunk and so unhappy. It opened an old wound. BAck then. When I was 12 As lonely as I am now expect you left me therr with them. And the touched and touched and fucking touched. Adn I wish I was stronger. I wish I would have forgettn already but it is still there somewhere. And I recall the Smirnoff I recall the taste of yellow camel cigarette. I remember the stiff fingers. And I wish I wa s stronger... And deep inside I wish I had someone right now who would make me forget the unwanted touch the fake smiles the cigarettes I crave and the blades in my drawer that I want to stroke my skin instead of them back then.Will I ever get strong enough to forget? Will I be strong enough to be alone instead of lonely?I do not know anymore. I am not sure whether I am ok with this,Depression
20335,where the more you go deep more you feel hallucinations and doubt about reality. I have not yet diagnosed with neuro divergence but i sure feels this is what depression looks like. How does it feel you deal with forgetting things with everything like the past or basic usual life informations and finding yourself a hollow space?,Depression
39823,i m currently on 0mgs daily but i just couldn t do it anymore it s all just so hard i ve only just taken them so don t have any symptom yet i ve only taken the fluoxetine and nothing else is this enough to kill me i m slightly underweight do i need to go to a hospital or just tell someone i don t know what to do i live with my parent and i feel really bad but i still don t want to live anymore,Depression
18981,I do not know about you all but I feel like absolute fucking garbage. Opening my eyelids today was like fighting a tidal wave with one arm tied behind my back getting up off the couch was like climbing mount everest with one lung. I truly just want to lay down in the dirt and let time bury me slowly and peacefully like a rock being buried by erosion over 100 lifetimes.What I do know is that when I feel this way when I feel the universe weighing down on me and dragging its weight behind my feet in the shackles of my own soul is that there is only one way to get the love back we must give it away.People like us have such a hard time seeing the cup half full being grateful for what is present instead of grieving what is not. We have such an innately hard time absorbing love from the world around us and that in turn causes us to be handicapped in redistributing that love with the world.That does not mean we are truly weak tho. In anything that means WE ARE STRONG. YOU WOKE UP TODAY. you are READING THIS. YOU ARE FIGHTING THIS PROBLEM TODAY BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE EVER COULD YOU ARE THE MOST YOU THAT YOU CAN BE AND THAT IS A BLESSING. It means we are DESTINED. To be beacons of light emerging from our darkness and our hardships. We are meant to show others that no matter what no matter how hard you feel no matter how much blood you have bleed or tears you have cried you can still get up and live and love this life that we have been given. Each breath is truly a gift as much as it is a burden even when our clouds are dark GIVE THANKS that we have the time to hunt for a place where the sky is blue. You woke up today and I thank fucking God that you did. I love you.The only way to feel the love on days like this where I just want to fucking die is to give the love away. I have learned a few weird things in this ridiculous experience I have had on this fucked up rock hurtling through the cosmos but the most true of them is that for all the things that are good that bring joy and happiness that cure ailments and carry fortune of the the soul IN ORDER TO KEEP THESE THINGS THAT SAVE US FROM THE WORST OF THE WORLD AND FROM OURSELVES WE MUST GIVE THEM AWAY.This means even in times of hardship when our mental bank account is in the negative the only way to keep the money flowing is to spare some change. I know this sounds ridiculous and crazy and pointless because it is a cold cold world. Trust me more than most people I know. But trust me when I say that love the only cure to this ailment of ours is the only currency that pays you back as you spend it. We are not bottomless pits we are bottomless pots of gold that are waiting to be spent.And for that reasonOn this day todayWhere I feel like fuckin garbagioI want to say to each and every one of youI LOVE YOUIM SO GLAD YOU ARE HEREALLAH MUBARAK LAHGOD BLESS YOU ALLIT IS A GOOD DAY TO BE HERE WITH YOUpass it on my dudes. Only way to get better Bless,Depression

23446,I have a plan on how I am going to do it I am just scared. I am so sad and I want it all to end but I am scared it might hurt. Scared to end it,Depression
12644,I am a teenagerhighschooler and Basically a loner with so little friends I am struggling with emotions but not mentally ill I have Misophonia at the age of 14 and was born with mood swings I could not control my own anger and sadness aswell. Back then I have been already emotionally unstable and I seriously cannot fight my thoughts and feelings about a lot of things. I thought about hating myself all the time Even the girls and guys at our school think that I am a jerk A weirdo A stranger and many more I used to have friends but they never returned to me and I drifted away from themI got lonely I have no one to talk to but I am not so shy and I do love to talk but I am also not so desperate at chatting with anyone I think it is just better to leave them by.. I hate to say but inb4 I had many friends like a lot of friends but thinks gets worse as I become so confident egotistical and narcissistic. They started to hating me Every groupings I have been the sore eyes from them I have gotten very lonely by that and never got any friends left... I am probably a loser a creep uninteresting and Stupid. I never stop thinking about those days that people laugh at my mistakes I hope I was born a monster that I could fight back But since I know it is wrong I just could not do it I also think that I am a coward and weak and such... There more stuff That I wanted to say but let me end this for just a couple more because I do not want to make this too long. I was a very kind and loyal person I love to give people what they want and it joys me everytime I hear say thanks but no one in my acquaintances seems to know me well I have passion about art and 3D sculpture but seems to fade away because of lack of motivation...I wish I could much as in this subreddit... I freakn love this sub I hope I could cure my depression and I am so thankful to be here sharing some advices I know these things that I shared are not the ones that is as worse as the other ones but I believe that there is many more like me that needs help and after reading this would help us reach others hands and start a new friendship. I cannot Escape my thoughts,Depression
23146,Lately I have noticed I have very little emotional reaction to anything. This has been a sort of on and off thing for as long as I can remember but it has been lasting for a while this time. I do not really know how to describe it it is not like I am sad or like I never feel happy sometimes I do but most of the time I do not really feel anything. I spend a lot of my days watching YouTube or grinding out my summer class. At night I wach anime or movies this is mostly when I have the most feelings if I am watching something good at creating them in me. This is kind of rambling but I have been like this before and then I have periods where I do not feel like this at all and a mostly normal. I honestly do not really think this is depression But it seems similar to what other people have written about depression so I figured I might as well ask. I will occasionly have very vivid thoughts about killing myself I have no desire to ever do that but more and more I think about it constantly. I also will have the num feeling interrupted by random directionless anger sometimes. I do not know what triggers this. Anyway dose this seem like depression to anyone here and if so what can I do about it? I tend to perfure the periods in my life where I have more feelings. Do I Have Depression,Depression
25321,I would not wish this on anyone. I went from making a great salary last year to not being able to sleep this year when my company was bought which led to a whole host of sleeping medications....trazadone ativan ambien xyprexa coupled with propanerol to reduce heart rate. Then I had the worst 30 day headache of my life. I started SSRIsSNRIs...celexa had a horrible reaction to this and had to stop. My genetic test revealed I metabolize medications well but I am predisposed to side effects. I went on to cymbalta and now I am on lexapro. My initial trigger was 23 hours of sleep over a 15 day period and then I had the awesome experience of 45 days straight locked in fight or flight mode. In some ways I am surprised I have survived this. Prior to this episode I took like one Advil every 10 years....the desperation was and still is real. I am dizzy and weak I have lost a great deal of my memory which was photographic and my mental acuity and sharpness is slow as fuck compared to who I used to be. I was witty and humorous and showed a great deal of support for other people and now I only care about how shitty I feel and how no one can relate you guys probably can. I barely talk to anyone including my wife because I literally do not know what to say. I have been in intensive outpatient therapy regular talk therapy and all these meds that are not working and make me feel like shit. I have an awesome friend group and wife I was successful and own a home I was talented and driven. I barely know what day it is and there is certainly no way I can work right now. I would love to get back to work and life but I am not in control of this right now. The pain from this is much much more than just being sad. it is the loss of self your mental and physical abilities and the anxiety that comes from when will this end? and will I ever be who I used to be? that makes this truly terrifying. To top it all off there is no reliefit is not like you can pop a cough drop for a sore throat that buys you 15 mins of some relief depression is every excruciating second of the day. You walk around with an imaginary 200lb ball and chain on your leg that only you can feel. You are not interested in anything you can barely have sex if at all and you do not even know who you are or what you have become. I feel like since March I am only a heart and lung machine with nothing going on up above. If only depression was just being sad. It took me 40 mins to write these incoherent paragraphs that look wildly different than how I used to write. The reminders are literally everywhere in everything you do that you are not you. Good luck to everyone here that feels this...none of you deserve this and I understand what you are going through. I understand depression now.,Depression
27246,Have you ever had a dream that was felt so real and everything seemed better. Maybe life was better and some issues or relationships were resolved.Then you wake up and realise none of it was real and just think to yourself that was just cruel.Or is it just me? The best dreams are the worst nightmares.,Depression
8333,Hello thank you for reading this first of all.I wonder if anyone here is feeling or has felt the way I do and has found a way to resolve it.Anyway long story short I was always an underdog in primary school high school everywhere I went I was the punching bag I also had bad grades. I was terribly depressed and suicidal all childhoold which is not the issue here but I feel like it is related to this post. I am an elementary school teacher now I am also just graduating from university I think I am not doing so badly. However since my GF left me I feel like I am going downhill again. I am obsessed with improving myself studying just overall bettering myself at anything. I feel like I am just not good enough for anyone. Ever since she left me it is getting worse. it is like there is this voice in my head that says I am stupid and useless and there is no way to turn it off. It has been getting worse lately. I just do not know what to do. My mind has this idea that during the last year I was procrastinating too much and was not studying enough and is making me feel really terrible. Honestly I do not know. My mind is blurred. I feel like I am going insane. ampx200BI have never been to a psychologist nor will I ever go. I just want the voice to stop. Any tips? Lol. I feel insane just posting this. How to forgive myself for feeling not good enough?,Depression
26889,i just graduated from undergrad with two degrees that are not known for making bank. i feel like I have been pushing through all these years to graduate and having that path has been the only thing keeping me going. now that the future is uncertain i feel completely lost. i have no direction or ambition because of my chronic depression and now that there is not structured path of school i feel completely uprooted and lost. i can feel my familys frustration with my lack of initiative or drive but they do not understand that i feel powerless in the face of a future i do not even really want. graduation and the future,Depression

10285,Started smoking a lot of weed but even that is kind of losing its charm now. I guess you do something for long enough it becomes normal. And my normal is just this. Idk I am really tired of people telling me this is cuz of the pandemic. Cuz I know I was this lonely even when I was surrounded by people. My therapist was right. I do not want to help myself. I do not want to be happy. So why am I here. Well shit,Depression
38837,i had struggled with this decision for month and finally i did it today i think i had been thinking a lot about how to say it and what my bos would say and i didn t even think about how i would feel after doing it maybe bc deep down i kinda knew i wa postponing it for a long time kinda surprised myself today when i did it the thing is i m just really weirded out bc i know it s the best for me and my bos even said so that there s in fact no room for growth there but i think my discomfort come from a deep attachment to this routine i ve had for almost year even if it wasn t the best and not knowing what s gon na happen with my job life from now on bc i don t have a new one yet amp x 00b anyway don t wan na let my anxiety win and revolve around this weird feeling bc i think i should be proud of myself for taking the matter into my own hand for once and for all amp x 00b if you read this hi and ty,Depression
19689,I know the title for this post is strange but this is truly how I feel and have been feeling for a while now. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety. I also have OCD and autism so it makes my life a little bit harder than normal. Through all of the struggles and dark times I have I cannot stop thinking about how much I want someone anyone to just hold me in their arms and give me a long hug. It probably would not help in the long term but it would just be a temporary relief for me with the way I am feeling. For someone to just hug me for a minute would make so much of a difference you would not believe but unfortunately I do not have anyone around me right now who could do that. Like I said I would not just be permanently healed from this but it would be a temporary fix at least. Sorry for this weird post but I just wanted to vent a little. Thanks for reading. I think a hug would make me feel better,Depression
48001,Just a thought I decided . I will live life the way I want try new thing welcome only good hearted people into my life . If it didn't work out I can kill myself anyway. My body my choice !,Depression
15134,I wrote this just so fast and then decided to share it here. Some things might not make sense. I added notes to explain them. Is quite long.hey uhm no. not okay. that is not news. I feel like I need to do it take it. No not my life. The freaking pen. And just write.My essays and assignments. And then suddenly is not a matter of ideas but of endurance. For how long can I do this? For how long until I collapse?And keep going regardless of the answers.I am shaking. And I had all sorts of thoughts that owuld be qualified for a decent diagnosis. I think I have depression but I am so afraid of getting diagnosed. What do I want? A diagnosis?I just want it to be managed. And I can do that. Quietly. Without not so many people noticing. And its good then.I see their smiles and trust. I would not ever like to break it. Ha. Under normal conditions I would not. nowadays I sort of do not care. I am so numbI am fucking slow at realising stuff. I do and do and take for granted and think and think. And then yeah then I am on the speedrun or shut down mood. I am a student on one of those highly competitive programs? yeahI do not really know what I want. Do I want help? Do I need help? Regardless I do not have time for it. They say is just stress. Everybody goes through it you snowflake.So I waste my time at trying to feel better. Coping. Whatever.And then I can suddenly do it. Even if for a brief moment. I can do it. And its alright.I never know what to do exactly. Usually I just end up doing things. And that is bad.It can work. And people laugh. It does not work. And there is that frustrated silence.Why do they trust me so much? What they do not see that makes them believe in me? Why do everyone keeps saying I can?Right. Because I have before. I did it. Once. And i just it just went badly. But it was completed.And my fingers are cold as cold as that night. That night when I almost drowned in cold water. And solved some things bc I felt so so guilty. It should make me tremble nervous cry. But compared to all the previous things I have wrote here It kind of makes me calm.Death. Mom did you know I spent lots of time thinking about death? Aunt would it break your heart?Everyone am I just exaggerating this? right this is actually a valid concern is not it? I that is why I shared it here. I do not know if I want validation or to be told man upI am such a fake. With people that I am nice. With teachers a good student. Parents and family a usual angsty teen that is kind of happy and good at school.But you know who I am?I just have good ideas once and then.I take pride on them. I like them. And then ha. They die. Of course. Die as if they become uselessDie. die. die. die. And no this is not a joke. Not a joke.Not a joke. Not a joke. Not a joker. The Joker uh... I made a painting of him. And I am mostly funny with my friends... they sort of associate me a lot to that character. But as in a meme. it is not always a meme for me.This is though such a farse. I could not. All those times I tried were so damn ineffective. And I realise that is not what I want. I do not want to end it. I really do not want to have a gun around and kill myself with it. I do not want to because it will be stupid.Such a stupid thing for someone who just needs to cope and develop some good problem solving skills. I heard that is what I need plus to organize my timeAnd shit I am so damn exhausted. But what have I done? Shit. Nothing. Shit.Just do not do it. Remember Lovely by twenty one pilots? it is a song that makes me just snap out of circling. That happened herePlease uh wait. I just need to do shit. Not think. So take your pills you loony. I do not take pills but yesterday I saw a documentary on them and pills for anxiety panic attacks Zoloft for depression... I think that if I get diagnosed I will need to take them. And I just do not want to depend on them to liveTake them. Drug you. Smile. Do. Write. Get collected. Admissions.Oh this is quite a nice story is not it. Just. Die. Right. I do not mean actually taking my life. I mean... I just find it comforting to know that either way I will be old and then die. So maybe I do not need to take it. So maybe my time is more limited than I though. And maybe I can extend the good things for longer. Does that happen to any of you?Die but do shit before. And try not to tell anyone you want to die. Like yes. I want to make the most out of my life. I do not think people would respect me as much if I tell them that sometimes I think of stupid things like these. If I do have depression I have been hiding it for 4 years now. I am really got at lying you seeNo for Golden Child or Lost Child. Eh idk which rol I fullfil in my family. It worries me sometimes. Other's I just say No no my family is healthy but then again they do not know anything about any of this. And whenever they were close to finding out... Damn. do not you be all that way. Is frankly ridiculous.Just.. idk. Just do not. Just let your fingers get warmer. And listen to your teacher. And avoid getting there outside. While typing this I stopped shaking and feeling cold. I am on virtual math class. My brother went to take the rubbish outside. I do not handle responsibilities like those at home. I criticize myself a lot for it but at the end I cannot do it. Yet is also pretty much do not show your face to anyone So no help no Zoom camera no one at homeStay here. and do shit. Spinning Thoughts vent,Depression
16002,I either have to keep on finding ways around the panic and anxiety attacks to get my work done or battle the constant fatigue.I have learnt to exploit meditative techniques nutrition socialisation etc to deal with the panic and anxiety attacks. But I do not know what to do about the more physical things. I have night full of nightmares related to work stress. I wake up feeling like I have not slept. I feel nauseated and lightheaded for many hours after waking up I am on the SSRI Citalopram. The constant fatigue makes me want to turn my brain off completely if I could! But I fear napping or anything like that as sleep comes with a tonne of nightmares. Not to mention that sleeping during the day will mess up my daily cycle.I feel exhausted lightheaded and almost like I have been breathing through a narrow straw all day! I get these heaviness in my head and headaches from all that. Is there something I could be doing to get some energy back? I need to do intensive research work that is VERY taxing cognitively speaking. I desperately need the energy and the stability. How do you guys deal with the fatigue? It is destroying me.,Depression
38047,amp x 00b how do u deal with the loneliness when living alone how do u engage yourself who do u talk to i literally crave some human being to talk to but have only few friend,Depression
24064,Nothing makes me happy long term. Whenever things that do make me joy in the short term they ALWAYs lead to a nose dive of depression afterwards. I have crippling anxiety that does not seem to get any better not matter what I do.I understand that that is life. That all good things mush come to end. But that is the point. There was a quote about this from a show that I will never forget It goes that is exactly it are the best parts of life just finding momentary distractions to keep yourself busy so you do not think about the harsh reality of life for a second? I can ride roller coasters meet new friends and spend time with my family all day long. it is does not change the fact that... all of this was for nothing.I see a life I do not want. The way the economy is going constantly being burnt out living paycheck to paycheck having to put up with abusive bosses because I rely on them to survive. and quite frankly I do not see anything changing. The people at the top will continue to make everyone is life more miserable if it means they get to continue to live in luxury. If anything things are going to get worst.I am in the weird halfway point. I have made the decision that in two years time if nothing improves I am going to die. I do not want to mindlessly suffer just for the thin possibility that things might get better. Despite this I do not know if I want to die like I want to but then I will not be able to feel those little bits of joy. Conversely it will not matter because I will be dead. it is not I will be conscious to know what I am missing.As far as I know there is no afterlife. Many of the worlds religons say that there is a hell. I do not know. I am not relgious. So many people say so many different things that its impossible to know. I just hope that if there is a god that he is merciful and understand my mental suffering. When I posted my previous post in suicide watch my karama on the top of the page was 666 and when I got out bed I looked at the time it wsa 1134 and the 4 in my clock looks like an upside down h. Am I looking too much into this? Was it just a wild coincidence or is there some force beyond my control? I do not want to die I just do not want deal with the way life is. I need anther person's perspective.,Depression
26459,it is 1 pm I am still in bed and believe me or not I feel like crying because I do not want to get up. I do not have much to do today I just have a therapist appointment and I am happy to see him after 2 weeks but that also means that I will not be able to sleep this evening and it makes me feel sick... Also tomorrow I will go out with friends and I should be happy about it because I had a lot of fun last time and I could not wait to see them again but guess what... It makes me anxious because I will not be able to sleep in the evening. Sometimes I think that the time I spend sleeping or just in my bed hugging the pillow is the only thing that pushes me to keep going. Maybe it would not be so bad If I did not live with my father considering that sometimes I do not want to get out of bed just because I do not feel ready to face him and my grandma teasing me and treating me like a child. I feel that this discomfort would be a little less strong if I could just take my time to do things like having lunch organizing work in the evening going to bed eccetera instead of having to respect other's times noise and teasing all day long but that is another story... I just want to sleep,Depression
40174,the word kill yourself repeating in my mind every time i think of how fucked my life is,Depression
14774,I have been fighting back tears the last two days. I have no place I do not think I will ever be loved by anyone. I think my spouse is preparing to leave me. he is started talking to me and behaving the way my ex's did when they started cheating. Its been 6 months since he is even acted like he wanted to have sex with me. I just feel so rejected an used. I do not know what the point is if all I am is human garbage to be used and disposed of when things do not work like you want. I have been terrified the last week I am going to be fired.I just feel like I am drowning. What Am I Fighting For?,Depression
18072,I will give myself some time off to recover for a few days to just screw around and enjoy myself and I swear it makes me feel even worse or something. I do not get it...If my brain wants me to get things done so badly and feel accomplished why does it have to make me not want to do anything?What a vicious cycle... No matter how much I rest it never seems to help,Depression
14867,I sleep with a panda plushy in my arms against my chest. When I am mad disappointed in myself on the verge of a breakdown stressed anxious sad etc...

14858,Hmm how to put this this thing called love its just a fantasm created by humans to feel safe or idk I mean I did not see it heart it taste it smell it touch it or feel it so I really really do not understand people who believe in this thing which is 7 billion humans except 1? Or maybe not even 1. What I mean is that how can you devote ur life to someone or live with himher ur entire existence or Life. Lol I think that I will never understand. I think that love does not exist,Depression
12712,TIRED PISSED OFF ANNOYED that is my mood fot today!! WTF,Depression
25559,I 24M am a fat stout5'7 balding piece of shit who has a traumatic injury to the left eye and degeneration related changes in the right. Along with my childhood diagnosis of ADHD for quite a long time I have lost the will to live on. cannot hurt myself because it would hurt my parents but the desire to be alive and do anything worth at all keeps on lowering down further and further like drowning into a bottomless pool with light eventually fading out. The numbness is both painful and comforting at the same time.I am in a field which I love and respect and cannot complain having fared the pandemic relatively easier in comparison what horrors others have faced. Feels most the time I do not even exist. Just a substance less body floating through space goalessly. How do I regain this ever escaping will to do something or anything with my life and actually feel something other than this mindless pain? It feels like I have lost something important a very long time ago essential for the desire to keep moving ahead and cannot seem to relocate it. The voids keeps sucking back into misery no matter how hard I try.,Depression
14509,Every day I have really bad mood swings and its very hard to control and it often worries most of the people around me and I am honestly scared that they will leave me because of it does anyone know how to control mood swings better? I need help with mood swings,Depression
25624,now that I am planing my way to end my life I kind of stopped feeling like shitlike I know this hell is going to end soon so is kind of a reliefI actually want to try to experience something good in my last days so that my last thoughts do not be thinking about my pathetic life but it would be a shame if I become numbedidk I am probably not making any sense but all these years of deprrssion have consumed me and now I am just empty emptiness numbness?,Depression
9998,Why did I have to become physically deformed. My dad was gorgeous. My mom is gorgeous. My brother is handsome. I should have been movie star handsome. Instead my whole face is slanted because of a physical deformity that could have been prevented. I was bullied by kids because I have striking traits but they are mushed around my face. I just want to die every day. 23 years on this planet and still alone. This curse is proof there is no god. Why me,Depression
23066,One thing that helps me with depression is to just get up and go for a drive. Just drive,Depression
24497,I do not care that I am LaZy. I have been trying to restart my life for 7 years and my life now is only shittier than it was when I was 18. I have excercised dieted got hobbies gone to therapy. All of the things the drones constantly drone at you in these forums with their insipid generic platitude. I never succeeded. I always failed and each time stepped my face into the dirt once more. I do not believe in myself. I have ZERO self esteem. Since I was a kid I have had nothin to be proud of. Horrible hand eye coordination always picked last in sports ooor academic performance socially clueless. I hate myself. But more than that I despise everyone else. I want to go on a msss shooting and massacre a bunch of retards so that they will will feel terror and pani and maybe it would be cathartic. You are all so lucky I have not been able to get my gun license. I am poisonously envious of anyone with something I want. Intimate relationships friendships money a degree independence respect charisma beauty youth. If you have one of these things the best I can do is feign indifference. I cannot pretend to be happy for tlothers any longer. I wish them only the worst. I do not care about fairness. I do not care about who earned what. There is no such thing as deserve in a deterministic universe. I repeat I would love to horribly injure and ruin peoples lives not because they deserve it but because it would be cathartic for me. I would especially love to stab every cunt who has ever yttered the phrase pull yourself up by the bootstraps or other such normie fucktardstion. I am not interested in fitting into this society. I want every single person to die and for no more to come afterwards. Ah that would be an antnatalist paradise. I am done fighting,Depression
7813,Not sure if this is the best sub for this but I still think it is a good question.As someone who perhaps is not as socially skilled as it should be I watch a lot of selfimprovementsocial skills videos. The advice they give is say the things you do not think are worth saying or something along those lines to keep a conversation going. But my problem is I simply run out of things to say good or bad and I totally blank until the other person picks up the conversation.Is this something any of you relate to? Running out of things to say,Depression
22751,I know I should just feel enough. I know that I should not depend on what other people tell me and just do not care because everyone is different. But damn some things still stick like knives in the heart and the bit of self worth I have is so easy to break it is pathetic. Oh those insecurities how much I hate them,Depression
17023,I am just so down. I lost my job recently I drink all the time. I used to be an early riser and productive but now I can barely get out of bed before 2pm and barely have energy to shower clean or really interact with anyone.I do not plan on suicide but sometimes I just wish I was not around anymore. I feel like I have nothing good going for me. I know I have people that love me but I am just drained at this point. I wish I could was not around anymore but would not ever have the nerve to kill myself,Depression
21860,I do not have energy for anything I enjoy. The thought of doing something I enjoy gives me so much anxiety and guilt. Time flies by so fast I feel like as soon as I wake up the day is over an hour later. I wonder where my whole day went. I feel so worthless and overwhelmed. I am functioning only enough to keep my kids and myself alive. I want to feel alive so much. I do not feel anything at all sometimes Ill feel overwhelming sadness that is it. I feel love when I talk to my kids but one has autism and one has adhd I often wonder if they really do love me or if they love me only because I am all they have. Any advise on how to be alive and feel alive would be appreciated. Thank you Feeling very alone in this world.,Depression
11034,why do i feel depressed randomly for no reason? I had this time period like 2 months ago where i would randomly cry for no reason cuz i would miss my ex gf and even when i would not be thinking about her i would sometimes just start crying. and then it was great for a month and now something happened and it is starting again tho I am not crying as much mostlly only feeling depressed. It only happens when I am alone tho with no people around to talk around or if I am not doing anything like when i am overthinking it starts to happen again . How do i stop it i feel ashamed of myself for crying cuz I am a really buff guy and it would be weird for someone like me to have such emotions depressed ranomlly for no reason,Depression
7531,I am 20 year old male. I am struggling with depression for so long that i cannot even remember when i started feel depressed. I have been depressed my most of my life and never ever think that ending my life as a solution but in the past few mounths I have been thinking alot about killing myself alot because i cannot see a way out. I do not think I am going to be able to normal. I cannot even remember when i was normal like not even happy but normal. I am a virgin and never had any relationships. I have tried bunch of times but everytime i tried i got rejected friendzoned and sometimes got blocked. Last year i decided to stay platonic i said myself well if i do not propose i do not get rejected that worked not well but better than be heart broken. My past is full of pain and betreyal. My parents divorced because they cheated eachother. I was 14 when they got divorced and i kept all my anger inside then. I still keeping all of my anger inside because I am afraid to let it out i do not know what kind of monster would id be turning into and do not know if i ever be able to come back. Well that is my story thank you for reading it. I needed to write somewhere and this was the only place that come to my mind. is death really the only way out?,Depression
7269,Sometimes i feel better for about a week and then i just get depressed again. And when i mean feel bettee i more or less mean uncomfortable. Its so out of the blue and i just wonder why i suddenly feel stable and then i question so much. Its not really feeling better. I honestly do not know what it is but i do not like it. I mean i cleaned my room at least. Man this sucks! I hate when i feel better for a few days then fall right back into it,Depression
47359,I got a psychiatrist that says im going to be fine soon.But this life wouldnt be worth living if i dont get diagnosed with smthg. because then i got some solid proof i am the problem and not my brainchemicals I am not able to do anything had some mental breakdowns i am scared to call people or socialise even though i am a empath i keep extreme anger with me and cant controll it sometimes i just start to rage for small things cuz i feel like beeing on the edge at all times. I keep getting more hopeless the more days i life on this planet.Hyperfocused but then slow in thoughts and processing things.Hungry but not wanting to eat.Feelings of extreme tension and notknowing my future due to big problems with workeducation family relationships legal problems substance abuse traumatic stressful events happened often in my life disresepect from many people around me that think i am just a lazy looser too stupid to go to work and live a normal life that shit hurts bad when feeling i do everything my body could ampx200BThe moment i got myself some help was when my suicidal thoughts got really bad and kept cycling lots of times a day in my head and crying lying on the floor and sleeping too much without the good feeling of rest and beeing awake.ampx200BI had a dream days ago Of me beeing in a city and very very strong winds would blow the people seem to walk normal and dont feel the force but i feel it and need all my energy to take slow small steps people watch me and look at me like i was doing something wrong i felt like this describes how i feel best thank you subconscious theres alot of suffering included that i cant explain feelings of guilt not beeing able to move like everyone else i feel tho as it would be a good metaphor for people to understand my point of view.ampx200BI got a halfbrother that is rather unsupportive and just saying something if he complains or wants me to feel bad when i told him about my depression there wouldnt be much said but then after a few weeks he felt like he should joke a bit about that and not taking it serious. Well brother you are not invincible to depression take care in the future i told him and he shouldnt be like that because its A very serious and dangerous illness his mom had a suicide attempt and is schizophrenic but he still doesnt understand the situation for me . I think he is a stuck soul and using narcissist behaviour to feel better about himself.Ive seen things when i was younger that a child wasnt supposed to see.ampx200Bfor example A friends sister was a heroin addict and i saw her tripping hardcore with 811 years of age.I saw real and brutally disturbing footage of ISIS and 2 people get decapitated with chainsaw and a knife with 11 years.I saw some other nasty footages of suicides and other things that you shouldnt watch as a kid horror movies aswell but they were not as disturbing Took some LSD when i was older then the friend of a friend came homewho was a hunter with a plastic bag and the head of a baby deer bloody nasty and not good when your on LSDIve always had problems with my family and respect due to conflict with everything outside my home and then coming home and listening to financial problems of my mom and how my dad betrayed her and sht just overloaded me ALWAYSAll that stuff is terrible and if u have kids dont let them ever live a life like that u are fcked real bad afterwards. My brain is not the same i have mental breakdowns nearly everyday. And suicidal ideation is just the good part of it.ampx200BI feel like my thoughts are hella aggressive and dark sometimes when i just see words like bloodthirst bloodshed i seem to calm down and Im good is this how my brain copes with things now? it needs trauma and horrifying things to calm down?ampx200BI watch myself as a person that tries its best to keep going but not having people that understand mental illness and not providing support in a healthy way.. And bad things happen to me all the time but i keep going cuz the immortality of our soul is not bound to this earth but to the universe so you cant escape not even with deleting yourself.ampx200BI feel like i cant ever escape but it somehow is good to deal with my problems rather than ignoring them.ampx200BEdit I guess i wasted my time now but it feels like i cleaned some emotions up. Cheers moderator ,Depression
25116,I am in quite a slump as in today I am really feeling depressed and alllllll I want to do is go back to bed. While this is perfectly OK I also wanted to make sure I do some stuff before shutting down and avoid some self guiltshame. I sent off my photograpy portfolio and I am going to chuck together a potato and chickpea curry to let simmer until lunch. Today that is what doing my best looks like. Bring on the Buzzfeed unsolved marathon. Wby? What does your best look like today?,Depression
7592,So my parents have this thing where they will take a long time to let minor wrongdoings go. They hold all my small inconveniences over my head and it makes me feel awful. For example they started yelling at me for being ungrateful about the help they give me which is completely untrue by the way and when I started to fight back because I am done with just sitting down and taking it they hold it over my head for at least the rest of the day. It makes me feel like nothing I do is good enough for them. How do I deal with this? Whenever I try to talk to them about anything wrong that they do they always get angry about it. What do I do? Parent issues,Depression
13162,I feel lost. All I do is stay at home all day. I would like to go somewhere but I do not know where to go to. What is there to do in life? Like what do normal people do with their free time? It cannot just be going to bars and restaurants and shopping malls all the time. There has to be more to this life... Or maybe I am expecting too much out of it. What do normal people do?,Depression
47753,I want to get out of this dumb brainrotting placebit of vent sorry I want to talk to my friends and they talk back and we have a fun and nice time. I want to be happy and drink water and get up early and go to university every day and go to work. I. Cant. Do. It.I have 0 support except my girlfriend but i cannot class her as any kind of psychological support. I am going back on my meds soon because i was okay for a while wo them but Ive been really really bad. its like i have a baseline feeling of sadness and not good but then it really worsens for no reason just from the most random triggers.I want to be fucking normal! My social skills have been fucking depreciating so bad aswell like i just want to have a nice chat maybe but i just push people away and i want to not do that!!!!,Depression
26035,I do not deserve to be given life privilege what the fuck am i doing with myself,Depression
7285,Posting here mostly as a last resort since I feel like I bother others when I talk about my depression. I am a 23 years old girl and feel like a loser. I have suffered from depression for as long as I can remember which was made worse when I was a teenager due to drug useexcessive drinking being sexually assaulted and briefly working as a sex worker although in a pretty sketchy way. I feel like no one cares. I feel like my friends do not really give a shit about me or would not care if I was not around. I feel like my band sucks even though I put so much of myself into it. I feel like people think I am stupid. I fear I may actually just be stupid. I feel unremarkable worthless. I have not attempted suicide in many years but sometimes I feel I am getting there again. I feel unhappy in my relationships and I think the problem is and always will be me. I try DBT and am on antidepressants. Any advice is appreciated. 23 yo really depressed and feel lost.,Depression
8192,Hey Everyone I am depressed. Can anyone tell me what to do? I want to book an appointment with psychologist. Tell me what to do..,Depression
10778,I grew up poor and came to realize the only thing that will make someone happy is money. it is all I give a shit about.I am trying to become a nurse so I can have a high income and if I fail then there is no point in me trying anymore.Rent is skyrocketing around America healthcare is damn near impossible to afford and their saying us Gen Z will never retire. MONEY IS ALL THAT MATTERSAnd before anyone says Money will not buy you happiness or Fulfilment is what makes you happy you are fucking deluding yourself and you should be ashamed if you go around telling people that.When I see rappers like Lil Boosie flat out say money is the key to happiness I believe him not you! When I see comedians like Daniel Tosh get up on stage and say Of course it buys happiness There the ones that are right not your dirt poor ass. Without money I will end up killing myself,Depression
41193,nhsuk the issue with this a a formerly obese person is the jolly fat folk persona i wasn t amp all those i know amp help are not happy being fat it is a myth put out by the food industry suggesting we are happy being metabolically unhealthy the depression caused is astronomical,Depression
26705,When the rose colored glasses come off and you realize those you thought were your closest most important parts of your social life do not actually care much about you at all. How am I supposed to trust someone is actions as pure and honest when their words are so demeaning and vindictive. I grew up with the mindset that a drunk mans thoughts is a sober ones words is this applicable to when we are angry? Sure we all say things we regret after the fact that are said in the moment but what happens when it is not a one time mistake but a habitual routine? How do you force yourself to move on from these moments and not let your brain play them on repeat. I am still young but still somehow feel so fucking bitter to the point where I daydream about cutting everyone out of my life again and moving somewhere new. I am tired of feeling like I am just constantly looking for things to bother me or feeling degraded by being upset by things I am told are my own fault. If you did not say such dumb things I would not have to treat you like a dumb person.,Depression

22346,I see a lot of these i feel lonely posts on this subreddit and i feel the same way but i also feel kind of a hypocrite when i say so because I have lost so many friends lately because of multiple factors going on with my country and some people moved on or were never the type to keep contact or care which is fine i made peace with that idea. But i also withdrew from other relationships because of the fear of being hurt the possibility that i would be backstabbed again or potentially losing more people. I used to give so much effort and time and was really engaging with others now I am the total opposite and i have this self defense attitude that i cannot seem to shake or make other understand why I am behaving this way. In a way I am wishing for someone who resembled the old me in friendships to magically come along so i can open up to and be myself again instead of biting the bullet and hope for the best. Maybe someone can relate,Depression
14645,I moved cities 3 years ago for a new beginning. Had an internship where I received free filmmaking classes. Had a job. I had a plan on how to make it and reach my goals. I got depressed then lost two jobs along the way and dropped many college classes. Now I am leaving this city to go to a university that was my second pick and I am scared that Ill forever live in this loop of things going great at first then depression ruining things. I am scared I am being naive that things could get better. I have thought about suicide so many times over these last few years. I just do not want to get my hopes up that my life will actually be worth living. I have never been in love or had a girlfriend or my first kiss. I hope I can find love because it has not gone well for me at all. I hope I can find myself again. I am majoring in Englishcreative writing with the goal of finding my artistic voice again and becoming a better writer. The school I am going to is low ranked due to my grades not being perfect enough to get into my dream school. Another thing depression took from me. I was once a straight A student. I am scared all Ill ever be is someone who is simply surviving. If that is the case I might as well kill myself. I am trying to give life a chance once again but I am scared. Life just keeps kicking me down. I just feel this undertone of depression all the time realizing the opportunities depression took from me,Depression

14606,Its hard to go day by day lacking confidence and not liking yourselffrom your body to your personality. And I know I am supposed to practice selflove and pull myself up from the bootstraps but I do not know how. Just lacking motivation confidence and selflove all at once. I am a mess I was so happy before the pandemic amp now I just hate myself,Depression
38516,i m not sure if this a thought process shared by few or many but it s one i wanted some clarity on i ve suffered with mental illness since my later high school year and and now starting my rd year of university i have ambition and desire and all the intent in the world to do good with myself and be the best i can be i have goal not super defined which i think is a result of my illness but i just can t bring myself to really go for it i ve been skipping class cause of anxiety issue whilst simultaneously being completely aware of how much of my life is being wasted away because my brain won t let me do what i want to do is this a common thing it s a complete self awareness of what i m doing wrong but an incapability to change it really would like some thought on this,Depression
48294,I got the big sad but I prefer it that way I 24 m for the past 10 years have been pretty depressed since I grew up moving home to home among my relatives constantly being around drugs and alcohol. Since I move around a lot I can't get a real attachment to anyone which is sad for me with the exception is my GF of 7 soon to be 8 years. But I lately I've begun to realize that I feel more comfortable being a depressed guy than happy it's more like I rather be sad and tired so others can be happy. For example my gf's family have taken me in as their own even giving me the nickname Mikwap meegwap which roughly translated to home in our language. Anyways I wouldn't say no to them when they asked something of me. Nothing too crazy simple things like small chores that theirs children refuse to do lend them money when they need or drive 4 hours for an event. There are more things. But I do stuff like this for my actual family too and it's making me feel drained mentally and physically which leeds to my depression. I don't have a lot of time to myself and I struggled with nearly becoming an alcoholic. I sacrifice myself like this because I want to see everyone smile and be comfortable especially the children in both families. I don't want them to have a hard life moving around or being around drugs and alcohol. Lately my gf has been telling me not to worry about everyone so much and take time to myself. I considered it but I'm worried something will happen if I'm not around to help. I'm at work right now while I type this. And would like some outside opinions. Also I'm sorry about the title I just use small amounts of humors to hide my depression,Depression
37973,to clarify i guess i wa only happy because i wa really high but i stopped for a minute and started thinking i wa thinking about who i am and how much of a sad useless piece of shit i am i wa hanging out with a few people at the time so i had to shake the thought pretty quickly fuck i wish i could just forget who i am altogether i m getting tired of me,Depression
38374,do you guy also have the unbearable urge to just step out of your door one day and leave i can t take it anymore i tried for year to get happy or at least not miserable but all i do creates more critic and now i m not even at peace when i m home i have no hope finding peace success or even stability at home and just vanishing seems to be the only thing left to try sometimes i just wan na get in my car fuel it up and leave everyone and everything behind sleeping in the car and go wherever sadly i wouldn t even have the money to even last a month,Depression
9407,I have moved to a new city during lockdown a year back and while my parents come visit every weekend I am pretty friendless other than my crazy dogThey live in another city 34hrs away and the cops are making traveling difficult thanks IndiaI work freelance so I do not really have coworkers cannot move back home because of said crazy dog love her to death. But I have no social life. I am an introverted 27year old girl who lives in the middle of what feels like bumfuck nowhere. I feel like I am waiting for life to begin and just the thought of wasting time gives me a headache. I have been crying at the drop of a hat for inconsequential things. I also feel like I have no one to talk to. Jeez I can go on but maybe I should stop. Clearly I have issues talking about myself because I think I sound too whiny.. idk help? Maybe I am depressed maybe I am lost. I do not know if I need help.,Depression
7778,The memories I suppressed for so long suddenly triggered today. I remembered how I used to feel like I was trapped in my own world and how i was suicidal in junior school at around age 10. I remember how my mum used to go into rage at mistakes i would make or me being annoying. I remembered how mum would tell me to put my arm out for her to hit me and if i pulled my arm back in fear she would threaten to hit me even harder. I was really fucked up back then. Every other night Id think about running away never having to face anyone who would hurt me or berate me or make fun of me like my classmates and teachers at school would or like my mum would at home. I think today was the day my old self that i had abandoned to heal finally came back to haunt me. Just needed to write this down. I just needed to write this down,Depression
22676,I have tried to use music as an outlet to express my struggle but when your brain is such a clusterfuck it is impossible to write something that explains what you are feeling that is coherent and even sounds remotely good. But I guess that happens when you are worthless at everything. Why is it so fucking impossible to know and express what you feel.,Depression
15874,Over the last couple of years I have lost the will to live. I just do not see the point in doing anything anymore. My job has become redundant but I do not wish to change as I do not think any other job is going to be better than the one I have. I cannot hang out with my close group of friends as they are either getting married or are in a serious relationship. Cannot socialize anywhere else due to the restrictions brought about by the pandemic. To prevent feeling lonely I hang out with a group of people who are at least 57 years younger to me. But deep down I feel out of place as they are in a different phase of life and have different interests. No other interests or hobbies. All this makes me lose interest in my life further.For a while I thought I was under a depression as this feeling of nothingness came on suddenly. I convinced myself that the depression is the reason my life is at a low point.But recently I met a person who was diagnosed with clinical depression. That is when I realised what depression actually is. Compared to what the guy was facing my life was a picnic. I had no problem in functioning and going about my daily life. For a brief moment I was relieved that I was not under depression.However then the realisation hit me If I am not depressed then there is only one explanation for this funk in my life I am just pathetic. Ironically this realisation of being a pathetic loser made me feel worse than when I thought I was depressed. At least when I was depressed I could go to a psychologist and get myself treated. Being pathetic has no solution. It is just the way I am....If any of you are wondering about relationships..I have never had any. Not a single one. It is difficult for me to even maintain good relations with family members. I do not know how to read and react to social situations. All this while my justification for the lack of social skills was due to having Asperger's or some other autism. But now I even doubt that...maybe I just too pathetic to do anything other normal people do. Just realised that I am not depressed. Just pathetic.,Depression
27017,I am so exhausted and the only way out is suicide. i hate thinking about my future because I hate being alive and I do not want to live a shitty life.Not even drugs or alcohol is helping meI do not even know why I am still aliveim so fucked dude i cannot wait until i finally kill myselfi have no desire to live anymore there is no point anyways.ampx200Bis there anything i can do to help my mental exhaustion so i can atleast feel a little better I am so mentally exhausted and nothings working,Depression
47180,My mother treats me like shit and I keep going back Im 21 f and my mom 61 me and her never had the best relationship going ever since maybe a kid and even more now. Growing up it hurts that your mom and dad argue violently over the phone about their relationship and who doesnt want to keep me back and forth I would cover my ears and rock even growing up I was very very munched bullied told my mom and nothing would be done even told her as a 10 year old I wanted to unalive ignored me even told her a lot of time growing up and I didnt have my dad alot due to him being on drugs and in and out of prison and my mom being upset about it losing her soulmate and going to my dad they have a very very rocky relationship and marriage and they couldve been better off divorced even. One time she and him went all out on it changing locks separated even her leaving me with my little sister for weeks to see random men she just met but took each other back my mom has bully me about my weight even called me a hoe a bitch a disappointment and how much she wants me out of her house and everything hurts my feelings even calls my undiagnosed very much have it adhd a retard Thing a problem and I have adhd and tells my dad about it like Im. Such a retard. She even threatened me many times to put me out a girl whos does everything she ask for went to school getting decent or good degrades first to grad high school soon college and in college to be a teacher but she wants to put me out and everything and not my 40 year old brother who literally has nothing going for him and has the nerve to call him the better child even though they rarely get into he calls her out her name and she does too I never done that to her no matter how mad Iam I dont know what I did wrong my heart hurts. I seek attention from the wrong crowd from men from anybody just to be groomed to feel all sweet and happy in my heart and All I wanted is motherly love and a healthy relationship we do then something happens and Im getting hurt naked called fat she and more my dad sometimes agree with her and even takes her side its rare when he takes my side hes even worse at times I have mental breakdowns from them and even cry myself to bed wanting a loving relationship with them. Even had a few work mothers who I enjoyed it fills a hole in my heart even because of them they call me the sweetest names and talk to me about my issues than her brushing it off even my dad calling me weak all because of this I gained age regression and find comfort from this at late nights or when Im all very much alone,Depression
10215,Hello everyone. I kindly ask you to fill up my survey about YOUR experience with DEPRESSION. It will help me with my research paper.Thank you! SURVEY,Depression
11706,I have struggled with depression for almost 20 years. Now it feels different. It feels stronger it feels darker. I can see my reflection in the mirror but I do not know who I am. Who was I before? Am I even any different? Sleep used to be my escape from myself but my dreams are vivid and awful now. The anxiety has crept into my unconscious. I am alone inside of myself. I have been taking lamictal for 15 years and recently I have gone without them for a few weeks due to unfortunate circumstances. I know I am experiencing withdrawal from them. My mind is foggy and distracted. I cannot concentrate on even a television show I enjoy. The things that used to soothe me are no longer working. Every day is the same as the last in my mind. I tried to quit smoking cigarettes...but I cannot seem to let go of them. My therapist has me confused and scared about what could be wrong with me mentally. I have broken up with a very close friend because they accused me of being selfish and toxic. Maybe I am. But I am just trying to survive. I do not want to die. I just want to be okay. I cannot work. My finances are being taken care of by my 60 year old mother who works overtime to support me through this. I am forever grateful for her sacrifice. The shame of not being able to support myself as an adult is weighing heavy on my self worth and esteem. I am in a very dark place and I am afraid. Sometimes I lay in bed and think about all the people in the world and how a lot of them feel lost or scared or just empty like me. How can I be on this planet with so many people and feel completely isolated. My friends love me. My family loves me. My boyfriend loves me. I know this. But it does not cure me. I am my own enemy. My mind is a prison and I silently scream internally every day. how is that for dramatic? I cannot find the words to express myself,Depression

19543,Hi there! I am new here and I hope this is okay to ask. I 21f struggle with symptoms of depression due to ADHD and anxiety but my boyfriend 23m mainly struggles a lot with depression. Hes been traveling for work for about three months now he visited two weeks ago and seemed very happy to be home. He recently got switched over to another job the company he works for basically sends him and his team to different jobs as they are needed and he hates it. Hes working from 3am3pm and I cannot even imagine how hard that must be. Hes been struggling a lot and I am really trying to support him and stay positive but its really hard sometimes. He barely talks to me. The most I have gotten to talk to him in the last two weeks is for 10 minutes a day. I want to be loving and understanding because I understand how hard this is for him but I am at a crossroad. Mainly because while I get this is very hard for him it is for me too. As someone with anxiety and some trauma from past relationships I have communicated to him that I need at least a little bit of time to check up on him and talk to him. 20 minutes is enough for me. But hes been saying that because hes been depressed he does not ever really feel like talking. I totally get that and I do not want to because him any stress but by doing that I am causing myself and my mental health a lot of pain. I know we can work through this but I would really appreciate some insight or advice on this. Anything will help. Partner with depression,Depression

I have someone who is been a part of my life for a VERY long time but every time I try to talk to him about the fact that I have been struggling he talks over me to tell me how bad its been for him lately. Like if I say I am doing bad hell go me too. And then ramble on about everything that is going on in his life. I have tried to talk to him about it and all he said was Well I have got a lot going on in my life right now. Hope things get better though. And if I text him anything about my issues like just to complain or get it off my chest hell ignore me and when I call him out he just says Its a lot to process. I am busy Am I a bad friend for just wanting him to listen to me? Its so hard for me to open up and I feel like he does not care at all?? Friends advice,Depression
14072,I am 18 M finished year 13 two months ago in May after assessments. I dreaded every single day in school ever since September 2020 because I saw my ex alot we were in 2 classes together. I did have friends but they were more like class mate type not the close type. My close friends I had before I do not really speak to them anymore and now I am basically alone but I do have my family.I got some good grades which the good feeling only lasted for a couple of daysI thought my life would brighten up once the last day of that school was over...I was thrilled for 3 days and then just got caught up in a lot of Netflix gaming feeling empty lots of thinking about why I cannot just better my parents and teachers had hope on me but I am just a bum in my eyes. And also questioning why I cannot be better than my ex I got declined by all the medical schools I applied for. Everyone is of to uni and I feel like I am being left behind and that will be the story for the rest of my life.Looking at myself in the mirror I have gained a little bit of weight but nothing major. But I still feel uglier the lack of jawline six pack stuff.I feel so much loneliness everyday even happy bright songs about love make me feel like shit.Some people on Reddit have said to work on myself it is hard. Everytime I fail I feel like I just fall a step further down.The only thing I really do some what consistently is music production but I am nothing near being at industry level where I can make a living. That gives me reason to believe I have no talents. In my head anyone can do what I do I do not feel special at all.The other thing I do consistently is think negatively and feel lonely afTLDR what do you do if your life does not get better?I feel like there is no point me carrying on and living if my life is just full of loneliness failure talentless and always feeling what ever you do is insufficient. I feel like my life will not get better.,Depression

25890,Why did I have to be born into an abusive household. I am done pretending I have had a great childhood my father was a prick shit fuck and left me with issues that caused me to never have friends and he gets away with it. He left the fucking country so he does not need to pay child support so we everyday struggle for money. And when i feel like everything is going well i get reminded that we had touched me a little boy whenever my mum was out and my sister never helped. What the fuck did i do wrong? I try being there for others but because of how I behaved in school people hated me. I just wanted to be noticed or to have some little power in my life for once. I ended up leaving school too early and was dumped by the education system as they did not want to help.Not that anything matters now i just need to vent typing this out helps in a bizarre unusual way. I am too worried to go to therapy. I was under cahms when i was younger and all they did was worsened things and betrayed me so therapy is possibly worse. I do not want to be diagnosed with anything i just want to believe I am normal?. I had a girlfriend for a year believe it or not i still wonder how. does not matter she used me and cheated on me because again i must deserve this for no particular reason. I am done venting now sorry for that. Why me?,Depression

I have I need something to do but I cannot stop crying. it is all silent too because I do not want any damned speech about how this is all my fault and that I should have expected this. I know all that shit already. it is practically a worn trench in my mind at this point. All that does is push me more to become an alcoholic an inevitability at this point.And if it is not the little condescending spats it is the pointed accusiations or laughs at me being a damned crybaby. it is like that with every emotion tears or smiles or whatnot.Please I just want that emptiness back. At least it is safer than any of the alternatives. I just want to be the little robot they all want me to be. that will get me till I am old enough to die of mysterious circumstances or an accident. Whichever comes first I do not care. The emptiness was nice,Depression

20814,My gf and I broke up my family how my dad just had fucked me up for so long I have one bestfriend but truthfully I feel like when I am down nobody wants to deal with it. I just feel alone man. For once ya know. I may sound pessimistic but I am stressed. I am 24 in debt moving out because I cannot be in this house with an abusive dad anymore no college degree only one friend who does not feel like he cares as much as he should or feels awkward when I am down so its just me. I have no one to talk to.I feel like everyone hates me. I feel like a loser. I just feel like total shit. People usually have family or at least a family member to be there for them. People usually have lots of friends to care for them when they are down. Me no. I feel like I am socially inept. Like I am too fucked up to be around anyone. Like I am just nothing. I totally feel like I cannot do shit. People act like they care ya know and tell me the most obvious things. Like it will be okay or everything is fine but for me it does not feel like that. For them being okay is just breathing. I just feel empty. I wish I had friends who cared for me who had love. No matter how stupid that sounds because that is all I need. A family that has love. But all around me is just negativity and all these heavy labels and expectations. It destroys me how people think so shitty of me. When everyday I feel like I go out of my way to try. When I believe in my heart that no matter what Ill be there for my friends family and my girlfriend with all my heart forever. And its just not like that. Nobody feels that way for me. No matter how embarassing or sad this sounds its the truth of how I feel. And I feel like total shit. And all I need is love for once. I never got it as a kid. People say at least you have a dad and family. But a dad who abused me my whole life. Who still just talks shit about me. A sister who treats me like total shit. A mom who is so destroyed by an abusive husband who has the best heart but is so hurt she drinks all night every night and cries. A girlfriend who says she cares and loves me but always has to put me down and say she is going to end it. All the friends I had that just ditched me who was just a friend to be around me or make plans. Where for once is the love. Honestly. When can I finally have somebody there for me through hard times? Even if I am a dick sometimes I am human. I am always there when people treat me like shit. But once I do something wrong its the end of the world. Everyone expects me to be perfect. To have everything done perfectly. Like I am some fucking robot man. No free time just all my time spent to please everyone and work hours on hours to bring money in to give to everyone else too. To just say I have money. To just say I did this and that and I do not give a fuck about money. I do not care to have money to flaunt and just act successful. But that is what everyone expects of me. To be perfect. While I have been just trashed on my whole life. Elementary school being made fun of for being overly energetic and wanting attention because at home I just got the shit beat out of me. Made fun of because I am Japanese. Middle school just made fun of because I am the weird shitty kid who acts stupid because I just want people to like me because nobody fucking does. because I get trashed on by my dad and family and whole school. Being a fucking outcast. Idk man. I feel like total shit. Girlfriend knows how hard my life is now. she is went through it with me but she cares about herself so much. does not see how much pain I feel because I do not show it. because I do not want to cry everyday and whine because everybody has told me to man up and grow up anytime I feel like this. I feel broken man. Feel totally alone lost and destroyed,Depression

15124,Hi everybody excuse my english but its not my first language I hope to be clear.Tw self harmMy 19f little sister 15 is living a pretty bad moment in her life her relationship with our father is complicated and she does not have friends to talk to.Our parents separated 4 years ago and she says it did not bother her but I know it is not true I also had mental health issues due to the separations and I see a therapist to deal with them. My mom is always kind but she does not get this type of things like anxiety and depression so my sister does not open you to her. My dad is a literal narcissist and shouts and says mean things at every mistake we make I learnt growing up not to get offended or considerate his insults but I know how much it hurts to be called an idiot and a delusion from someone who is supposed to make you feel home.I am the only one who my sister opens up to but I do not know how to help her.One month ago we found out she cuts herself and dad got angry at her i talked to her and i reassured her but i do not know what to do. She said it was the first time I know it is not true but I did not say anything that could make her feel wrong of bad. I always talk to her and I listen but she says she does not know how to feel she feels numb and cannot sleep. Sometimes she is more chill and sometimes she is very mean to me. When she treats me badly I get angry I know I should maybe be more patient but she can be very mean.If you can give me some advice thank you so much. My sister is depressed how can I help,Depression

It feels really shitty to essentially be ganged up on and kicked out of a community where I had been nothing but polite. The whole discussion was just over if Transgendered is actually grammatically correct to say. I guess the mods did not like that I said technically it was so is not an insult. Now I am banned after I was the one fending of all the insults. It makes me feel so alone. All I can think is nobody wants you anywhere. Nobody wants at all.

9228,I think am going through depression.All i want to do is cry whilst all my day is filled with me meeting other people and pretending to be mentally okay.I would give everything for someone who loves me to hold me and say I am okayand not crazy.I cannot tell any of my friends cuz i will sound annoying and they will say i am overreacting so i must suffer through this alone.Tomorrow i am meeting my nephewsecond cousin who is 3.I do not have an option but to act as if i am perfectly fineas i should be.I mean i have amazing gradesgoing in a prestigious schooli have the perfect family and friends.I think it all started 3 weeks ago.For about 5 days i was in a very bad state.Then a friend of minelet us call him Gtexted me and i helped him deal with relationship difficulties.Somehow that made me feel good about myself and i was happy for 2 weeks.Now they got back together and I am even happierbut the feeling of darkness returned.When i do not have anyone to care or worry for i feel useless.I am a very antisocial person so i do not have many friendsalthough at school everyone likes me.But for those friends i would give everything.You see G was the person i texted the most with.He stayed honest and very truthful to me which I am grateful for.He said how he felt which warmed my heart.The only think killing me from the inside is that i could not tell him the depths of my feelings.We talked about lots of thingsi even shared childhood drama so he feels better.Yes i sometimes joked that i was going through somethingexpecting something more of a reaction.Silly me.Now that the little bird has flown out the nest I am back to crying.He is my closest person and i cannot tell him how i really feelscared of his reaction and the thought that he might want to stop contacting me.Something i am experiencing once again.What the hell is wrong with me what is wrong with me?,Depression
17134,I am 22. My whole life I have struggled with mental illness. Everyday I struggle with severe anxiety and depression. Sometimes I also struggle with suicide. Its gotten so bad that I finally convinced my parents to be okay with me going to the doctors to try medication. My appointment is coming up and my parents keep making their disapproval evident. They are extremely against medication for mental illness but they are tolerating it because they blame my depression and anxiety for why I am such a disappointment in their eyes. However they are still not happy abt it. When I first talked to them abt it I thought they were finally on my side but it does not seem that way anymore. Its just really hard when it feels like your parents are against you. It especially sucks cuz I have actually been on kind of a mental high lately but this has really brought it all crashing down again. My Parents Are Mad At Me For Needing Medication,Depression

17319,During the day when I have to interact with others I basically always play a role that masks my inside. I change my behaviour topics I talk about and to some extent even vocabulary according to the person I talk to. As soon as I am alone I feel just empty again I am feeling like I have no personality at all. During the day I play a functioning human during the night I suffocate in self loathing self harm urges and suicidal fantasies.When I laugh or talk about whatever it is only superficial. It does not really stimulate my brain my emotions are only shallow and short living. I feel like I am just playing roles while being completely empty inside.,Depression

And think of moving out to somewhere else. it is happening again and again. A lot of hate inside me,Depression
22914,I really need to vent. I need somewhere to let this out. Forgive me if I ramble. it is been hard to focus. Today has been especially difficult. I woke up and I have been laying in bed with my lights off most of the day.. close to a year and a half ago I lost both of my children because I was unfit.. my mental health as well as having ended up in a relationship that nearly cost me my life.. several times. I felt trapped and lost everything before I could get myself together enough to get out.. now I am 25 back at my mother's house and only seeing my girls once a week for an hour.. the other day when planning my weekly visit their father texted me that I would be unable to see them this week because they were in a wreck and totaled the truck.. he said the girls were fine but he could not even call me.. it made me realize that I was so far gone that he could not even be bothered to tell me that our children were involved in a car wreck.. Today I suppose it all finally settled in. Anytime I would exit my room for anything my mother would put me on the spot in front of everyone. I am fine I would say. To which her response was always something snarky followed by well you do not look fine. I do not like when people point it out when I am like this.. it makes me feel small.. my voice is never heard because someone always has it worse. I agree but that does not mean I am not in pain.. so I closed myself off and began to sob again... my step dad who I have never really bonded with came into my room and allowed me to talk.. then he spoke. Shared some information that he had not even shared with my mom about his past and his mental health struggles.. it was nice. Then my mom came in upset because he did not tell her where he was going.. began to joke and play around like everything was fine. He had to tell her that this conversation was not about HER.. she took that as a joke also.. she expressed that her and my grandfather had been discussing therapy and medication options for me. Which I am opposed to and she is aware. I can function like a normal person.. I just have my days where I cannot hold it in anymore.. When my step dad left I had to endure being her personal therapist because she had the blahs and I am not the only one that suffers.. I need encouragement.. I just need hope.. something. Kind words needed,Depression
15301,I was with my family at a restaurant. My grandma was there too. I started a fight with my mom and then started crying could not stop. All I could think about in that moment was ending my life. I came home and just went to sleep. Now I am awake and ashamed I keep hurting people around me. I do not know what is wrong but I do not think I will get better. I wish I just had the courage to end it. it is all I think about when something bad happens. I feel really bad for everyone. It must be really confusing and scary living with a monster like me. I feel like I will lose everyone in my life. it is only a matter of time. I do not want to trouble anyone any longer. Created a scene,Depression

20986,Tw rpe..Hello guys I know it is weird to post this here but I do not really know anywhere else to vent my frustration.I am an almost 22 year old female but 5 years ago I was in a very very toxic dangerous and abusive relationship with a 18 year old that shortly after we finally broke up red a 12 year old boy. He sent me pictures of them together and all that type of fucked up shit. It was very traumatic and to this day it haunts me.I finally spoke up about the situations I went through and de rpe of the kid about 2 years ago mainly out of fear. I got a lot of backlash for not speaking up earlier I got called many ugly things but the thing that hit me the worst was that this guy had a female best friend that we will call C.C called me a liar and defended my abuser in any way she could denying he would ever do such horrible things despite having screenshots of how abusive he was to me and literally pictures of him with the kid he abused. She also called herself a feminist and her standing against me put lots of other women against me so I ended up deleting every post where I talked about what happened and even deleted my old Facebook and Instagram accounts for that reason. Police where involved in this too but I dropped the charges I just did not want to know anything about this anymore. Now this was 2 years ago but today I was scrolling down Instagram and stumbled across C's art account and while I was looking at her drawings I saw she had made Sally face fanart and talked about how much she loved the game and Sal the main character of the game.I really do not like gatekeeping and I understand she has the right to like whatever she wants just like I do and the more people know and play Sally Face the better as it is an indie game and I want the creator to receive as much support as possible.But this really hit me like a bucket of cold water. I know I should not have gone through her account but I was not expecting to see this at all. Now I cannot stop myself of thinking of both C and my abuser whenever I see something related to the game. I know it is stupid but I feel like one of my favorite things was taken off me or at least stained by all those memories and I feel awful. It is ruined. My depression has been acting up the last few days I think it has to do with the cold and cloudy weather as it is winter where I live and I always seem to have a harder time during cold seasons and this just made me feel even worse I feel like I cannot escape them or the memories. I have been in bed all day crying. it is pathetic. I am an adult crying over someone else liking my favorite game. I found out my abuser's best friend is a fan of my favorite indie game and I have been crying all day,Depression

25801,Most subs do not understand this whenever i say this but i just cannot take it anymore. These two people I run into in one of my favorite games and modes within said game and it is just the worst experience ever whenever I play against them. They spam laugh they taunt they talk shit to us in chat and they win every single game every single time and I just want to slit my wrists every time. I put so much time and effort in taking the little oppurtunities i have for fun to the highest degree but the game just gets ruined every time. I then start connecting it to my own worth and i want to just end it all I have cut because of it in the past. These people will never understand never stop never get consequences and i want to die. Running into the same people in a game and it makes me want to waste away and die.,Depression
48177,I 15F cannot do this shit anymore. Major TW Suicidal talk Its midnight. I have to get up at asscrack early tomorrow. I cant go to sleep because of how fucking anxious I am. I feel like everyone fucking hates me and tolerates me for some reason. Maybe because theyre scared maybe some sort of pity I dont know. Im sick of being yelled at whenever Im at home Im sick of it all. I cant do this. I want out so badly but I cant get away. I cried in school today because she screamed at me in the car. She didnt care at all. Does anyone fucking care? People say they do but realistically theres no reason. I wish people would just get it out of the way and stop being fucking pussies and just tell me if they had an issue so I could stop being a fucking burden. Im pissed and Im scared and I hate myself and I hate people around me and I wish I could just end it all right here and right now but I cant because IM TOO MUCH OF A PUSSY. The closest thing I can do is starve myself and throw my guts up which is a fun little tradition that Ive had for over a year. Thankfully my mother being the kind soul she is tells me that is bad and will make me fat. Thanks mom! Im just so sick of this. Im powerless and weak and I know I am and I wish I had access to a rope right now. Ill probably forget all about this in the morning too its just that today was a fucking hell day.

21479,My life has been slowly going downhill for 3 months. i got fucking screwed by my job and now i only have 10 after working for a month to only make rent got hit with rent and bill increases and now supposedly have stress induced depression. My therapistwho i now cannot afford anymore has suggested i get sleeping pills and antidepressants ontop of my pcos pills but I am soo scared of the anti depressants I do not want to be no offence to anyone a robot which sounds horrible but I am soo scared that everything will become dull but right now is not much better. I want a hug but my mum is 250 miles away and keeps sending live laugh love quotes.I had to withdraw a application for a job today because they wanted 3 massive 8 hour tasks to be completed before they even selected you for an interview and even though the money is good on top of already having 2 jobs to eat and manage to get to work all i want to do is sleep all day. Its hard not to blame myself i feel soo fucking dumb .I am always soooo fucking tired. i wake up at like 4am just because and cannot go back to sleep ever. My flatmate has come to ask me to do more of the chores and I have now burst out into tears pathetically because I am soo tired to do all of them I also ate his food because I am always soo hungry but then full after eating 2 meals. I cannot live a normal life eat or cook or do anything other than work and watch anime just because I am soo broke and tired all the time.I have had mental issues in the past and it felt like no one believed me or did anything because i was not long term or severe enough. Its hard to even listen to my therapist saying I am depressed.so my question is how did it feel to be on antidepressants? can i go back to the way i was before? will everything feel just fine? will my doctor believe me? Also can i have a hug? I do not know what to do,Depression

7741,Hi I always wanted to talk here but never did. I have depression since age of 10 I am 18 years old. I lost a huge amount of my memory power like if I have dementia it is the most annoying shit. Because of that my brain decided to go full on stupid since 6th grade. The funny part is that i get reminded of that a lot in school for instance people know I have autism asperger and they ALWAYS expect me to be some kind of genius and then get disappointed right in front of me one big reason why I hate human beings. I also lost all the human fear of death like in 2017 i got threatened with a knife by the bully I beated the day before. He came from behind me that is what sh with a sharpened knife touching me while saying he would kill me and I said that he should do it fast then because if i got that knife I was going to pull his guts out with it.

12948,Is it normal for no one to initiate contact? No one usually checks in or says hello unless I start the conversation.Proof of my lack of worth or overthinking and loneliness? Contact,Depression
20591,So i always had depression but now i'am experiencing things that made me think if i'am a normal person.This seems ridiculous at first but it is really affecting me.It all started when i engaged in a discussion about a horror movie that was released a week ago i was really surprised that if a character is or not likable influence the way people like movies.I always see this in book or movie reviews but i never cared about it until now.Again i know that this sounds ridculous but this is making me question my sanity.This is because my entire life i never tought if a movie or book character is likable or not i just live the moment.For example in a horror movie i never root for the main characters if they are being chased by a killer or a monster i never think oh they must survive i just live the moment if they live ok and if they die that it is also ok.And i really prefer the horror movie antagonists over the heroes.it is really hard for me to understand this need to have likable characters in a book or movie there are different kinds of people we have good people we have evil people so if a character is not likable it ruins all the book or all the movie?What about the story?For example i read a book about the Slenderman where the main character was not likable but the fact that he was being terrorized by the Slenderman was enough for the book to be interesting the main character does not need to be likable for me to know that he is in danger and for the Slenderman to be scary.I really need advice i do not feel like a normalchuman anymore i'am crazy because i do not care if a character is or not likable in a story?I the only one? I think i'am going insane and i need advice.,Depression
8629,It pains me that this has happened to me. Grandpa died with me when I was 9 years old and my father got cancer and he died when I was 13 years old. I am afraid that these two events have changed my brain structure permanently and I will always be prone to depression. I quit smoking and suddenly became severely depressed I had to go to a psychiatrist right away. It just hurts me that it happened to me I would like to look at the world positively but I cannot. I am only 20 years old after my dad died my grandmother promised me that nothing bad would happen to me but she was wrong. I do not want to fight depression most of my life. I wish I had a normal life like the rest of my family no one died in their childhood. It pains me that this has happened to me. It hurts me that my life would have been better if they had not died. My childhood was good but death destroyed it. Fate sucks. It hurts me that it is all because of the death of my father and grandfather in childhood.,Depression
47895,Antidepressants... So this is maybe the wrong kind of question but has anyone here gone on Zoloft and just started feeling like doing nothing but sleep? I've been on it for probably 3 weeks now and it's becoming more of a problem. The last two days especially I've barely felt like being awake at all.I have an appointment Friday but not with my prescriber so I'll bring it up but I wondered if anyone else has had this happen and if it improves with more time or whether it might be that I need to have my medication switched.,Depression
22907,I do not think the life I have is worth fighting for. The only thing that is keeping me from ending myself is the pain factor of death.I am just waiting for the pain and agony in my life to be greater than the fear of pain of dying and I will be happy to do it.I will not bore you with my life story and please do not tell me I matter. I know you mean well and probably really mean it as well but I do not believe someone you have not even known for a minute matters. The truth is no one would care if I dropped dead tomorrow. Sure my mum and sister would be sad but they will get over it. And I am not some sad troubled soul. I am weak and pathetic beacuse I cannot even get through simple life which other people seem to be doing fine at.As I said before it is just not worth it. I am just waiting for the day the pain irl to get so bad that the pain of killing myself would not scare me that much. I am 18 and I just do not think it is worth it anymore.,Depression
9537,To begin i apologize for my english I am not a native english speaker also i cannot see a lot through my tears.Ill be 20 in about 2 weeks and as long as i can remember i always felt empty sad or angry.Mostly because i grew up in a toxic family i cannot part with because I am kind of dependant to them.So i tried seeking help last year un february then Covid happened. And i had my first meeting with a psychologist from my college. She helped me a lot i even thought that ill finally be free. That i will not feel like that anymore.Guess i was lying to myself again.I just feel like if was done like i could not fight with sadness anymore as if it won.I do not know if ill be able to stay i do not want to live anymore and its been months i do not even feel alive anymore.Just emptiness I am tired i do not know what i should do After weeks of no suicidal thoughts I am just done,Depression
16462,and keep doing that forever and ever...because A society will not allow me B the sun will explode in 4.5 billion years and C blame parents and D blame the internet in general for feeding the fantasy. All I want to do is have trillions and trillions and trillions of beautiful women and trannies around but I have to be a slave to society and do these shitty jobs that do not add value to my life other than add to the depression.Get rid of the male disease and the internet and you solve ALL problems including corruption.This bullshit capitalistic society is what adds to the problem...and always has and always will. I cannot have the world I want so why bother with even bringing anyone,Depression
38129,a little about me first i have always been the type of person to see thing only black and white i live my life through fact and being direct im very detailed and observant i observe people behavior and see who they really are are they genuine fake im also the type of person who analyzes everything could be over thinking i analyze every conversation every behavior every tone and i start to over think doe this person hate me did i say the wrong thing i dont think i can change the way i am by not caring because i had a lot of pressure of being perfect or good enough growing up i define myself a a perfectionist and a people pleaser i hate who i am and i push so many people away in my life because i dont feel like anyone actually care about me i feel alone and im sad i started a program at school that is very competitive to get in i wa hoping to make friend there since we all worked so hard to get in it been about a year and i dont see any of them outside of school no one text me outside of school and during school no one talk about anything other than school it like no one actually care what i did over the weekend or how my life is i would put myself out there and be interested in others life and even invite them to do stuff but i always get turned down every time i get turned down it just another step deeper into depression i just hate the person i am and i feel like i dont belong in anyones life,Depression
10449,The friends I do have are no help and everything I have tried cannot distract me. And I have spent all day in bed. I am just sad and no one I talk to has made me feel any better. And I fucking hate this feeling so much. Nothing I do distracts me and I have no friends lol,Depression
37743,pretty much everyone in my family ha depression or bipolar and i m no exception i m just so worried that it ll make thing worse i m definitely moderate functioning i can go to work and kinda be an ok parent i m not going to off myself even though i have the ideation sometimes but i know life could be much better i might be able to actually do the thing i enjoy in my free time again maybe i won t have the constant brain fog and forgetfulness but what if i end up just feeling numb what if medication make it worse what if i go to a doctor and they won t help i ve never been to a legitimately helpful doctor looking up review doesn t help real talk did medication actually help or make it worse how did it work out for you,Depression
11954,Right now I am in lockdown at Sydney and lately I have been feeling really rough all my hobbies are being pulled from under me end am house bound like the rest of us my girlfriend is terrified of the virus and we agreed to not see each other until lockdown ends since we live in different areas and do not have any to risk anything. The last week she went a little quiet and I asked if everything is ok and she is come out saying she is second guessing being in a relationship as she likes her freedom of being on her own but she loves spending time together but her introvert personality does not know. I reassure her that I am happy to go at whatever pace she wants she just has to be honest and she brings up that she was never looking for a relationship on the app and did not expect to meet someone she likes this much. I never told her I have feelings for her just that I really like her and care about her and she said because she is confused she feels so shit since we have feelings each other but the prospect of being in a relationship makes her uncomfortable right now. She asked for my advice and I said look right now if we end it it will not make sense you just said you have feelings for me how about we continue to see each other after lockdown and of something happens it does. She agreed and stated she wants to try instead of just giving up. She lives on her own so I am thinking the anxiety and loneliness might be getting to her and she is a little in her own head? Even though we have been dating for 5 months I really like her. I have had a rough 3 years dealing with family loss getting made redundant from one job my business I started before Covid doing well then failing due to the pandemic dealing with toxic relatives over an inheritance. Meeting her felt like it all started turning around and I started to feel happy for the first time in ages.Right now I am feeling so alone confused and lost and I feel I do not have anyone to talk to about it Feeling so alone right now.,Depression
7689,I have been walking around being productive I have a boyfriend I have emancipation papers not filled out I have this big plan on how I am going to go out and live life and pursue college. I have told all my friends that I am going to leave my family which I feel like is emotionally and mentally abusive but I am not sure and go get an apartment and finish highschool and go straight to college and then Med school. Problem is I have not actually done any of that. This past year I got pulled out of school twice for suicide watch my grades plummeted I quit my sports team and I cut off most of my friends I stopped showing up to work and I just tried to not to kill myself. Recently its been getting worse at home. My father has become more controlling grounding me for stupid things taking away my car not letting me see my boyfriend or friends gaslighting me for not spending time with him etc. My mother has gotten better she has not manipulated me in a while so I think were fine. Her husband on the other hand says that I am the reason my mothers health has deteriorated both of my stepparents have said that I am the reason our family is dysfunctional. Sometimes I like to think I am stronger than others that I have it worse than my friends but that is not true at all. I am weaker than all of them. My life is so easy. So why should I want to stop existing? there is been awful shit that is happened when I was a kid Ill admit but as of late lifes not as bad as it could be. Idk I just feel so stupid. Living the vida depressy,Depression

15180,The only thing keeping me here is the guilt of how much Id hurt my family if I killed myself. Its so painful to be alive. I hate my life but my parents would not be able to move on if I killed my self. Without them there is no reason for me to stay here. I just want to know what to say to have them forgive me and move on with their lives after I am gone. I am searching for a reason to stay other than guilt. I have put them through so much. I am only alive for other people,Depression
14738,This has happened more than once three time in the last year every time i meet a girl I really like they always leave me. No matter how I talk to them. I feel like its the only thing that will make me happy is having a girlfriend that I can eventually love hang out with. I have a lonely life where I live I have no family here. Its depressing and I feel down and my self esteem is shot. I feel really silly posting this but idk where else to vent,Depression
24997,In the summer of 2019 I was going into my sophomore year of college with a 3.5 gpa and hoping to go to medical school. At the very end of summer something changed I just stopped giving a fuck about anything. I lived with my best friends and ostracized myself because I would sleep for most of the day. I did terrible in a lot of classes because I just slept through them. I went back to my home state for covid. In 2020 I started at a new school online and absolutely failed just because I did not give a shit enough to try in my classes. To add upon that I probably did not even leave my house for months at a time and when I did it was to go to the liquor store to buy a liter of vodka. I completley failed that year. Probably did not get a grade above a C. How did this happen I used to be so intelligent and I would study dutifully for every single quiz and test now i just sleep through classes. What the fuck happened to me Why the fuck did i become depressed,Depression
12695,Hey guys I am not in such a bad spot right now that I need anything immediate. But I need therapy. I absolutely cannot afford it right now. What are some holdmeovers until I can get health insurance through my work? I have got to go I think 36 months before I am eligible. I purchased a journal yesterday to try and help write myself out on paper. I also am deciding to go completely sober. I am even going to try to drop caffeine. I stopped nicotine about 6 months ago. And have been successful with it. I cut down my caffeine intake but it is still regular. As for alcohol I have cut way back. But I still have a binge every so often with friends. I smoke green regularly and intend to stop that too. What are other ideas to keep me around until I can get some professional help? I need help,Depression

15502,Hi everyone I used to have depression but not any more since I have met my girlfriend but my girlfriend still have depression. she will have days where she laid down on bed all day and will not tell me what is wrong. I am in a situation with my physical health and I told her I need her to be strong for me and she said she will but because of her depression and anxiety she tends to stress easily and goes into depression. Should I face the fact that she cannot be strong for me and give up? I have been trying to help her with all of my heart but it seems like it is all going to waste. What should I do? Depressed Girlfriend,Depression

14942,I have been feeling depressed since the pandemic started. Back then I was at least productive and now I just feel what is the point. I have been living in a good city basically my whole life. I never once had a night out or did anything because I wanted to be a good kid. Once I did my boards I thought I could finally let go and chill for a bit and finally live a little but the pandemic shitted all my plans. I was planning to take a gap year after I graduated to finally enjoy my life a bit but I recently found out my dad is getting transferred to some village and we have to move. I just feel like I have wasted my life trying to fit in the mold of a good kid. I have been here all my life and making friends does not come easy I just fear I will be lonely all my life. I used to have morning walks that gave me some relief but I cannot do that because of rain. I feel very suffocated. I am also under a lot of pressure because my dad thinks I will get into one of the top law colleges. Please offer me some advice and do not suggest therapy or treatment because it is a huge stigma here. I need some guidance please. I need guidance and help,Depression
47525,I want my old self back I have had countless changes in my life and came in terms with at some point....but I myself changed a lot. Not in a good way. That's what I'll never recover from.I wasn't the best with emotions of people that time but atleast I was happy and functional. I have tied my worth to a lot of things which I no longer have. That made me question worth relentlessly. I think everyone deserves to be happy despite everything in life but I can't say it to myself. All conditions are different for myself. I deserve to starve if I don't do well I deserve to not meet anyone if I messed up somewhere I deserve to be treated like shit. It took me a while to realise how I came to accept being treated badly by people. I am working on myself but will I ever be able to get my old self back? No. I'm stuck with a version of myself who cares about everything except herself and it fucking sucks.,Depression

16074,I feel like I have tried every medication over the years. I was on Zoloft for a literal decade and have only just weaned off it and went onto Wellbutrin. I am also on Lamictal to stabilize my moods. However the Wellbutrin while it gives me energy is making me extremely short tempered and aggravated. I am going to talk to my psychiatrist in a couple days about adjusting my meds and might ask about a low dose of Zoloft along with the Wellbutrin but I just really do not want to be on three different mood meds at the same time. Has anyone been in this situation suggestions? Medication questions,Depression

I just catch myself doing it without even thinking about it and now I am just sitting here questioning my sanity because I feel like a brainless doped up kid that cannot control himself.

12806,what if i tried so much to pull myself back but i failed everytime i have developed anxiety over years and it is not going away and my depression does not have a switch and i could bring myself to something for myself everytime i try to do something i ask myself what is the point of this? i always considered killing myself but never had the courage to do it i do not have anyone near me because in the early stages of my depression i pushed everyone away my parents are telling me to move out i still have no idea about outer world but i could not even smile never felt genuinely happy for anything i just want to die a painless death everything i question everything while typing this I am wondering if I am trauma dumping or self victimising i do not even like to open up i do not want to get better i want to die what if i never overcome this?,Depression
19720,Crosspost I do not know where to start. This is going to be very long and I do not expect anyone to read it.ampx200Bwhat is been weighing heavy on my mind since I woke up this morning is AM. Those are his actual initials and that is really all he is to me. And bad memories. I have nightmares regularly with him in them. I cannot help but want to ask him if he is sorry 23 years later. I could not believe my eyes the day I found cp on his second phone. You may ask yourself second phone? then glance up at the red flag. Yeah I have a hard time not blaming myself for falling in love with someone I can clearly see was a terrible person in hindsight. But I did.I told myself for over a year afterward that I would never be capable of loving someone so endlessly and freely. Part of me still believes that. Part of me knows that is the grooming and abuse still doing its job. However none of me genuinely feels bad for myself. I wanted to die before I met him and I want to die now. I wanted to die when I was with him too. A rapper I like said it best I still want to die but got someone to do it with.I think what makes it so difficult is that we were junkies in love. Spending all my money on drugs of choice. Being in love on drugs cannot compare to doing it sober. I still cannot figure out if he knew what he was doing or if he was just so fucked up that he cannot see what he did.For the sake of TLDR I think the one story I will share is the day he was trying to convince me to give him back his second phone. For context this was directly prior to the purge on Tumblr. Before the purge in general.I had found cp one time prior around Christmastime living in a motel but I was so deeply disgusted and disturbed and also literally was not trying to invade his privacy that he easily convinced me it would never happen again and it was a onetime thing that he felt extremely guilty for. I have to excuse myself here and say I was extremely drugged up and not thinking clearly.The next time I found it was after we moved into an apartment and signed a lease. I was looking through his phone and found way more evidence than would have been needed to convict him. I told him and took his phone and almost always kept it on my person. He played nice for a couple days trying to get me not to go to the police. Which worked. What also worked was the day he blew up. He told me he felt like I was keeping the phone instead of getting rid of it to spite him. I told him I was not sure what I wanted to do yet. He practically begged me to give it back to him. So I took it and threw it into the dumpster in our apartment complex. I told him if he wanted it he could climb in there and go get it. I am not sure if he did. I would not put it behind him.ampx200BThe other thing weighing heavy on my mind is SW. Also his actual initials. Also only bad memories. Sometimes I have nightmares about him too. This one is hard because I blame myself entirely for it even though I advocate that teenagerschildren are not at fault if an adult takes advantage of them even if they initiate it or think they want it. The age difference was about 1012 years but the exact number escapes me. I was a minor at the time.I think he was the first one who ever told me to call him daddy. I do not have any words in my head when I think about what happened it is really only flashes of what I can remember and what I felt. I feel disgusted by my former self for allowing SW into my home and letting him do those things to me. I remember the smell of cheap beer and menthol cigarettes on his breath. I remember the process of letting him get away even though my mother contacted the police. I remember his girlfriend messaging me on facebook some time later asking what SW said was wrong with her. That is so sad.ampx200BWhat it boils down to is this after SW I attempted suicide. I would have succeeded if what I hung myself from did not break. After AM I never properly attempted but today I am surprised that my recklessness and inconsideration for my own life did not kill me.Today I weigh a lot on how easy it would have been to commit suicide after AM. No one cared about me I did not talk to family or friends and I had nothing at all going for me in my life.Today it is only hard to do it because of my responsibilities and shame. there is not much more to say here. Of course there is also the fact that my boyfriend and family would have to cope with it but some of that ties into responsibilities instead of actual guilt. It would be easier if I was high and I just want to say fuck it and go buy drugs. But I do not know what my boyfriend would do. Part of me literally does not care because he kind of treats me like shit too.I literally do not want to put in the effort of getting better. I do not want to have to find a counselortherapistpsychiatrist. I do not want to have to try different medications when being high is so much better than being happy. I do not want to talk about what happened to me because there is nothing I can do to make it not happen and because I cannot fucking kill the people who hurt me the most. As far as I know too they are fine. they are fucking fine. And I am still struggling to be a person. I just wish there was a switch that could make it better or just never happen in the first place so I did not have to put in the effort to get better for things that weren't my fault. I should have killed myself after AM then I would not have to hurt my best friendboyfriend and my family I have gotten closer to since I got sober. I wish I never got sober. I wish I let him kill me. I should have killed myself when it would have been easy,Depression
8603,Hello everyoneI am considering starting psychotherapy again. I have received psychodynamic psychotherapy for about 3.5 years but it helped up to a point as its main goal is to make the client realize and be conscious of mental patterns and act on them. I am looking for new ways to heal myself. Basically even if there is nothing going on I feel constant anguish distress anxiety and existential pain. I see no meaning of life at all but this is not due to my psychology but my philosophical approach to life. I am an existentialist in a way. Plus to me there is no meaning of suffering in life as other toxic positive people claim that suffering makes us strong bla bla. Why would I suffer? I want to have fun in life which also leads to laziness for me sometimes. However my feelings are generally negative. How can I overcome my anguish anxiety and distress? Is there helpful approach of psychotherapy for me? I am also in an alert state all the time that other people might harmhurt me due to survival instincts for instance in business or for money. This also causes my anxiety. ampx200BI appreciate any thought idea and help. Thank you How can I overcome my feelings of anguish distress anxiety and existential pain?,Depression
27325,I feel like I am just existing but for what. I have been depressed for a while now but recently my girlfriend of 9 years has broken up with me and things are now so much worse. I have social anxiety and just feel like I will never meet someone again. I feel abandoned and upset. I have dark thoughts quite often and question the reasons to even stay alive. The only reason I am still here is because of my family. My mum in particular has said in the past she would never forgive me for doing such a selfish act. I love my family to bits and I would hate to put them through it. So I am simply here in body but not in mind what a sad life Existing,Depression

18362,i could do so much during the day if i did not have to sleep. i always try my best to stay up as long as i can until i pass out because the act of falling asleep is miserable. i want to always keep my mind occupied. and even when i am tired i still cannot fall asleep so why even try. do not get me wrong. i love sleeping. the unconsciousness. but then comes waking up. and having to do the day over. and then not achieving anything. i just go go go until i crash. idk if anyone else does this or gets what i mean but ya. i just feel empty.

16103,Had a really long really bad depressive episode last year I have been doing ok since about late November but man has it come back with a vengeance these last two months. At the moment all I can think about is SH and killing myself. My therapist wants me to be hospitalised but I cannot bare anyone but her knowing how bad I am doing. I refused and she made me promise her Id see her on Friday and I just wish I had not made that promise the way she looked at me when i promised is burned into my fkn soul. I really do not see any point in continuing this pattern. Depression back with a vengance,Depression

I only realise how bad I am doing when I am having a good phase.,Depression
15129,Does anyone else have a Non Epileptic Attack Disorder NEAD ? it is quite rare but this is a large community of possible contenders for it. Basically it is a dissociation tactic the brain sometimes employs causing fainting and even what may appear to be a seizure. In my case I faint and go so rigid I shake and jerk from the tension. While my eyes flicker as I try and work back through the fog to my body and who ever is shaking and making far way sounds at me. If roused by rigorous tapping and shaking it can last 2 minutes if left alone it can go on for up to 10 and then I truly pass out into a near coma like sleep for hours. Including face down in a puddle in the smoking yard at work! Luckily only a touch of hypothermia was the result. The other danger is since you make no attempt to break your fall when you pass out hitting your head can be a problem. Fortunately I have only had bruises and cuts without any major concussion or injuries.It is not however caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain like real epilepsy so it is not respondent too medication. It is essentially a psychosomatic problem that requires CBT in order to retrain the brain to stop pulling the collapsing stunt everytime you feel like you need to dissociate. It took 14 weeks of intensive cbt therapy at the only hospital in the UK to have a unit for such conditions. The historic Bethlem Royal Hospital once the infamous Bedlam I was able to bring the seizures down from 5 or 6 a week to 1 or 2 and the recovery time form 8 hours to 1. Which is a big improvement but it still makes getting back into work difficult. I had to stop working before when the seizures were regularly meaning I was forced to miss and cut short work shifts. Now that is it is less frequent I still fear I go back into work the same thing will happen and I will let everyone down again forcing them to scramble to cover me. Also I do not know hot to tell a employer 'yeah sometimes I might just collapse and have to go home.' I had depression before this but the absolute hold its put on my life is really piling on the depression. I am still amazed I was able to find a partner who wants a long term relationship with someone with nothing going for them at all but I got lucky and it is the only good thing I have. I am 28 and we are forced to live with my parents while he works to earn money for our own places. Covid set that back by putting him out of work for a long time to we bad to eat through what he had saved. I am just sick of this and sick of holding him back. There feels extra pressure that I am a guy out of work too. Like I should be making my own money. Not claiming some disability payments for a dumb condition most neuroscientists have not even heard of. NEAD conditions and dissociation,Depression
48298,Selfishness I don't feel very good it's like I don't belong in this world I don't think I ever did. My friends are happy and I'm always the one who's not really funny and who ruins the mood. So now I try to say as little as possible people always ask me if I'm okay if I'm tired or worse they say I'm scary. I think I'm just a mistake. People must find me weird or creepy it's ruining me. A few years ago my brother committed suicide I felt very close to him I think about his death all the time I wish I could start my life over again and make the right choices for once. What affects me the most is girls I think... It's ridiculous but I would love to have a relationship with a very pretty girl. Sometimes I think I've suffered so much that I would at least deserve that. I saw the damage my brother's death caused in my family now I think if I didn't have a family to make suffer gt suicide. My message is so selfish and I know it. Thank you for reading these few lines... Lust,Depression
6976,I am going to make this short because i hate thinking about it but long story short I am getting better after months of medication therapy etc. My anxiety is at an alltime low and my antidepressants do not allow my mind to wander too much into suicidal thoughts. But i hate it i hate that I am getting better i feel embarrassed whenever i catch myself doing something not depressing like taking a walk laughing or doing stuff by my own will. And i feel SO SO selfish i was given immense support from everyone my mum has spent so so much time and money on therapists psychiatrists pills etc she is suffered more than anyone else even more than me since i seem to enjoy being depressed. she is the happiest she is been in months since she can tell I am in a better mood and she is the only reason i have not tried harder to get worse but i do not know how long i can keep it going.Something in me just wants me to maybe stop taking my meds without letting her know get a new self destructive habit and go back to the old me that did not leave his bed in days and could not keep a conversation for more than 2 minutes i really miss it.I am going back to school in a couple of months i dropped out i started driving lessons yesterday I am eating better sleeping better I am starting to live and behave like a regular person but i cannot handle it it makes me feel bad gross EMBARRASSED very embarrassed and its just a cycle ofI am ok this makes me depressed I am ok again this makes me depressed etc.I do not know what to do I am not even sure why i am even writing this since I will probably end up ignoring whatever help or advice i get but i guess i needed to vent thanks for reading and as always sorry for my english how can i be happy about getting better??,Depression

12446,I have been severly depressed and suicidal for 2 months straight and today for just an hour or so I was watching some guy play this incredible piece on the piano and in the middle of watching it I realised I did not feel like dying. That I actually was experiencing joy and for a couple of seconds there I was not numb like for a couple of seconds I felt something.... feel what it was like to be a normal human again how I missed this! I cannot even begin to explain. Hope in the depths of despair,Depression
20468,My brother has been struggling with suicidal thoughts since March of this year. Before confiding in me he had been seeing a therapist and had not gotten any better. He was struggling to sleep at night so I slept with him every night for two months. I let him vent to me he cried in my arms and Id wait for him to fall asleep before I did. Unfortunately I had to put my life on pause for all of this so that I can help him out as much as I can. After multiple failed suicide attempts I decided to Baker Act him for three days until I found a facility that could house and treat him. While hospitalized he was put on antidepressants and has continued taking them since then. After he was released from the hospital I had him stay in a treatment facility for about a month. He stopped sleeping there but he continued to go the facility every weekday for about six to eight hours. After receiving treatment from this place for a few months he says he has not gotten any better. Since the start of all this he has become so heartless and cold towards me. He told me the only reason hes alive is because killing yourself is very difficult and hes failed every time. I begged him to promise me he will not try again and he says he cannot make that promise. I love him more than I can put into words and every time I tell him that he does not say it back. I feel like I have tried everything I can. I am desperate. I do not know what to do. Apart of me feels like its time I take a step back because maybe I am being overbearing and I need to let him figure this out on his own. This has taken so much of a toll on me that I have had to seek therapy as well. I do not know what more I can do to help him. My 19 year old brother is suicidal and I am desperate to help him.,Depression
12749,Growing up no one bothered remembering my name not even teachers. I missed out on a lot in high school because I was never on any of the lists despite me telling them days before. I do not understand what makes me so forgettable. So unnoticed despite my efforts to talk to people. As I got older coworkers did not know I even worked there despite us starting at the same time. Managers would forget I was there. I have stopped trying to be noticed at this point. Why am I so invisible? Rant,Depression
24746,I have just began watching Boku no hero academia I expected the level of sadness but something added. I was reminded of my life my life is nothing but pain. Watching everybody there made me feel sad because everybody is out there improving themselvesachieving their dreams having mentors having adventures and they feel pain but it is much more healthier than mine. Once the tv screen fades to black I felt empty and sad my depression began to show it is mean self again. All I could repeat to myself is my life is boring their not real bakugou's not real I am a coward. This all repeats in my head as my chest felt heavy shit. I wish I could be in their world a lot of destructions but I will be more free there instead of being in the same house for many years not even allowed to go faraway. I feel like my reality will always be like this...empty sad boring and filled with suffering. I do not even remember what it feels like to be happy about something. I want to go on and fight but what am I supposed to do with this feelings? All I ever receive was negativity and this quarantine is making it fucking worst. Everytime a movie or music ends I stare around my room and feel nothing but immense sadness and emptiness. it is so sad I want to have an exciting life but it is so hard. I am sad over the fact that I am not in bnha,Depression

The school system destroyed me but I did my best to persevere and try to go the furthest I could.But now that Im considered as an adult in this world I just feel too different to achieve anythingand my opinions political or philosophical are just making me so sure about the fact that getting the life that everybody already has having a work getting paid consuming for your pleasure your needsbeing officially included in this consumer society as a consumer won't fix anything.I couldnt even enjoy my childhood same with my teenage years.How am I supposed to have the strength to at least have hope for adulthood?

7202,Hey been awhile since i posted and i would not say I am much better since last time. I just wonder why i feel alone all the time. sure I have got a small group of guys that are great friends but it does not seem like they actually care about me at all. Its not an obligation to check up on me i know but it just seems like I am always the one checking up on others when here i am feeling alone depressed i share things with them which i feel would make them happy but no one really does the same no one really listens you know. Is it in human nature to be selfish? why does everyone i know only put themselves before others including me all the time because it sure feels that way. I am not tryna say I am the most selfless guy out there but i do my best.. all I am trying to say is i just want someone to care to listen i just want to feel appreciated and that i mean something to someone. I am sorry if i meant anything in a rude way i hope you understand. Thanks for reading and have a good day. Friends,Depression

Having achieved some of my life long goals at 24 years young. Yet the time I get to myself I just sit and heavly critique everything I have done and end up in badddd spot. Idk. Its exhausting. I hope at some point I am happy and content with my lifes work. Its hard to enjoy anything I have accomplished. By time I am approaching hitting one goal my brains already like what is next Almost like a sickness in me. I literally joke with my biz partner that I am just not well.

Fuck my grandparents for not letting me use drugs. Fuck regular jobs. Fuck covid. Fuck Dora the explorer. Fuck everything. Fuck my inability to find what I love and the drive to pursue it. Fuck my mum for being a drug addict and getting deported when I was 2. Fuck my dad for not letting me live with him because he cannot handle his marriage. Fuck my first ex for not taking me back. Fuck the government for not making all drugs free. Fuck my brain for not being happy. Fuck all the cunts who dipped on me. Fuck all the boring basic cunts out there. Fuck people who cannot think you can achieve great things. Fuckkk,Depression
18122,Work makes me feel like I am a slave trapped inside of a box. I have to put myself and soul into a prison cell for 8 hours while I apathetically get through the shift. How is this not suicidal? What part about that is fun? Its modern day feudalism at its finest. Jobs do not promote any individual growth. They just want you to willing to work 190 hours a week and do not give a fuck about mental health. They care zero. Instead you will be ostracized and scrutinized because you do not engage in the toxic one up culture every job has. It enslaves me and makes me feel uncomprehendingly trapped. There is a whole world out there and inside of me but I have to stand at this shithole for 8 hours? Id rather be dead. Who would not? Are you kidding me? The dread is unmatched. The dread is terrorizing and most people do not understand. They just tell me that is life. Some life we live. that is just such a joke to me. I have not even mentioned the miserable system. Its not just my job I hate. I do hate it but its working in general. The whole concept. People call me lazy but that is because they are brainwashed into believing selling your soul is the best way to live. Minimum wage jobs are so toxic. The management has zero regard for humanity the employee morale is pathetically low i do not give a fuck about the customers and they do not give a fuck about me. No one wants to be there. Then you have to obtain experience to get a less shitty job and that whole process is miserable to. I wish I lived in a European or different culture where mental health and family relationships are more a priority then punching in hours on the clock. Sorry little brother I cannot be there to support you for your game this Friday because I have to work and Ill be starving otherwise. Its so backwards. Fuck work Work makes me want to kill myself and no one understands,Depression
14954,I love music. I like to dance to edm and rock music to help me deal with life. Its always about an hour or two of this rocks! Why was I ever sad?! and then all of a sudden it just hits me. I start to spiral and worry about everything that I should be doing but cannot. I give in turn off the music and lay back down. I hate it. I just want one thing besides sleep that brings me peace. Everywhere I go I have tried the hiking going for walks sitting in a park etc. but I hate that too. I live in a very small rural town. So going out is not really that fun not like a bigger city where you can just walk around all day and explore. Even when I do something fun after about an hour I want to stop because I am too hopeless to continue.,Depression
22829,I have extreme anxiety to the point where getting up in the morning is difficult and going outside makes my heart feel as if it is going to escape my chest. I have been depressed for probably all my life starting sometime in elementary school and as a result I lived a very isolated life. I will never be a proper functioning adult in this world,Depression
24864,I have been dealing with depression for a very long time. I think that the worst part about going through depressive states is when you finally feel happy you go in with your life and then depression hits again. When I am out I when I am having fun and then everything crumbles. Like a switch in my mind everything is dark nothing feels right there is a discomfort to exist and it just gets hard for me at least to wake up and do my daily life then the feeling of guilt attacks me because I have not done anything with my life.I hate this I hate feeling stuck. I hate feeling selfish. I hate not being able to be happy and there for my loved ones. I hate existing like this its an exhausting feeling of none stop cycles of up and down. Feeling very depressed,Depression
20397,I have not told any family or about this they have enough to deal with as it is and I do not want to be selfish by bringing my problems to them. I have a couple of friends but I think they would be able to get over it. I worry most for my brother I am the only person he talks to and if I am gone then I cannot be there for him. Plus they may think I am crazy and send my to a psychiatrist and I do not want to do that. If I could stop my existence without hurting anyone I love I would in the blink of an eye. At the same time it is really selfish of me to want this after all life is not about me it is about helping my family and others. I want to become a doctor when I am older but my mind keeps chanting the mantra that I am not going to make it to adulthood and I kind of want that to be true. it is not that I hate my life it is that I hate myself. Please do not ask me to talk to a psychiatrist or my family about it I am not going to I will hide my whatever this is from them for as long as I have to and do not give me any of that It will get better nonsense because it will not you and I both know it is a lie. I just want ways to figure out what to do with myself and whether it is worth hurting my family to end my own suffering. I want to just stop existing or disassociate with humanity? I do not want to be existing like I want to go poof and be done with it but not die. I do not want to suicide because it would go against my beliefs and hurt my family but living is pain for me.,Depression

7711,I have been postinf here lately. Idk I think I am just trying to release some pressure. I think I am starting to enjoy getting ghosted. I grew up with zero friends no friends at all. I felt sad about it for several years... but I feel like this no more. Getting hookups on tinder making temporary friends casual chat with other Xbox players and never talking with them again. I think I stopped GAFOS. Yes it is good to exchange some messages and stuff but I just do not care about other people's feelings anymore. I became a cynical person. My depression got worse over time and now I am do not care about what I say what I do. Not trying to be edgy trust me. But I think I got to a point where I am dead inside and I do not care if people see it anymore. I have two friends I met both of them here. Good people I hope we can still talk love ya but I simply do not care about others. I feel no empathy no remorse nothing. I know I should seek help and blah blah blah. But the world is just... I fought for my life many years. Tried to seek help went to therapy that kind of stuff. But I just cannot see any hope. I go outside and I feel sick. People is just so selfish ignorant and not a single one of them gives a fuck about others.I worked as a paramedic for a couple of years donated to charities tried to be a good person. But the world took me down. I do not know I think this might be it. This is my life from now on. Not feeling anything. Enjoying my loneliness and feeling empty at the same time. This is it.

I have went to a doctor and got a prescription for some depression anxiety meds it does not seem to be working at all cannot sleep or eat,Depression
16489,God I am a wreck at the moment. My mind is just racing. My bf is away this weekend with friends and was texting and checking how I was. I said I was not good but not to worry and sorry for being a burden. He said I am not a burden and he can come home early if I needed. I just burst out crying!! Anyone else very emotional at the moment? Just had a bit of a cry earlier!,Depression
39415,can t stop thinking i m dying of something anything all the time petrified a usual but i m also too scared to go to the doctor and the whole shebang anyway so here i am stewing in my own juice of despair agonising over all the what ifs while doing absolutely nothing about it don t you just love it ironically i feel like even if i did manage to get myself to talk to a doctor get an mri and blood work and all that dramatic stuff i still wouldn t believe them i feel so trapped,Depression
11587,I work in an urgent care and I got reprimanded. The first one was when I found a woman bleeding on the ground right outside the clinic and I went inside to get help because I could not lift her by myself. I told the PA and everyone pretty much rushed outside except me and one other person because I just got there and had to put my stuff down. But they think I completely ignored the patient and walked by them when I was the one who found her and got help. The reason I did not go with them was because someone had to keep seeing the patients. They were backed up already and there were 5 people already going outside to help her that it would have made no sense for me to go with them. They did not even try to clear things up with me. They just assumed that I did not want to help and told my supervisor which is bullshit. They think I am horrible because of a misunderstanding. And then I messed up by not putting the patient in the bed when putting an IV in. They fainted and started convulsing which could have hurt them badly if they hit their head. I know I screwed up big time and I just cannot get over it. I was going to go part time once school started in fall. But now I think I should just quit. Maybe I just do not belong in health care and its a mistake going to nursing school. that is all I know how to do and I cannot even do things right. Just kill me now before I hurt anyone else My job thinks I am horrible,Depression
38152,i m at that point it s just too much there s no way to even describe it anymore,Depression
16004,Hi there I have had a couple of episodes of depression over the last few years but I understand that everyone is experience is different. A few years ago I made friends with someone who also suffered with depression but more severely. I did as much as I could to help but unfortunately they did something to hurt me not intentionally but it hit me pretty hard. Anyway we carried on for a bit longer until one day we had an argument. Then I felt like things had changed they stopped communicating became quite avoidant. I did manage to arrange a talk with them all I got from them was that they had gone in to protective mode they had their guard up and they did not want to hurt me because that would hurt them. I did ask them if they still wanted me in their life and they said obviously yes. However things did not really improve after a month I could see that they were getting closer to a mutual friend almost like they were replacing me with them. I tried to speak to them again but they just shut me down they were in a bad place at the time. They did apologise but then the next day they blocked me. I just want to see if anyone relates to any of those feelings because pushing people away is not something that I did when I was depressed so I want to understand a bit more of where they are coming from. I do not want to take it personally but I do find it quite hard sometimes. Pushed away,Depression
15839,Never thought Id say this but my 2 week holidays started and I already miss work since I have nothing going on in my life to be happy about..The weekend I just laid in my bed and watched YouTube videos and I feel like the next 2 weeks are going to be the same I do not like going out and enjoy being home with no irl friends but 2 weeks of that daily is horrible to my mental health What do you guys do on your holidays? What would you recommend me Work holiday and do not know what to do,Depression

14889,Out of all the possible realities we could have been born into we were born into a reality where selfishness violence greed and murder are embedded into surviving in life. The rules are that we have to kill and dismantle other living creatures and consume their molecules to stay alive. does not matter if you are doing the killing or someone else is. It has to be done. This is not about an antimeat or proveganism stance. it is just the hard realization for how things actually are here that cruelty and selfishness is deeply rooted in nature and there is no escaping that.it is amazing that we started out with just water air and sunlight. I often wonder how different life would be if eating was an optional luxury or to prevent social inequalities if eating was poisonous.What point is there to life when most of one's life is spent wanting to exist in alternative worlds?Of course we cannot control how nature works and has decided to be. To stop eating meat and plants would consistently result in a slow and painful death. We do not have any other options here. The cruel reality of Nature itself is depressing,Depression

10284,I have not gotten better instead I have just accepted my fate. I know I am not meant to live long so living knowing I am steadily approaching my end is bringing me peace of mind. Accepting the fact death might not even be that scary and nothing really matters is kind of comforting tbh. Everyone thinks I have moved on when in reality I have just gotten tired of fighting it,Depression
18467,anyone around? cannot do it anymore 2am and I am drowning,Depression
16986,When I think about my life all I can ever think about is lack. I feel hopeless and have been fighting these feelings for seemingly my whole life. I have been disappointed by everyone. My family has never acted like what if imagine a family is supposed to act I have always felt distant to them. I have never been able to maintain quality friendships irl nobody is interested in me. Everyone woman I have been interested in an pursued ended with failure. I have gone from job to job hating everything about it. Right now I have got a secure job that I am decent at and while it does not pay a lot it pays enough for me to survive. But I hate it just like I hate everything else about my life. I lay awake late at night while I should be sleeping and I feel hopeless. Like my life will never get better that I will always be gazing longingly in through a window from the outside and on the inside is the life I want to be living. But it is outside of my control and that pains me tremendously. I cannot make other people like me. I cannot make myself suddenly make more money. I cannot make myself like my job. I cannot make myself have more energy so that I can do more outside of work. I have been desperately trying to convince myself that it is not hopeless for years now but I still am so unsatisfied. It feels like nothing has changed in years. Nothing has happened. And I feel so hopeless I do not want to feel this way anymore. I want my life to feel like an adventure but instead every seems like a chore. Why? I cannot get over this feeling of hopelessness,Depression
26866,hey peopleI really need to talk to someone about this because i really do not know myself anymore. Am i in deppresion?ampx200BHere is the thing i have been feeling like this for a few months now. i am an hisghschool student and this is my last year so i will be heading to university next year. And i am the ambitious type so I have been and will keep working real hard for getting accepted to a good university and it will consume a lot of my time but the truth is if i do not have anything to i start thinking and it is not really fun for me because when i think i just feel alone. I feel really alone. I have some frinds. You can even say i have a lot of friends. I have really close friend too that listen to me when i am sad of talking about a problem. The thing is tho it just does not work. I have not really talked to this in lenght to anyone but when i kind of open the coversation i just feel that they just will not understand and stop talking. Change the topic. I feel that they just will not understand. They cannot. they are out there living their life having fun flirting or meeting new people and i feel like I am just the figurant in these stories. I do not feel like the protagonist of my own life anymore. I just feel like a figurant when i am with people and i just feel awfully alone when i am by myself. I used to like being to myself and listening to music. It just bores me anymore. I get bored when i am with people too. It just feels like everyone is living their lives to the fullest and i am watching on the sidelines. I feel alone. Really alone.I used to have a lover a few months back but i broke up with her. Not because something she did. I just could not see her that often anymore and i did not really love her anymore as well.She was my first and i was hers but after we did it for the first time she told me that she did'nt want to do it for some time. That really hurt me. I know because she is a women she has a larger say in this but that was very hurtful and our relationship was not the same after that night. I broke up with her around one months later. I never regretted my decision to breakup with her but i have been feeling really alone since then. I do not really have suicidal thoughts of anything. I mean to be honest i sometimes think bout suicide but i do it just briefly and i do not take it seriously. it has been kind of happening on an increasing rate laltey though. still i do not do it that often i do not think that is problem for now.I like alcohol. not too much i am not an alcoholic. But i like how when i am drunk my problems disappear. Its like i levae my problems for the future me. The problem is I have not been enjoying alcohol lately as well. When i drink i just get sad and listen to music in some corner now. isolate myself. i drink kind of alot lately as well. Not everyday of anthing but it has been increasing.I feel like i am not an important person for anyone except my family and they know only the side i show them and i know only the side they show me. I do not think people are genuine when they talk to me about their general feelings. I just do not trust people truly. I just think that they are screenig a play a facade. You might say that i feel alone jst because i do not have a love interest but it is not like that. I am not a playboy or anything so i did not have a lover for most of my life. The relation i talked about was the longest it was two months. The problem is tho i never really felt this way this alone. I really did not feel like this before and it really discomfots me.When i do not have a task that i have to to i just do not want to do anyrhing anymore. i do not want to sleep but i do not want stay awake too because i know the day doesnt have anyrhing more to give me. I know my problem is as serious as most people that are truly in clinical depression but i need to know. what do i do how do i get on with my lonely life. I have hobbies i play the guitar i really like history and videogames. Watchin moves too but i have not been enjoying them as much lately. I just do not feel like i have the time for 2 hour movies I do not enjoy videogames anymore and they just bore me after 1 hour. I used to play the guitar for hours before once I have started noe i just play 12 songs and quit. what is this feeling i feel like i cannot breath freely like there is a weight above me.I thought it was stress but now i am in summer holiday and nothing has changed. There was not that serious of a school because of covid anyways. is it loneliness? I presumed it was at first and I still think that some part of it is loneliness. but i am afraid that it goes deeper. ampx200BWht do i do now? am i in depression?,Depression

23440,I have always had bouts of depression and anxiety. I am on meds. For the past month my first thought right when i open my eyes is death. Death as in disappointment at my life and another day. But when i seriously consider suicide i get even sadder at the thought of not being here anymore. As background I am 42 female ivy league educated USED to be very pretty. In past 3 years i feel I have progressively become more pathetic and useless. I only see aging lonliness sickness and struggles ahead. Whereas i used to live in a nice high rise have friends had a nice shape felt healthier felt pretty worked a reputable job etc now I have gained 35lbs going from 115lb to 150lb my hairs thinned out I am stuck living with my parents after i moved here to help temporarily but now cannot get my shit together to move back to my homestate have no friends fertility is shot according to doc n will likely never have kids ever i feel ugly snd i work a shitty contract job. Plus I have had horrible heartburn and nausea for weeks and meds are not working. I am in therapy but feels like i have a new setback each time i start to try to make progress mostly health anxiety related or an actual life event.idk I am rambling. Sorry. I am just so sad anxious and do not know what to do. Everything seems dark. 42 years old fatty and infertile.,Depression
40884,dil shikastagi isn t quite the same a depression but nice word nonetheless very apt for me,Depression
26620,Trigger warNING!! MenTION of suicIDAL thougHTS!!I feel so unloved. I do not think I have any friends anymore. The friends I used to have just got popular and I guess they do not have time for me anymore. No one answers my messages or pays any attention to me except for a few close family members. I just do not understand what is so unlovable about me.Sure of course I have a lot of flaws. I have crippling social anxiety gen. anxiety and a learning disorder as well as other mental health issues so I guess I can isolate myself at times because of that and I have trouble holding a conversation and struggle with social skills. But even when I do reach out to people they just ignore me. it is so painful being blatantly ignored by my friends while I see them post pictures online of them with spending time with other people. I just do not understand what is so unlovable about me.I wish someone would just tell me. I do not want to be your friend anymore because you are boring I do not like you anymore because you are extremely ugly fuck idk I just hate having to wonder. it is like I am cursed to be lonely for my whole life. And it honestly causes me to have suicidal thoughts.If I am never going to have friends or anyone who truly cares about me I would rather just put myself out of my misery than live like this. I just feel so disgusted by myself because there must be something wrong with me for my life to be this way. I do not know I guess that is just what on my mind. I really appreciate any support I may receive and being able to share how I feel. So thanks for listening. Isolation,Depression
7454,I am really fuckin sad I am in this summer term for college and I cannot control myself or anything around me I feel like I am worthless I do not have any friends I try to open up to people but I just cannot I am struggling like never before,Depression
9738,I used to feel empty inside almost all the time. it is like a void inside which seems like nonfillable but few months back I decided to do something about it. I did not want to feel like crap all the time. So I started on self development.I started small like waking up early instead of sleeping till 10 or 11 am and letting my depression and sadness sink in . Then when It became slightly bearable I started programming again I used to be good at it but my depression took the fun out it. I admit this was a hard road since I was out of practice and when I was unable to code. I used to think how I wasted so many years being depressed and thus subconsciously slipping into it again.Again I had to pull myself together.This feels like never ending process since I have been depressed half of my life I am 23M p but atleast I was not that sad anymore.So six months down the line.I am brushing up my maths important for programmingWorking out few times a week.Learning guitar bought it years back but you know depressionI have still social anxiety and I am social awkward but that is another days problem. Right now I am working on my depression. Filling the void.,Depression

15514,I have had enough I am going to fucking end it today. I have suffered enough and cannot take it anymore. Any last things to do? End it,Depression
10443,I feel like an island. Over the past year it seems like I have drifted away from everyone in my life to the point where it feels like I have lost the ability to maintain meaningful relationships. I feel extremely isolated from others like I am trapped in my own mind. People that used to make me really happy I now feel an indifference towards or worse they make me extremely angry. New people that come into my life seem so bland and uninteresting. Every interaction I have with another person feels so fake. All my responses in conversation feel rehearsed and not genuine its like instead of actually being apart of a conversation I am an actor that has their lines already memorized or a robot with a set of prewritten responses. At the same time I have developed a very short temper when it comes to talking to people. An otherwise benign statement or conversation topic will instantly sour my mood and when people make mistakes I just cannot seem to let it go and in my head I actively hold it against them. Everyone disappoints me. Maybe I should just isolate myself from society for a while and cut out all of my friends and family. If I do not I worry that I will eventually hate anyone that ever cared for me. What the fuck is wrong with me I cannot connect with anyone,Depression
39190,over the past couple month i have been suffering a lot with my anxiety i am in an environment where i am surrounded by people who dont care for me are blantantly rude and fake and pressure me beyond belief i am exhausted and want to be happy i m not saying for a second that i am perfect and nice all the time im a know it all socially awkward lack of an ability to stand up for myself but i miss being around the few people that love me and share my interest while i am around bad people i am in a place where i am in a place surrounded by thing i love i cant miss out on this i need to grow and be more confident i can live an adventurous life alone i dont need company i dont need a boyfriend and i don t need friend with me all the time i have been taking leap and going to museum and social public setting all by myself ivd been taking it slow and going to one place everyday or every other day i allow myself to lay in bed after and sleep i am so unbelieveably anxiois and distressed when i am out doing these thing but i am seeing thing i truly love i am experiemcing life i am going on an oit of city trip for a few day soon and i am excited to push my limit a i lay im bed stressed in pain and sleep deprived i am still pushing myself in the morning to go on another adventure by myself,Depression
15143,I love to collect cute notebooks but never knows what to do with it I tried Bullet Journaling but cannot stick to it. I am trying to occup myself with nice things but depression makes it difficult. I am also not very creative I would like to be but I am bad at drawing writing and many other things... Still I would like to find fun uses of notebooks and get out of my head a little. Any ideas ? Idea of uses for a notebook ?,Depression
17397,Note English is not my first language therefore the text might not be gramatically correct but I will do my best. ampx200BSo before i even go on I will throw in a bit of context My best friend from high school let us call him D was into this girl since the first year of HS and they eventually got together at the start of the third year. I always had weird relationships that did not last too long so i decided to take a break from relationships and focus on myself to realize who i want to be and stuff. Anyways i get to know this girl let us call her K who is the bestfriend of D's GF. We hangout a few times and eventually decide that it would be cool if we start dating. So we are together since New Year's and that is where things start to get messy. Whenever something bad happens between me and K D always knows and blames it all on me mocks me in front of K and his GF and just makes me feel worthless. K D and D's gf also started to leave me out of any plans be it camping or hanging out. I just feel like I am no one's number 1. If i just break up with K I will get D and D's gf blaming me the entire 4th year of HS because they are also my classmates. Never ever have i felt more trapped than now. I do not have anyone to talk to because i lost a lot of friends because K did not want me to talk to many people. My parents are always working tired and generally in a bad mood. ampx200BI just...cannot. I feel so done at this point and i do not think anything matters at this point. Might be a mood swing but i feel really down,Depression
13983,I worked really hard today and did alot. I came home and realized I forgot to organize something. I feel like shit now like the last nine hours of work did not matter. Sorry I know this is pathetic. Can someone tell me I did good?,Depression
10040,I mean I am spiraling out of control and the worst I have ever been but I cannot tell anyone instead I push everyone away from me in a weird way of self harmingbeing self destructive. I drink too much refuse therapy and can feel myself loosing grip of reality and control of my life but no one cares so why should I. I have all I could ever wish for right? Successful in my career a girlfriend new apartment etc. still I am at the lowest I have probably ever been.. I am 21 but I have a plan for how to kms for the first time since I was 17 and I am worried of how close I am to actually doing it and how easy it would be but I cannot do that to my girlfriend and family. I have pushed all my friends away so I do not think they would care too much. Sorry for a messy rant I just had to vent I wish it was ok to say fucking terrible when someone asks how it is going,Depression
47654,Is it normal to be scared of getting help? I don't know why but I just feel like I'm gonna get judged in some way like if I'm gonna try and get help that I'll just be told some sorry excuse of a conclusion that they came to by looking at a piece of paper I had to fill out in the waiting room.The only way I can really describe it by is that I feel like I'm not good enough. It just makes me feel even more helpless than I already feel.I know I'm probably overthinking this which in itself is a whole other problem but I can't stop myself.,Depression
20093,I wonder every night why is to why I am still on this train called life I feel like I should have gotten off a very long time ago. I feel like I deserve help or maybe I do not want it I do not have the self confidence to love myself nor do I have brains to fix little things about meI feel like a broken toy that cannot be fixed. The weird thing is I only feel this way at night which is why I go to sleep when ever I feel this way but I read that this is a bad way to cope with depression. Id been thinking of reasons as to why I want to live and I do not have any I know if I end it right now it will selfish to others but is its it selfish to they to want me to stay here and suffer. By the way I have a 21 year old female Why am I still on this train call life,Depression
19197,I endlessly lie about the pettiest of things to everyone I know.Just to make myself sound better than what I actually am.I cannot stop because I cannot seem to improve.I am constantly running in place. I cannot quit lying,Depression
38043,i feel so tired so exhausted i sleep most of the day away and have no reason to get up thing are hard and my life is in a bad spot on one had i feel like i wan na let go and let the tear flow but on the other hand i just feel so empty and they don t even wan na come out i just sit here staring at the same spot in the wall with no drive to do anything anymore i m not sure the anti depressents are even helping me much anymore they re gon na run out soon anyways because of some bullshit with my insurance that s nice i just feel like i need to get out get some where far away and if i don t soon thing are gon na end badly i have nightmare about my emotional support animal dying still it s so hard to get over it my friend keep checking in on me because i m not active and say it s fine and i can vent but i feel i m letting them down i don t even drink to escape and feel like i can t anyways because an abusive drunk father i had got violent when he did and i m scared of ending up like him this is a vent post so i don t expect any reply out of it i just really needed to let this out and i obviously couldn t tell a therapist because i d just be put in a damn hospital and billed out of my as for it,Depression
47761,Dysthymia I over eat amp under eat. Cant sleep at night and sleep during the day. When I have an episode I hate to call other people because I dont want to bring them down. Sometimes I feel like I cant do anything but lay in bed. I always worry about something bad happening to me. Even though I have hobbies and try do make healthy eating decisions etc. Just ranting because Im crying for no apparent reason and need to vent. I hope everyone is ok. ,Depression
13912,I finally got health insurance for the first time in my life but the copay for therapy is still 50. Which sadly I cannot afford right now I am getting by paycheck to paycheck. Are there other options that you all know of? I have insurance but still cannot afford the 50 copay for therapy. Are there any other options?,Depression
21845,I am so tired of living. I have everything going for me I have a job since past six years I have a wife who is pregnant with our first child I even bought some property with mortgage recently. But all I can think about it ending it all. I have started to hate my work. Every morning I wake up anxious and tired. I cannot quit my job because of the coming kid. I already know that I will not be able to work anywhere else. Everytime anyone scolds me at work or criticize my performance it hurts. I try my best but I am not perfect.I keep on asking myself 'what is the point? Why I am alive even? Am I really useless?' Sigh. All I want is to retire to a mountain place. Or may be death will be better. At least I have insurance so family will be okay. I am so tired.,Depression
13243,He said he was falling to a black hole and he would not want to meet me. it is been 4 months since. I kept texting him and he responded at first. I got worried when he said that he has not seen or talked to any friends. I know his sleeping and eating patterns were crappy even before. His family or other friends does not know about the depression. He said he has seeked help but I have not heard how is it going. He said that my messaged did not bother and he did not block me or anything even when I said he could ig it get overwhelming. it is been 2 months since he responded mey messages. Should I give him space or keep texting? I guess the history of dating makes me anxious that he would just cut all contact with me. Should I keep checking on a depressed guy we used to date but we are just friends now who has withdrew from anyone and has not responded my texts for months?,Depression
38303,this is kind of a weird question this week ha been kind of low and slow life turned into a little more greyscale and i can feel an imminent depressive episode coming to say hey but i don t wan na do that right now i need to be focused right now on school for the near future and it s absolutely the worst time to sulk in my bed every day i know this is a fruitless attempt anyways but how do i block this episode out before my mind shuts down how do i recharge my battery before it even run out fuck you depression fuck you,Depression
24291,i do not want to post this in rtrans bc i do not want my sister to see it so I am sorry. My little sister is MTF transgender and she is in the closet. our family is very conservative and homophobic so coming out would be dangerous. lately she is becoming more and more depressed bc she cannot really be herself. I am so scared that her mental health will worsen and she could become suicidal. she is already saying she has no motivation and wants everything to end. how can i support her more? i have no idea how to help i do not think she would want to go to therapy my parents expect her to be a perfect child and she would not want to ask for therapy and concern them. i know its a difficult situation to give advice on especially since none of you know all the details. but if you have ANY advice i would REALLY appreciate it. i just want her to be okay advice about my trans sister,Depression
21941,I just feel like I have no motivation to do anything anymore nothing gives me happiness and just generally feel alone. The only time I get motivation is when I have a panic attack most of the time I am just sitting on my phone cuz its the only thing giving me a dopamine rush. Christianity helps me feel less alone but even that does not help a lot anymore I just generally sit feeling sorry for myself on days I have nothing else to do. Any feedback is appreciated. Diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder but wondering if its slowly built to depression.,Depression

38799,long story short someone made fun of someone s stutter in front of me cause they weren t aware i have a stutter it s mostly related to anxiety after that i kept asking myself how do i know who i can trust and in that time i told myself i felt crazy for thinking this way i told myself everybody can be made fun of for different aspect of their life and most people won t even bat an eye i wa going about my day until someone on my post said they thought this way and it led them to be paranoid and go psychotic this is my biggest fear and after reading that i almost had a panic attack and it took me 0 0 minute to calm down ever since then i can t shake this thought i realized tho the reason i think everyone care i stutter is because i m looking through my perspective not theirs i realized i wa treating my stutter a my identity and not an aspect of me if someone make a lighthearted joke about it depending on how they say it it could just be a joke and not devaluing me a a person realizing this actually make me feel like a huge weight ha been lifted off of myself but it freak me out cause i also heard before people lose touch with reality they feel great but now that i found a way out of this thought that ocd ha attached itself to it s still going over scenario that never even happened or will happen going over certain people and i m asking myself would they make fun of your stutter in this scenario i m afraid it s because i m paranoid but i think it s cause ocd is trying to keep a grip on this fear it s le of a fear people are making fun of me now and more of a fear of believing they re making fun of me doe this mean i m going crazy since the original thought didn t start a an ocd obsession,Depression

48127,My every day battle Im constantly battling with myself day after day Im kinda get sick of beating myself up over not being good enough for me. Im working hard but I dont feel like Im working hard enough on myself even the way I feel like I need to. Ive gotten off my meds but sometimes it feels like a relapse. Its made my taste in music change things I used to love I dont enjoy anymore friends I dont really connect with many anymore even the people I used to see I dont see any more. My connections seem to be gone.The constants in my life there is maybe 4 of my job my family my friends and where I live. Emotionally Im not well. Physically Im doing better so one thing at a time I guess. Fighting with myself I dont want to do it constantly.,Depression
11495,english is not my mother language sorry if its a bit all over the placethrowaway due to a pointless fear of someone clicking my profile and recognizing mealcohol gambling not even masturbation makes me feel anything anymore. by my own means I have been depressed since 8th grade which makes it almost 8 years by now. I have never seen a future to myself since the age of 14before high school i was kind of a recluse doing my own thing playing my own games on the computer and not very popular but since i discovered parties and alcohol I have been a main man that everyone invites. since then I have gotten along with everyone not depending on gender the sarcastic humorist that everyone needs in their life I have been a shoulder to cry on for males and females and I have always been someone that has given advice to them that they have benefitted from. since high school ended I have noticed that all my friends have gotten some type of lives and I have always been the one who has been included into new friend groups that have formed from those times that have quite not made it yet. but now is the time that these friends have ran out and I am starting to be the only one who cannot move on.I am from quite a dysfunctional family and i am now working a very severe manual labor job that i just do because i could not stay for more than a year in university due to never having learned the ability to study by being able to cruise through high school without any problemsi have no goals in life because everything feels pointless although i realise that it is not pointless because my life and something that i do could matter to someone but i am really at a crossroads now by binge drinking at the weekends but does not seem a fast enough slow suicide. even thought of becoming an opioid addict because id have a point to wake up in the morning to get my next fix. sounds absolutely idiotic i know but this is where I am at noweverytime i get together with my old friends I have acted like its all ok and bullshit my way out of it but I have started to drink more compared to them when i see them and its starting to damage the relationship i have with themits probably a shamble and it took a lot from me to write this since and not delete it like i tried to many times during this post. I have never told this to anybody.also sorry if its the wrong subreddit for this maybe it would fit more to the doomer or whatever subredditi just do not know anymore i guess I am just young and stupid but when will it end absolutely nothing,Depression
47828,Why cant I be above average at 1 one thing? cwmentions of EDMy grades are average. At school I was better than others at languages and took part in olympiads but now that Im in uni I just suck at everything. You can tell me grades dont mean shit and how some smart and talented people didnt do well in terms of academic performance.So what? Im not one of them by any means. Im not good at scientific research in my field either. They say some people naturally think like scientists. They ask the right questions challenge ideas without taking them for granted etc. Im not capable of that.Ive had an ED which allowed me to have an extremely low BMI so for some time I felt like Im better than others at least at something. I was dumb enough to try recovery and now Im technically not even underweight.I had hobbies like chess and drawing but I dont have enough motivation to do them regularly and anyway it would probably take years for me to become just good at it.There are no other areas in my life where I could better than average. This is it. You could tell me being above average should not be that important anyway. Its totally fine if its not for others but for me it would mean a lot. I would feel like my existence isnt absolutely pointless. I cant just live and try to enjoy stuff.Thanks for reading this.,Depression
12090,They never helped anyway. Sometimes I feel I am worse than I have ever been but I just cannot bring myself to call the doctor. I had an appointment scheduled and she cancelled a month ago.

40047,i can t keep running from how empty i feel how everything feel so forced and fake i m and the social problem began from a very young age the familial problem also i guess i learned from a very young age to brush thing under the rug and bury all of my emotion to the point where i ve been detached from myself for probably year now i ve been to therapy different time and am likely starting again soon but to be honest i don t think it s going to go anywhere until i can be honest with myself but i literally don t know how it s like there s this pit of intense pain that s constantly buried deep within my chest that i suppose will either give me answer or kill me from shame all i know is socializing is completely traumatizing to me school a well i don t know if anybody can relate but i just don t know how to figure myself out or if it s just all in my head i must sound so crazy to anybody reading this but please if you have any question it might really help me to be able to answer them anonymously and unpack stuff i m committed to understanding why everybody treat me like i m some freak i know i m not completely hideous but beyond that i don t think i know what s going on there s like this deep disconnect between how i act even by myself and who i am internally i believe i don t know if any of this make sense but please ask about my childhood or whatever i got ta understand even if it kill me,Depression

27134,What is there to life now? Why am I alive?The planet is on fire. The point of no return with climate change is soon.I hate my job. does not matter where it is. The job itself does not make me happy. It makes me hate myself for picking it.I will never be able to afford a home where I grew up. Housing is unafforable.I likely will not find a partner. I tried. I fail. I guess I will keep trying.I am stuck mentally. I just do the same routine every day. I cannot ever progress.I am so bored. So alone. Nothing makes me happy. I just go through the motions until I sleep. Repeat the same process.Medications therapy exercise only mask reality. Deep down I hate myself for existing. I want to die. I Have No Future I Want To Die,Depression

11255,I wish it was only physical and emotional because the cognitive symptoms are disempowering and frankly terrifying. In particular my critical reasoning communication comprehension and fine motor skills are slowed. This literally affects my ability to read write and do arithmetic. I am on Yaz but if I miss a pill its like spinning the Symptom Roulette Wheel. Cognitive PMDD symptoms,Depression
23659,Sometimes I feel like people just will not listen to this simple truth. They always want to blame it on you being the problem. I am going to use some of my disabilities and quirks as an example. First off I was born left handed. When I was a child it was virtually impossible to find people to teach you things left handed. So I learned to do most things outside of writing right handed or tried to learn on my own. This basically cut me off from ever pursuing a career that required precise technical abilities. Think surgeon athlete etc. I was also born with adhd which went undiagnosed until my teen years when learned behavior becomes harder to introduce. I was repeatedly punished because I was treated like the rest of the kids. This had a rather horrible effect on me and forced my thoughts and my self inward later in life. And I believe this is where my life long depression took root. I still to this day struggle with simple tasks that neurotypicals do not even bat an eyelash at. Lastly I was born with the learning disability dyscalculia. I was actually good at math when I had the time and patience to work out the numbers. I only ever had one math teacher who had patience with me and low and behold I excelled that year. The rest of my math life is full of shame yelling and bad grades. Considering all this all I ever hear from therapists family and friends is its all in your head you can do anything I can just as well but I cannot....So why is not it normal for me to be depressed? there is no fix for my two disabilities. I am doomed to be less adjusted and slower than everyone else. When almost every well paying and secure job is out of reach for you you are fucked. I am just so tired of people treating me like a worthless lazy bastard when in reality I am trying 10x harder than most of my peers. Life is objectively unfair for some people,Depression
13665,I keep looking back about 2 years ago and yearn to be that version of myself. I was happy thriving I got excited about things and now I am just floating. I do not feel right. I cannot pinpoint a specific thing that happened that made me this way. I think it was all very gradual. Maybe COVID made it worse? My parents came to visit me recently I have not seen them in a year. Were very close and I was not excited. I had to fake it but all the while I was sitting there like meh. I do not get rushes of adrenaline I do not laugh until I cry I do not feel butterflies I really just do not feel much except that I am just here and existing. What is wrong with me? I have lost myself and I want to find me again,Depression
14140,Why was I born without my consent into a shitty world? And I cannot even leave because my family will be upset and I cannot do that to them.

38258,i m at a very weird place in my life right now i m a year old male in college i m failing my college class a i have no motivation to do well in them i have a very poor relationship with my parent and family the one organization in my college that i m extremely involved with ha cut tie with me over accusation that are not true i have a leadership role in this organization and being a leader in the organization with no prior experience ha brought me a ton of hater and people that just want to see my downfall i literally have no future a i m supposed to graduate this semester and get a job but i am nowhere near both i can t pursue my real passion and to top it all of and what really might put me over the edge is problem with this woman in my life we met through this organization that i wa talking about earlier in this text a a captain i have my own committee of people that i oversee and she wa one of my committee member the first time we hung out in october she took me out to a bar after i turned it wa just me and her we quickly started to develop this really cool friendship where d we hangout and talk almost daily a a young man hopeless in love i started to develop feeling but nothing crazy because i almost always saw her a a best friend first and i m sure she felt the same way then we were at a bar about a month ago she wa talking to some guy at the bar and i wa having a funny conversation with my friend but i could see from the corner of my eye that she wa talking to this man and that s when i first started feeling these feeling of jealousy but i could tell she wa looking at me too talking to my friend and she came to me and we embraced and i hugged her almost all night had my arm around her and everything and she had her hand over mine too and we just kept feeling each other this wa the first time we ever moved into this phase of our friendship and i think we both felt something brewing in our heart for one another a few day went by and i wa out yet again talking to this other chick i met at the bar and we ended up almost hooking up back at my place but i couldn t go through with it because all i could think about wa my best friend who i really liked i m an introvert at heart and will always keep my feeling inside because i m scared to tell people how i feel and i suppress those feeling but literally the next day after this hookup that didn t happen i wa at a friend s st birthday party and got hammered myself and i had this urge of wanting to tell my best friend how i truly felt about her and that s exactly what i did it wa a thursday night she always go to this one specific club on thursday night so i ditched my friend and went to that club to see her and it literally played out like a romantic film she wa the first person i saw when i walked in and went up to her and for the first time in my life i poured my heart out to her and told her how i felt about her and how she make me feel and at first she wa shocked and then she said she felt the same way and we kissed for a long time at this moment i wa on cloud 9 i had never had a girlfriend before had never been in a relationship before but in this moment it wa just me and her against the world and i loved it we started to head back to my apartment but the alcohol wa kicking in for me and i passed out once i got back to my apartment i woke up the next day and saw her heel on the floor but she wa nowhere to be found so i texted her and told her that i wa sorry for passing out from the alcohol but i meant every word i told her last night she didn t text me back till later that day and she said that she wa thinking about it all day and night and she didn t want to fuck up our friendship a it s one of the few good thing in her life right now and i totally get that wa i disappointed hearing this yeah of course i wa but i texted her back saying that we can talk about this in person another time but for right now enjoy your weekend the next day we saw each other at a party and i talked to her outside and told her that i d rather say we tried to make it work and it didn t rather than not giving u a chance at all and she never gave me a clear answer she texted me later that night saying that she needed a break and some time to think so i said okay a few day later we had our last committee meeting and it wa so awkward cause we hadn t talked before and we were on this so called break and after the meeting ended she immediately left even though she usually wait for me i got a text from her later that night around am saying that this letter i wrote for everyone on my committee wa very sweet and cute and i asked her how long this break should last and she said she wasn t sure a she didn t want me to think that she wa leading me on which i thought she wa doing so we hopped on this facetime call and had a really nice long conversation about all the stuff we had to catch up on and then after an hour i switched the topic back to our relationship and she basically said that she didn t feel the same way i wa so hurt when she said this because all the sign pointed to her liking me too and i really felt like i knew what her heart wa saying we both went to sleep cry that night for each other the next day i sent her a text this time saying that i do need some space to figure thing out and we can talk after spring break so for the next week we didn t talk she didn t view my story like any of my social medium post and just simply didn t communicate with each other and it wa one of the worst thing for me to go through a she wa someone i really looked forward to talking to and to not be able to do that just sucked the sunday before we came back to college i texted her and asked if she d be down to hangout that first week we got back and she said she wa down to do so and i wa so happy because it felt like i wa getting my friend back again but then a few day later she angrily text me asking if i told anyone that we hooked up which isn t true and i told her that i didn t which is true there were rumor going around about u from people that saw u hangout a lot that saw u embrace at the bar that saw u kiss at the club and saw u walk back to my apartment together so people could only assume that we were a thing and i kept telling her that but she wasn t having it she facetimed me saying that she regretted ever kissing me she didn t want to be friend anymore and all this shit i wa extremely hurt hearing this and just wanted my friend back and wanted to forget ever opening up my feeling for her so i sent her a really long text explaining that i never said anything that i really cared about her and just wanted my best friend back she responded by saying that she appreciated me reaching out and that she wa over the situation and that she s not ready to move forward with me and doesn t think our friendship will ever be the same so i texted her this morning and i said i get it and if there wa any way we could meet in person and just talk she responded back by saying that she s potentially open to it but not now maybe next week so i said i just genuinely need someone to talk to but i understand her the last text

39402,i just started a new job week ago i work there day a week for hour just to pay my bill while i m studying so far i ve been dreading every single day so much that i m actually super nervous the day before and it seems like it s not getting better at all i still feel like i know barely anything and i have to ask my coworkers about literally everything and i m insanely anxious and uncomfortable in that work environment i honestly don t even know why or what exactly the issue is but i m having a really hard time feeling at home there if i remember correctly my last job wa completely fine after a week it s funny because it s just stocking shelf at a supermarket in the morning that s my job and i m anxious about it so how long do you think it ll take to get comfortable to actually not being scared a hell of going there,Depression
12571,I am not sure where to start. November of 2020 I moved across the country with my boyfriend who four months later died of an accidental overdose. I decided to move back home after where my support system is at. Its been 4 months since he has passed away since I have been home with my parents. I am just dealing with grief and depression. I decided to start taking Lexapro which has helped to deal with the tremendous amount of suffering. I am 26 and I lack so much purpose. I do not have a career I do not have a job I am living at home and every day I tell myself Ill do something different today and sure enough just fall back into my same bad habits. I started smoking cigarettes which are not even my thing and I told myself I would not drink anymore since he passed but now I see myself start drinking a glass or two of wine a night. I am just so depressed and stuck. I want to run away to somewhere new but I know the same problems will follow. I want to go back to school but then I just do not even follow through. I am just so lost feeling and I am scared to be stuck in a position for too long. I keep living in the past of the mistakes I made with my boyfriend. I know I am battling depression. I just do not know how long I can keep doing the same thing every day with zero new routine or zero purposes. I am just venting if you made it this far I appreciate you reading. Lacking so much purpose.,Depression
16501,Hello all I have been a long time lurker and this is my first time posting. I am 27M and I graduated college recently and since then I have been working at a new full time job related to my major. Most of my days during the weekday is usually spent in the office from 97 or so and after work I just sit at home all by myself playing games. I just moved out of my parents to a place all to myself. I have had depression for the longest time and me moving into a place all by myself is making me realize I am all alone. My ex 5 months of dating who I came to the closest to loving someone and I broke almost 3 months ago now and I have gotten over things quickly but its hard to get over her. Since then my depression has just gotten worse. I have tried to reach out but she does not respond to my messages. Life is just depressing and just sucks. New chapter of my life is lonely as hell,Depression
24535,i think it is finally time. the end of my life. the time i take my own life. it was a really hard life not worth living this long for. i was depressed for as long as i could feel complex emotions. i never had anything going for me. i never really worked hard for anything. i never found a purpose. i never loved something. however the past three years I have had someone who i loved with everything i am. i feel like i lost him last night. he says he loves me but his voice and his words feel so empty. i think he is given up on me. which is fair i put him through a lot. i do not blame him. I am really going to miss him. he gave me a reason to live. he has this whole life in front of him of being really successful. he is worked really hard the past few years to build himself a life worth living. I am so proud of him. he is going to do so much. I am glad i lived this long to love him watch him become who he is today and to experience love with him. I am so lucky to have had someone so amazing. i only wish i was able to say goodbye and know it would be the last time. but it is okay. i know this day would come. he was the last thing i had. i knew i would not live much longer when he would leave me. my whole world has just been pain. hopefully in some other life i can meet him again and maybe things would work out. this is not a cry for help. i do not want sympathy. i just needed to say this to someone anyone. i needed an outlet. i needed to say something to someone so i could feel a bit of peace when i pass. someone just needs to know... it is my time,Depression
39112,i thought it wa an interesting way to look at it and wanted to share with you all,Depression
14174,Or just given any sort of personal attention. I swear the complete lack of it devastates me sometimes but there is very few I am comfortable with. Its so hard When was the last time you were hugged,Depression
14235,I just want to thank the people who shared their experiences here and I realized that I am not alone... Even if I did not share my experiences... The experiences they shared showed me that there are people that are experiencing much worse situation than me. I want to be there for them just like this subreddit was here for me. I cannot believe that I will say this.. but Reddit cured my depression. Thank you all and hope you all recover D I recovered,Depression
25195,hello i am a 16 year old arab female.I have been depressed for a long time. I have been at my worst these past days. can someone teach me how to od on prescription drugs. I do not want to die i just want to get my parents attention. they are very strict and are not listening to me and took away my phone and are threatning to break it and give me a flip phone. I got caught in my bfs car when my parents do not know abt him. They have caught me texting him before but never linking with him. My parents are very strict arab muslims. They have taken my phone for months before already. I just cannot stand to have no communication with my bf of a year and a half. Have no communication with my friends or be allowed to leave the house. I have tried telling my parents before that I am depressed but they never listened. I just cannot do this anymore. I do not want anyone telling me not to od either. Just tell me how to do it. I am at my breaking point. how to od with prescription drugs without dying,Depression
16057,I do not feel like I have felt true happiness for a very long time. Sure I can distract myself with friends and books or shows maybe get a laugh or two but as soon as I have time alone to truly just think I realize how miserable I am or how I had put on a face the entire time I was with other people. And when I am not sad I am just completely numb. I am always either numb or sad,Depression
39183,i m starting to feel afraid that my husband is trying to sneak stuff into my food i wa feeling this way then he finished making food for tonight and i told him i wasn t hungry but he kept pressuring me to eat which made me feel even worse i ate some of the food because everyone got food from the same container so i felt like it would be ok i don t believe that he would do this but i also don t believe he wouldn t i feel sick to my stomach with anxiety,Depression
14666,I want to know about this one because my girlfriend kept on telling me that. Before it happened she was ranting about her Uncle who keeps on letting her dog out the reason why she does not wants it out is because of the parvo virus or any infectious diseases that her dog might get. I was kind of sleepy during that time and was falling asleep but when she calls I suddenly wake up. The moment she knew about me falling asleep she became even furious and kept on throwing she wants every people to die but also tells I should die first then my family next. She also does not wants me to eat. Is this normal? Is wanting someone or all people die inclined with depression or any other mental illness?,Depression

8708,I have been depressed for a while and one of my comfort shows is greys. The only downside is that it induces me to be even more depressed and oh god I just had a full on breakdown. 007 if you know you know. And the way Meredith was talking like this could be your last day and be with the ones you love. Now I am feeling very impulsive. there is this boy I love. We decided to stop talking and get back together when were both mature but now I am like what if he dies. God what do I do. Do you all ever feel like this Season 5 finale,Depression
47451,I guess Im an acceptance. Seems to be a theme hear about taking hints. A lot of these posts come in waves.Basically dont choose someone who didnt choose you. If theyre fine without you in their life then never take them back when they come back. People who are OK with you not being in their lives are not worth your mental wellbeing. In the past when I had read these I never really understood them. I do now. As hard as it is for me to accept because to accept it means its real. They never cared. They left. Theyre gone. Forever. They never coming back. They never wanted to. Im their now. Its been a long road. A painful journey. One that Ill never repeat again in my life.ever!!! it isnt over yet. And by that I mean the outcome of me. I know I will not be that same I was before I met my ex person. I dont know if Ill have that positive and exciting outlook on life anymore. I dont even know if Ill have the motivating desire to want a better in life that I had when met my ex. Large part of me went silent. You could even see a large part of my died. The part of me that started to actually want to live and enjoy life..I didnt have that part of me growing up even into my early adulthood. I listened eagerly to her stories. I told her mine. I did whatever I could to make her dailies a little easier. To give her a reason to smile. If it was sending her dinners a random bouquet of flowers with some chocolate and a teddy or just telling her a joke..mostly bad onesI tried my best to show my person I loved her. To me she was the world my tomorrows my happy my love my life MY ONEBut to her I was no one special. In her own words there was nothing special about me.She took the best parts. She got better. She had options. She chose. She didnt choose me. I was the one she chose one she had no one else to choose from. That was what I was to her. That was my value to her. I have finally excepted this. I cant lie to myself anymore. She chooses not to be in my life and she chooses to ghost. I dont know what tomorrow will hold. But I know I dont want to see it. The pain within me only increases. They say with time things get better. For me it seems to be the opposite. Ive always been different. Maybe that is my curse. Im not like the crowd. Doesnt seem to be a good thing for me more like a curse.I shouldve remain secluded. I shouldve remained to myself. I shouldve known that no one would understand. I shouldve known no one would care.,Depression

10044,Hello I am alex 18 yo. From July I am not ok because my friends betray me and my gf do not give a f.ck about me and my life. I feel like I am alone and i just want to be happy and have fun with people who understand me. But i cannot find them... I am alone and i think i have depression. I am not ok,Depression
23797,My life feels to be falling apart. I do not know how to explain it other than my limbs all being stretched and physically unraveling and dislodging. My brain is rot and my insides are rot. Rotted goop. I do not have a purpose in life I have no dreams in life I am wasting away the prime of my life. I dive into my eating disorder to cope and get high sometimes and selfharm. Therapy for me of 3 years failed and my therapist took an indefinite leave so that went down the drain. My psychiatrist is cool but I have tried 15 meds and nothing really works. I cannot figure out this big issue in my life and I repeatedly obsess and ruminate over it with no answers or solutions as I sit paralyzed in fear. I think I just realized today that my depression has been getting worse in ways I did not recognize as I have gone up on this new medication. Talking to people has become more of a chore than it used to be. It gets on my nerves to have to speak up or when anyone talks to me. I do not care to talk about anything I am interested in anymore. I used to at least have some interest in certain topics but now I just do not care and I do not want to talk to anyone. Every word said to me or that I say is a fork on a chalkboard. I have to psych myself up to raise my voice and speak. I do not care about doing things I used to do with friends. Well I care less anyway. Or more like I am just indifferent. Numbed out... I still care. But it does not feel as...there? It feels like I am wearing emotioncanceling headphones. it is all still there but it is so muted. I cannot stay awake during the day at work at all. Worse now than before. I find myself seeming to play less with my wonderful pets...I have lost credibility at work and plateaued with my ability. And I just do not care anymore. It makes me feel bad but I do not care enough to do anything about it at all. I realize I suck at my work but so what. I have already failed I still fail. So what... My motivation was already shit but now it is more like I do not care... I used to be upset that my motivation was gone angry about it in a sense? And now I kind of just do not give a shit. I recognize that my motivation is still gone and sure it is still upsetting but not as upsetting as it was because I do not feel the anger at myself as much. Occasionally I have bursts of extreme emotion like yesterday I had a MAJOR anger rage moment where I had to take anti anxiety meds to even remotely start to calm down after a period of screaming slamming things around and knocking things over and selfharming viciously in a frenzy. Some days I burst into tears for all night and just keep a rag with me to soak up the tears as the time passes and I try to do things that fall within my normal schedule and small range of activities I do once I go home from work. Every day is a repeat of the day before. Week by week. All the same. it is Monday then suddenly Friday. Then the weekend. Then Monday...repeat. I do not care about any of it. Monday Wednesday Sunday...whatever. All the same. The best part of my day is when I get to come home from work and have a binge and purge episode for like 23 hours. that is literally the most I look forward to. And even that is starting to fade out. Everything is faded. Everything is muted. At random times I explode but then the monotony sets back in and I find myself almost in a stupor of some kind. My life is meaningless and I want it to be over. I do not want to commit suicide I just want to not exist. I do not want to kill myself I just do not want to exist,Depression
15217,So my friend was going through a hard time and decided to write a poem about it. He wanted to know what people thought about it so I thought I would come here on his behalf! What are your thoughts on it? here is the poemWhen the day comesAnd I am not here anymoreJust know that I triedI tried so hardBut when you are this broken it is not easy to fix yourself You can try and fight But you will have to do it every dayEvery hour Every minute Every second There is no rest it is a constant battle With your demonsAnd you are tired you are weakYou're exhausted This is not a life Not a life worth living My friends poem,Depression

23144,I used to be the master of fake it til you make it. Hiding my ED masking my hopelessness but lately I cannot even do that. Talking to people is a chore. Spending time w my bf used to be the only thing that made me feel something other than grief and irritation but lately it takes too much energy to even speak.Thinking is a chore. Forcing myself to sleep is a chore but sleeping is the closest I can get to not existing so I do it anyways. Writing this is a chore I cannot even fake it anymore,Depression
16597,i just deleted social media from time to time and i do not want to talk to anybody do not even to my parents. i do not have real friends. my dad frequently picking on me from the begining when is was little. i feel no emotions. I am thinking about suicide but i fear to do it.sorry for my bad english I am from hungary why am i,Depression
38409,i don t really have any kind of hope that any other kind of love can truly save you it ha to be romantic because you don t trust friend or family when they tell you that the love you anymore but if someone is willing to hold you and stay with you for the rest of your life just the initiative make it feel better but my problem doesn t even lie there the real problem is that i don t really see myself a someone that can be loved and the reason are endless i m not good looking i have severe social anxiety and i m just a handful of a person to deal with haha and i definitely am not a person that should have been born and even the one time i gave my heart to someone and tried to get to know them better with the hope of igniting something real it wa a fail and i can t help that i have no will left in me to live i don t think writing this post will really achieve anything ultimately but well it would be nice if someone could try to understand me,Depression

19101,I miss my home but my home is destroyed I am from a small town in Venezuela the president of the country set regulations for everything on the basis of socialism what ended up happening was that private companies could not produce and make a profit while selling at the prices the government forced them to there is no toilet paper no rice no pasta no toothpaste no food you cannot buy bread because there is no flour the only companies producing are the companies the government took and they can afford to sell at those prices since they are subsidized by the oil prices and as you can imagine they often fluctuate This crisis caused over 5.4 million Venezuelans to leave the country since the socalled Revolution started current politicians cannot travel to the US because they are investigated for their relations with Drug Cartels I grew up in a city where I used to see every week trucks loaded with dead bodies of people who would try to go to the mines for gold and would get murdered in there as this is a territory controlled by the military which can do whatever they want since they are backed up by the government which gets their cut of the gold and diamond supplyIt hurts me how some people in the country where I live is deeply convinced we have everything in Venezuela or talk greatly about our president when I have friends who were murdered or incarcerated for literally twitting against the regimen If you are wondering why we do not protest like Cuba is doing right now a little history lesson for you every time we do it the president sends the military to murder us the internet is loaded with pictures of this to give you one example of the most brutal one we had this member of the military who tried to reveal against the government his name was scar Alberto Prez they tracked him down and killed him with a rocket launcher yes you read that right they threw a missile to the hose where he was staying with woman and kids. USA Canada and other countries imposed sanctions on the Politicians about 2 years ago freezing their assets and bank accounts and people all over the internet talks about how the USA is doing bad to Venezuela this drives me nuts if you know anything about the Venezuelan history at least respect our country by realizing that Chavez and Maduro have done more damage to us than the USA has. We do not see a light at the end of the tunnelit is hard to see the place where you grew up to go from the promised land to complete decadence. I miss my home but there is no more home my story as an immigrant from Venezuela.,Depression

20500,I am have no real friends no one to meet irl no one to hang out with and the only people I interact with is my family and the occasional cashier. I have a small group of friends that I play games with but I have no one to meet with and its lonely. Where I live there is nothing to do so its not like I can go out and find friends. I am stuck like this. I am going of to a city for Uni in september so there is chances I will meet people there. But I do not think I even want to. The thought of socialising with strangers and meeting new people just does not interest me and I have a strong feeling my depression is going to get a worse dramatically. As my living area will just be a small bedroom. Just trapped in a small room with nothing to do. rant over I have no real friends,Depression

13605,Gunna be honest. I am not sure what i have to say or really how to express myself so here goes nothing. I feel like a empty sliced open yoga ball. Deflated defeated by the angry self distructive voices inside of myself but still so hungry for every drop of hope that i will become the legend my mother told me I would become.So tonight is a drink and try to cry it out night which i do not do very often I think about it very often. I am attempting to drown out the sorrow with high energy music problem is I have never been to a Psychologist yet and i still have a long wait ahead of me until i recieve my first. I am 27. And from the south.I ran away from there due to a bad relationship with my Ex. The woman who had my first and only bio child.We were both young and emotionallymentally broken. We thought we wantedneeded a child to be valued and grow forward. The part we forgot to participate in was the self discovery and self exploration in the late teens to midearly twenties.Instead we pushed different things into our relationship trying to bandage the scraps and bleeds. Day after day filled with yelling we degraded each other. And seeing as the south does not have any truely functioning mental health knowledgesystem we had no idea what we where doing to each other and all the ramifications of those 6 years. I chose to remove myself from the situation by moving to Oregon from Texas because i felt that if i continued on that specific path that I would choose to off myself. Instead I chose more pain but higher benefit for my son Live and choose to learn to be better so that he can have his father one day 100.Now. I am in a relationship with a mother of two girls here and while the circumstances have changed I have not i guess. Becquse the depression is getting worse despite having a seemingly healthier relathionship and trying my FUCKING BEST every god damn day to learn about my demons and how to conquer the storm within but it seems that between the pain of the trauma of the past physical and mental PTSD from life..... IdkThis is a everyday hard god damn fight. And I am not going to give up. But fuckSitting here with my whiskey smokes smoke and tears running down my face just wondering what the fuck I am doing and where the fuck I am going. I feel like If i did not have to fight myself EVERY GOD DAMN DAY I could put all my energy toward changing the world. Instead of reminding myself to just drink water and take a shower.... some advice would be nice right about now....or just....another human.... Just struggling,Depression
15738,Why do i hate happiness so much. I fucking hate laughter so much its so annoying. I hate everything happy. Why cannot the world just be normal. Maybe it is because I hate not being able to see what is happy in situations. I cannot fucking process anything in my shitty brain. Why is going to the beach so fun? Why do people like to be tanned? It hurts to fucking badly. what is fun about having children? what is fun about staying up late? Why do not people have routines it is so much easier. I cannot fucking live like this. I have no memories of me being happy as a child and I fucking hate it. Why is my family so fucking annoying and do not bother trying to understand me? Why do people like romance or comedy?Today I was at the beach with my mum and brother and they were having 'fun'. But me I was sitting in the tent fucking crying cos it is too hot for me to do anything. It was so fucking noisy I hate it all. I am such a fucking disappointment. Why was I born. Why?,Depression

25604,I am 15 my dad is never home and my mom is in a different state the city is 2 hours away and i do not have any form of transport.I am not diagnosed but I have felt incredibly sad angry and done with everything for years.I had a horrible childhood my mom was horribly abusive both mentally and physically i never had any friends quite literally because of how scared of people i am and school has put even more of strain on my mental health. Even with good grades.My mom has diagnosed BPD and depression. My sister has diagnosed bipolar 2 social anxiety ptsd and depression so what are the chances of me having these same problems?I want to go somewhere to try and find out what is wrong with me get a diagnosis for SOMETHING and at least try to figure out my problems but i have no way to do so.Should i try and convince my dad to drive me into the city? I have insurance. At this point all i need to do is have someone else help me is it worth it? My dad is incredibly busy with work he never gets time off. I do not even know if there is something wrong with me at all but a self diagnosis will not do anything. I feel like not knowing for sure is making it worse Is it worth it to try and figure out if something wrong with me?,Depression

48201,Mmm just some thoughts if you can relate congrats I dont feel loved. I dont feel like I have any support. I dont feel like I can go to anyone and I can tell them exactly how I am feeling because theyre gonna quote some bullshit Bible verse or tell me Im being so dramatic. My mom doesnt like listening to me talk but little does she know she needs to cherish my ramblings cause one day Im gonna just jump in front of the G train and shes gonna wish she listened to me cause it would be her last day hearing my voice. I want to spend the rest of my life doing something Im passionate about that I simply dont care if Im gonna make any money at all. I want to feel something so bad but I feel nothing. I have no real goals no real accomplishments no real aspirations.And Im trying so hard to see the brighter side. Im trying so hard to be positive. Im trying so hard to find the balance but its not working. Its times like this when Im sitting in silence where there are no sounds and I dont have my headphones to drown out all these negative thoughts. I have to sit with them in silence suffering.I want friends and I want to build meaningful relationships with people but people are just so tiring I hated having friends but brushed it off as maybe I wasnt friends with the right people. They were so overwhelming I just wanted to be quiet all the time. I dont know. I dont know whether I want to die or if I want to live. If I live my life it wont be mine and if I die supposedly my life wont be mine either according to some book of stories.,Depression

48275,Honestly which antidepressant withdrawal is not poop? I go to every sub in Bupropion Escitalopram Paroxetine Effexor Sertraline Duloxetine Mirtazapine Amitriptyline Fluoxetine and I can list more but every sub says this med has the worst withdrawal.Yeah withdrawals and discontinuation syndromes suck. But discouraging people from taking medication X that his doc prescribed now he's scared to take it is immoral.You had this experience fine doesn't mean he will. I saw a post on someone taking clonazepam for years on 6 mgs a day.He stupidly coldturkey'd one day and even months later he had no withdrawals. Other's might have lethal seizures.It's very annoying to see a question about medication X and then tons of comments practically tell him not to take it because of withdrawals. Withdrawals are normal so are discontinuation syndromes. You must go through it for 1 2 weeks yes very uncomfortable. I also suffered it. But this is not a reason to discourage someone to take the medication he was prescribed for his illness.Not to mention he is not you. HeShe might not experience the same things you did.Nice day ladies and gentlemen,Depression
9782,This is this first time I have ever made a post here on reddit so I apologize in advance for this not being very well written. I have had clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder since I was 13 years old I am now 18. This summer I have reached an ATL or an all time low. I was hospitalized in January of this year and did not think my situation could get worse from there. I was wrong. I have driven away all of my friends with my erratic behavior and selfish choices including my best friend from high school who I considered to be a platonic soul mate. I miss them and think about them every day but they want nothing to do with me. I have never felt more alone than I have this summer. Luckily my boyfriend of 2 years has stuck around but today I found out that I am pregnant with his child. I am going to college in the fall and I am not ready to be a parent. The only logical option I have is to get an abortion I have scheduled one for the end of this week. I am terrified about paying for it I am a dependent on my parent's insurance but they are catholic and cannot know about what is going on. I already feel an immense amount of guilt about screwing up and getting pregnant in the first place I do not need or want my parents to think of me as a murderer on top of that. I feel incredibly hopeless and guilty and like the world's biggest fuck up. I am scared and I feel like no one around me can help. All time low somehow just got lower,Depression
11613,For me it is when I have time to sit and think about things. What do I want to do what is missing? it is when I realize how much fun I used to be. And how much fun life used to be. I suppose it is depressing when you begin to realize that the older you get the less there is to look forward to and diminished excitement increases while your energy levels and motivation sets new lows with each passing week. Nothing helps anymore. Numbers in the bank account nice things spare time excercise not even time with family. Because something else I realized I do not know anybody anymore and now nobody knows me. Not the real me. there is just this now. This thing that is leftover after society poor decisions and everyone else has done their thing to me. Poor decisions. Faith in the wrong people. I am starting to think that life itself was a poor decision. I tried before haphazardly honestly out of boredom. I was literally so bored and alone that I literally tried suicide because fuck it why not? Sounded fun at the time. Now I only enjoy things vicariously through others. Like a ghost. Life has become a spectator sport. And you just watch and wait for the clock to wind down because there is nothing else of interest to do or it involves other people and I do not want to ruin anyone's day or life anymore. there is more but who cares anyway? I could write a book on this shit but so what? Who would read it? This society's become a dead end for people like me. And now honestly I do not even care anymore. it is been fun here and there I guess. What depresses you the most?,Depression
10099,Last night I had nightmares about my girlfriend cheating on me. This is the first time this has ever happened. we are in a loving relationship and the sex is great. she is honestly the best thing in my life. The only ray of light in my hell hole of a life. I guess my subconscious thinks I should question even her because nothing In my life has ever worked out.Its no exaggeration to say that our house looks as bad as the house in fight club. The chimney has cracks going all up the sides. the bathroom is covered in mold that comes back every time you bleach the surfaces. The cabinets in the kitchen are dyed with a thick layer of tobacco tar if we boil water the condensation drips down the doors and leaves streaks. We scrubbed them for a whole day but it only got some of it. The carpet is stained yellow from my aunt's cat living alone in there for a few months after she died and my cousin would not come get her. Before moving in we rug doctored it and although the water was black when we were done it is still a smelly disgusting living room. There is no insulation in fact in some parts of the wall near the doors and windows you can see to the outside. Our power bill is about 270 dollars a month thanks to that. For the last two years I have been living in squaller because my parents found it convenient. My grandmother lives next door you see. And she has congestive heart failure. So it is best to have someone there. I love my grandmother so I do not mind but it does become a lot sometimes. More than I can balance with a job. My commute is an hour and the pay is garbage but I was just fired from my other job where I was a manager. I was manager for a month before a disgruntled employee who did not get that position threatened to sue the company for racism since I am white and she was black. My boss told me not to worry about it and then a week later offered an opportunity for me to step down. When I refused I got the axe. To make matters worse I cannot trust my family to help me. In fact I hate them. My father beat the shit out of me when I was a kid he even used a 2x4 on me once. My mom used that to manipulate me to do whatever she wanted because she was on my side and when I broke that off it became if I say no it means I am a bad person. Because she would only ask for things that SEEMED like they were in the best interest of others but just by coincidence she got exactly what she wanted out of the deal too.I have had conversations with them both before but they just do not register what the problem is. I can spell it out for them but nothing ever changes. I am 26 years old and my parents still control everything and every time I try to shake them they use their financial leverage to shackle me back up. Every time I get a job that pays well to start saving up I get dozens of calls a day about how my grandmother needs this or that or my sister's need something all of a sudden or she will call something on one of my accounts and if I do not do this very time consuming task I will lose my money or some shit like that. But then if I do not have a job I get the same treatment trying to force some shitty 10 dollar an hour bullshit retail job on me. And that is where I am at. If this is all life has to offer I do not want any part of it anymore. My life is not worth living.,Depression

About 78 months ago I left my abusive exgirlfriend she was my first serious partner and we were together for about a year and a half. She pretty much ruined my life and I experienced all kinds of abuse while I was with her and even when we were apart including emotional mental and physical. Fast forward to today I have a new relationship with the sweetest girl in the world a brand new start since Im a freshman in college and theres a good chance that I will never have to speak with or maybe even see my ex for a good while.,Normal

To me a loving and healthy relationship is one that can come to compromises and that are no winners or losers but agreements in place to help solve issues TOGETHER . If she has trouble with compromising on a proper solution now what will happen when it comes to or much larger life decisions like buying a house or moving to a new city.,Normal

28048,Things can happen during the course of life that are all quite normal then something happens to change our perceptions and suddenly we can remember something that previously appeared innocuous to us but with our new found perspective we can feel guilty about it. And we can feel guilty about things we have done we can feel guilty about things we didn't do but wish we had and of course we can feel guilty for nothing at all. We don't have to have done something or omitted to do something in order to feel guilty. Others can make us feel guilty through their expectations of us. Expectations can lead to disappointment and their feeling of disappointment can lead to our feeling of guilt.,Normal

It's just that I felt like I did so incredibly much and it kills me that I look back and know that over a 5 month period we only had intimate contact less than 15 times that we never made out outside sex and I initiated and was rejected many many times. Every time I brought up my frustrations regarding my unmet romantic needs she took it as gaslighting and used it as fuel to further drive the reason why she wasn't comfortable with intimate contact.,Normal

29881,Hi there I'm a 21 year old Scottish student studying contemporary art practice at an honours degree level. Is anyone interested in allowing me to use their words for use in my project for university? The consequences psychological abuse has for victims is an incredibly tricky but important subject to portray through art. I have made sure to research rather heavily on the subject of the affects of mental abuse as well as having my own personal experience with it. I will make sure to represent it with respect for everyone that has went through something similar.,Normal

28183,I am writing on behalf of my friend and colleague with his permission who has watched his daughter Laney steadily deteriorate after suddenly suffering massive strokes due to a disease known as Moya Moya which is where the body tries to compensate for inadequate bloodflow to the brain by sending capillaries that invariably burst. She is now in terminal condition and the family is facing a staggering mountain of medical bills. The icing on the cake is that the onset of the strokes occured while Laney's mom was 8 month's pregnant. The last year and a half has been horrific. I've posted the link to a GoFundMe url started by Laney's Godmother in the hopes that there may be some of you who would like to contribute.,Normal

A woman doesnt enjoy sexual play with her breasts anymore after breastfeeding because its a mammary gland and not a sex organ and the husband gets pissed because he wants to touch her breasts and apparently isnt aware of other erogenous zones. These were posts I remember reading on here for some relevant examples but I can go on.,Normal

But until then I'm considering stocking a stash of supplies at the food bank that aren't food but could be particularly useful for people before they can get into housing. The idea isn't to provide kits instead of housing but to stock items that might be occasionally useful. Most people are resourceful and provide for themselves but occasionally may be short an item or two that could make a significant difference if it were immediately available.,Normal

Also her not having a passport it use to only be a green card required to travel across the border to Canada is probably deterring that option. Thank you Reddit.,Normal

50869,Ghosting a client and stressing myself out daily Hello. So I woke up stressed again and thought I should really open up here because maybe others are going through something similar. Long story short Ive had such a hard time with finding and keeping work and part of it is because I have difficulty communicating especially when things done go as planned. Ive gotten so behind on a project that I feel frozen. The days and weeks just keep passing by and I keep avoiding talking to the client about the true status and stress keeps growing. Im afraid to even check my emails most days. I know what I need to do and I know I need to talk to the client so that I can move forward and also so that I can get paid but I really feel frozen with shame and avoidance and stress. Frozen is the best word to describe it. I hate these feelings.,Personality-disorder
50528,I'm screwed maybe many of you are too? One thing I'm aware of is after you've been disconnected from societal norms for a few years it seems very difficult to return. I tend to stay away from looking at other people's lives overall it is good but you also need an awareness of how far adrift you are and the standard you're compared against.The average person is socially active whereas were disengaged. They have a constant stream of chores hobbies events plans messaging circles. In a day some days I speak to no one and can't even find the motivation to do anything new even something like watching a movie I can put off. My point is that after a while when you look at the ''activity level'' of a normal average person I just feel inadequate. This is made worse reinforced by the fact that whenever i do try connect with others I get rejected thats because they can sense pretty early I have nothing going on for myself in these social areas and I am not so much like them. And thats the catch22 because people excluding you stops you ever having anything.I'm incapable of organising a fun life things like viewing someone in family gathering and getting along with large groups of people and creating a good impression are intimidatingnearly impossible for me. I'm behind in career life experiences life skills energy. It's just difficult to even get a footing iv been cut away for so long and many types have closed the door on me,Personality-disorder
51376,I am impressed by my ability to make girls to be mad at me It happened to me few times in my life I felt like there was a girl who was interested in me and then suddenly she became mad at me. And it was without reason maybe the reason was that she expected me to do something but I did nothing. And then suddenly her very friendly behavior changed to mad behavior and she started avoiding me.This is one of the things I am really good at other than that I am bad pretty much at anything.,Personality-disorder
51412,I rejected her even though I wanted her I made plans with a girl and we wanted to meet.I decided to cancel it and I told her that I dont feel good. Obviously she asked what is trying to get me as a some physical illness but in reality depression is trying to get me. I mean I really dont feel good I didnt lie its just not a physical illness.What I am suprised is that she instantly also said that we can meet next week. I thought she isnt interested and she is just messing with me thats also reason why I decided to cancel. I dont think that my depression will be cured until then.,Personality-disorder
51106,How did you get a therapist andor an official diagnosis? I've decided to finally take action and try and get some kind of diagnosis so I'm not just relying on my internal monologue or the internet to deal with this thing.I tried therapy once in the past with a therapist who came highly recommended and it just didn't go great. After one too many what's the worst that could actually happen? questions I just really felt like they didn't understand. This was before I had the term AVPD to explain.My question is this How did you go about working with someone who actually understands the problem?My guess is I'm being a bit too inmyhead about this but I just don't want to show up to a therapist like a hypochondriac who plugged their symptoms into WebMD and now is 100 sure of their condition. But I also get the impression AVPD isn't as common as some other personality disorders so I want to find someone who will at least have familiarity with it. But nothing shows up when I search for therapists who specialize in it directly. Are there other umbrella terms that help when finding a therapist? Should I just focus on a depressionanxiety doc or maybe one who works with other PDs like BPD? Or am I way off base and plenty of therapists will understand and just had a bad match for my first goaround?Any suggestions or anecdotes for finding the right kind of help are welcome. Thanks in advance!,Personality-disorder
51150,Phone calls are a fundamentally scary unknown way of interacting and it gives me anxiety on that basis talking to someone and only hearing a voice or getting phone calls from an unknown number is exciting and terrifying? like i already hate my voice mtf trans preop prevoiceTraining and interacting is a mess due to trauma and needing to be all these defaults that im not just to get along which isnt even true im just too afraid to be myself but i often lose that but whatever that's not the point people only want to interact in phone calls like hey there's letters theres email theres texting there are nicer ways to interact. but then again i just hate my face and voice which kinda makes both phone calls and real life really painful but at least im more used to real life despite the trauma,Personality-disorder
50878,What is it like for me having APD? For me having APD is like dying in slow motion. You just watch all these years go by one after another as you unwillingly stay alone and sabotage your relationship potential with others. It's like standing stationary on a train station platform and just watching the trains of life pass you by year after year but you are too terrified to ever get into any of the trains. Anyone else feels the same? That's how I can describe it,Personality-disorder
51342,Does anyone else ever get thoughts like I dont deserve to be walking down this hallway Im not important enough. I think this is like a generalized imposter syndrome. Typically people feel like an imposter in their field of work but this would be like that in all cases. I have a pretty underdeveloped sense of self.While were at it does anybody else constantly smile in social situations to minimize the chances of having to deal with hostility danger or stress from the other person? I just had the thought recently that this is why I smile constantly while talking to people. I recall the first time somebody asked me why I smiled all the time. I genuinely had no idea that I was smiling but that would explain why people are usually cheerful around me! Apparently this is referred to as fawning.,Personality-disorder
51531,Is anybody mainly scared of simply being perceived? Like I dont really care if they think Im dumb or even like me at this point in my life but something about knowing people see me is terrifying. Eye contact is the absolute worst because its 100 percent focus. I always try to look people in the eyes but HAVE to look away within a second otherwise I feel like theyll hate me. Im 24M and its waaaay worse with women I feel like Im invading their space just looking anywhere near them to the point I dont even know what their face looks like after an interaction.When my best friend of 10 years comes over to watch a movie I will not glance in their direction the entire time and stay on my side of the couch. But I can converse just fine and not overthink my words at all. I also feel like I have tunnel vision when im in grocery stores and if I go to a restaurant I will be stiffly hunched over my plate staring at the wall the entire time. I just realized being blind would be kinda awesome and probably take away like 90 percent of my stressors.

51543,just turned to my coworker and talked one day i've always been in awe of people who can just start talking. every time i think 'i could say this!' it's immediately dogpiled with other thoughts. the self hating ones. i don't have it in me to list them right now but if you're reading this unfortunately you probably know what i mean. anyway. i was heading out for my break on saturday and i got my marlboros out of my locker. smoking is bad i know. i bought them off a friend of a friend who stocked up on her trip to italy. so i turned to my coworker notoriously one of if not the most outgoing in our little crew and said hey check these out. and i showed him the picture of the blackened lung on the carton and we kind of joked about how fucked up it is that those kinds of health warnings are the norm in other countries but not here USA. i don't really know what was different this time. it must have been a beneficial glitch because i haven't shown that degree of spontaneity since especially not while 100 sober. it was nothing. and the self hating thoughts came right after. but once those settled a bit it was nice. thanks so much for reading i just wanted to ramble as always.,Personality-disorder
50560,how to get over fear of therapygetting help i'm 18 and have never gone to therapy or received any help and i really want to try it out but i'm so terrified of it and keep thinking things such as 'what if i misinterpret a question and answer wrong' or that i will waste their time by not being completely truthful. i very very rarely open up to anyone and when i do i have the sudden urge to cut off all contact with them which would obviously not be very useful with a therapist. i did once apply for therapy for social anxiety but cancelled the process just as i got to the last step because i convinced myself i was faking it. i want help and i don't want things to get worse but i don't know how to go about it. any advice on how to overcome this fear or services available that i should start with?i'm from the uk btw,Personality-disorder

51236,The regret of avoidance I've spent my whole life avoiding social situations that cause discomfort. I feel for me personally the end result has been not feeling a sense of fulfillment. This life is so short and we have to make the absolute best of it we can while we are able to. But I let everything fall by the wayside. I let my avoidance control me and continue to fail to accomplish anything or hold fulfilling relationships. Even if I miraculously get it under control I'll still have all of these years I spent in isolation doing nothing of value. I fear that on my deathbed I'll be alone looking back on my life in regret. Does anybody else feel this? That their time has been somewhat robbed by AvPD? I know it falls on me to make the change and that I can't play the victim but the regret is still there.,Personality-disorder

51453,My future feels so hopeless. I'm 28 years old my resume is useless haven't worked in 2 years and I am very avoidant of the world Hi there. I have been depressed since I was 12 years old. I am now 28. I also struggle with BPD social anxiety and Avoidant Personality Disorder afraid to leave the house by myself reliant on my 66 year old mother to pay my medical insurance and my husband is working full time barely keeping us afloat. I have tried and tried to work. Several different fields. Even part time. It always ended up in burn out and felt more depressed and anxious so I had to quit. I am worried I feel my future is really hopeless. I love my husband so much. We wanted to have a family and it's feeling like that won't happen because of my mental health and the low money thing. I am afraid he will abandon me because of all this though deep down really don't feel like he will because he has been here through everything.I know that is so much. That is definitely something to be grateful for. But we fight a good bit because we're both so stressed out.Nothing really brings me happiness except substances and that leads to bad feelings when it wears off or sometimes when on them and I've been mostly sober for a year.I see a therapist. I take medications. I just... I am not content in life. I am constantly worried about everything. I constantly feel like I'm worthless and my husband deserves someone more stable that he doesn't essentially have to be a caregiver to at times. I stay in bed about 70 of my days because I feel like things are so hard to do and feel so pointless.I don't have many friends and live in a small town so there aren't any meetup groups or anything. And since I don't work and am not in school no opportunities to make many friends. I do have one so I can try to branch out with her friends maybe. It feels like life is just about working. And I feel so depressed by the state of everything and by my worries that things won't improve in the future.Things don't get better. Not if you don't work for them. And I have worked I've tried so many treatments but the one thing I rarely do is go out in the world.And I don't know if I can do that without a lot of help that I don't know if I can find.Please if you can relate at all or have any advice please please respond. lt3 I'm desperate.,Personality-disorder
50583,My mom has Avoidant and dependent personality disorder and I don't know what to do. My mom is a very caring and emotional person and she's never been mean or rude in any way. However she never believes me when I say that to her. She's struggling with loving herself and believes that no one loves her and can help her. And because of that she has resorted to drinking. Because of her disorders she constantly bullies herself every day on everything she does and thinks she's the worst person alive. She's very sensitive too so one little thing can ruin her day and cause her to drink. My parents are separated but theyre both on good terms and still talk. On top of that Im struggling with myself too and I think Im stressing her out. I'm only 14 so what can I do to help her? She tried many antidepressants and other treatments but said that none works. Compliments doesnt work either since she never believes me.I always worry she's going to do something bad to herself one day.,Personality-disorder

50840,I saw someone I barely know sneakily taking a pic of me while in auditorium I'm currently in uni not doing well and today I decided to show up to a lecture a girl from my dorm who takes the same classes as me sat in front of me. I saw her subtly taking a pic where I was in the background and circle my face out on it to put the attention on me in Snapchat. I have been avoiding all dorm activities and I know everyone else have become a tight group of friends while I have been too scared to go out there and get out of my dorm room to interact with anyone for the entire semester. When I think about it it makes perfect sense that people find me weird and make fun of me. It's being the odd one out the asocial guy who doesn't show his face. I mean I don't even know the names of the people in my hallway. I can understand why they would talk about my strangness or see me as weird even be kind of disgusted by me. I am extremely akward I lack social skills I am anxious and get panic attacks emotional flashbacks when around people. I have no healthy boundaries and do not know who I am as a person have no consistent sense of self. To cope with all this I avoid all situations in which people could reject me or shame me for my insecurities lack of social skills etc. By avoiding situations I am trying to avoid getting rejected or ridiculed and deep down I know it's only normal to be frowned upon for being different or weird think about the fact that you can't help but look at someone who walks weird because of arthritis or when you come accros a homeless man lying on the side of the street. Your attention either gets caught or you try to consciously ignore it.Somehow I was still somewhat believing that I could fool the people in my dorm and hope they won't think of me as flawed insecure weird antisocial a loner etc. After seeing that I am indeed most likely a subject of ridicule mockery disgust etc to the people in my dorm I can fully drop my delusion.I have CPTSD and I developped my avoidance because of childhood emotional neglectabandonment and abuse by my narc mother. My brain is wired differently than the average person with healthy and good enough parents. I didn't have secure attachments in childhood and I am for that reason developmentally arrested. The people in my dorm don't know me and don't know about my trauma or CPTSD. They are doing what humans do pointing out the weirdness the odd one out the undesirable. It triggers people when they are confronted by something they don't understand or find weird it's normal they have their own insecurities and issues and can project all of that on the black sheep on the odd one out. If I had healthy parents good enough social skills and a fully developped and trauma free brain I would probably do the same when I encountered a weird person heck I even have judged many people for being strange undesirable or weird myself and thought I was superior to them.,Personality-disorder

My problem How do I find out if I'm completely delusional or if there might actually be something to it? If I just ask my therapist How do I know I don't have AvPD? it may come across as extremely knowitall and pushy. Aside from that I have many questions and concerns what if I was misdiagnosed because I misdescribed my problems?I'm really sorry to write in this subreddit.

50733,I need to get better I am scared because I had to do something today but postponed it to tomorrow. Planning to wake up at 4am to do it but it's 12pm already. I had to send an email to a coworker explaining how far i reached in solving an issue so they can take over but i have made 0 progress in it even though i took 2 fucking weeks for it. I also can't say that i didn't make any progress because i told my boss otherwise. I just don't start my work itself because I am too scared to encounter new issues that i won't be able to solve. Procrastination is fucking me up. I don't even know what or why I am typing. I feel i just keep feeling sorry for myself and don't really do much to improve.Anyways I am preparing side by side for a career shift but i dont see how it would be much better as the issue mainly lies with me and everyone in my job are great people. I just think way to hard on how to appear a certain way to others because I base my self worth on others opinion of me which I am trying to change but honestly don't see it getting much better.I went to different psycologists and psychiatrists in the past but never sticked to any. My mind kept finding reasons to not continue even tho some of the meds helped me at the time. I will probably go to a therapist again. Thank you if you read so far. I need friends who can understand my situation and want to get better too. Any resources links or advices you can offer for my situation are most welcome thank you again.,Personality-disorder
50668,AvPD can be avoiding woman only? I wonder if avoiding woman can be AvPD? I have avoided woman almost my whole life at some point in high school I liked a girl I talked to a bit. But never full got to know her because of paranoia of not having a car or being able to provide for her in any way. Its probably the only time I spoke with a girl. Mainly because I was invested in wanting to be with he but was to afraid to be with her in a relationship.If AvPD is not only avoiding woman for my instance then I dont understand AvPD.,Personality-disorder

And I cant explain why but every time someone says that to me or even pokes fun at me for it I have to hold back tears and just smile or lightly laugh it off. I dont even know what to say when someone says that and it makes me feel even worse. I would even go as far as to say it ruins my day because my brain just fixates on that and tells me theres something wrong with me over and over and its all I can think about. I hate it.

50628,Just wonder if people have heard of hypersensitivity. Im a Highly Sensitive Person or HSP but I realized I was being super sensitive for awhile now. I think this is when I started to realize my AvPD. I was talking to my former therapist a couple of months back and she told me about it. Her friend had become disabled and was being hypersensitive. I think a lot of this comes from trauma. Also doesnt help when people arent really compassionate in general. I dont really have much advice but try to heal from traumas.

51063,What should I do if I strongly suspect AvPD? I've struggled with mentalemotional problems pretty much all my life. Even as a young kid I was very shy and anxious. That morphed into more severe problems as I became a teenyoung adult.Now at almost 30 I'm really frustrated because nothing gets better for me. Doctors keep trying to treat me for depression or anxiety or ADHD which I do have problems with but it seems like there are more fundamental deeply set issues which go unaddressed. I've been interested in psychology since I was a teen and there have been times where I've considered that I might have AvPD before forgetting about it but recently I began researching this in earnest and pretty much every diagnostic criterion strongly fits me. It's kind of scary how well it describes me and how much the posts in this sub reflect my thoughts amp experiences.Where should I go from here? How can I bring this up with my psych or should I bring it up? Would getting a diagnosis be worth it?,Personality-disorder

51071,Does anyone know if AVPD would qualify for MAID in Canada when it opens to Mental Health conditions? In March Medical assistance in dying is opening up for people with conditions causing unbearable pain physical or mental they do not have to life threatening. httpswww.ontario.capagemedicalassistancedyingandendlifedecisionshttpswww.ontario.capagemedicalassistancedyingandendlifedecisionsI've gone over this at least a hundred times like tonight even if I get approved they have a new 90 day minimum waiting period so it will be a while regardless. I have to time to think which leads to all fun ideas of Wiley coyote jumping off my balcony and hitting the concrete awning over the front entrance 12 stories might kill ol' Wiley maybe or leave him in agonizing pain wishing for death. Imagine holding that little sign up to the camera but it's a little suicide note saying goodbye to no one. HahaBut I'm pretty confident I'm going to get approved I meet very criteria I've tried all the required mental health options counselling therapy community services etc. I don't have any psychological supports I am alone. That's more than half the reason I want to go this condition this brain it makes it so I will always be alone. The loneliness knowing you can never and never will escape you'll avoid every chance you have. But the pain doesn't have to be forever I don't have to keep suffering and if I don't get approved jokes on them. I don't need approval to kill myself I just know I'm going to fuck it up anyway. Ending up with my ankles snapped off trying to crack my skull open on the concrete but too fucking weak to get the pressure. I couldn't do it if I tried not because I don't want too. I want too I want too so bad that's why I'm applying for Maid but I need to do it. But I will fail because I always fail. I'll avoid because i always avoid. I'll pity myself and feel bad and get fucked up and cry and hurt myself and tomorrow will happen and my credit card will get more maxed out and death will come knocking again saying TODAY IS THE DAY DO IT DO IT FUCKING DO IT PLEASE DO IT. Constantly. That's my brain thousands of times a day screaming kill yourself. I love saying slit your wrists over and over again. Making tea I should slip my fucking wrists dum dum dum please slit your wrists. I don't even have a good knife I just say it for some reason to myself. I'm way less scared of cutting that jumping I am terrified of fucking that up. Damn Hamilton's and our slow trains lmao. That was the way I wanted to go when I was trying to do it as a teenager. The trains back home damn they were fast knock your fucking head off in one go. Instant. There were always Roses taped to the Red sign beside the opening. A lot of people had the same idea as me so at least you know it works right!But you can always fuck it up the fear that causes avoidance affects suicide too!

51334,Low EQ Parents I always knew that my dad was low EQ.But my biggest epiphany was realizing that even my mom is low EQ.You always think that because women tend to express their emotions so readily that they're high in EQ.BUT beware THAT IS NOT THE CASE.Emotional Expressiveness IS NOT THE SAME AS Emotional Intelligence!,Personality-disorder
51094,Anyone else sensitive to tone of voice I swear Id be having a good day but if I ever feel like someones tone of voice is even slightly harsh it ruins the vibe for the whole day. This could be anybody random like the front desk or customer representative. They dont necessarily say anything mean but their voice is choppy in response to my effort of trying to be animated and kind I know its not a big deal AT ALL and it might just be in my head nothing personal. But my brain is just mean I guess. I subconsciously take everything personally and its really starting to harm me well at least I recognized this pattern. I wish I could be as cold and distant as I appear on the outside. I envy people who are very level headed,Personality-disorder
50854,Noticing negative behaviours while talking to someone I quickly notice negative behaviours when i talk to people.

51065,Feeling like a creep in publicon public transport So I've had this for a long time but only now have I sort of grasped why I feel like this.Whenever I'm outside and especially in closed off public transport like the subway I'll feel like a creep because I just stare and analyze everyone and everything. The reality is that when I get anxious I get hyperaware of everything and everyone around me and when I start starting at strangers analyzing every bit of their appearanceclothingpostureetc I start feeling like a creep. Only recently have I realized that the being hyperaware is where the feeling of being a creep comes from vs just organically. With me being less anxious lately I'm more able to just stare off into the distance and distract myself with my thoughts and then suddenly I don't feel so inadequateweird anymore.I know I've thought about this before and even said it to someone that when my anxiety takes over I literally can't think of anything but the present situation. I'll literally start brainstorming ideas to think about so I can distract myself from what's in my face that second.Just felt like typing this out and sharing maybe someone can relate.Much love,Personality-disorder
51572,Societal Standards Not sure if this is just me but the more I self reflect the more i realize that im unhealthily antisocial but ok with that until i feel societal pressure to be different. Ive always been a loner and i can be like that ALL the time but the only time i feel shameful of that is when im around other people who arent like that and find it weird. Its almost like one part of me desires companionship and being more friendly because thats what you need for a happy life apparently but putting myself out there never satisfies me. Having friends just stresses me out and makes me deeply insecure theres literally no satisfaction I get from it. I guess Im deeply unhealthy but I love to isolate and cant relate to others and feel insecure about it like I wish I could be in the standard of whats normal but Im also really addicted to unhealthy habits. Do I sound crazy its hard to put into words how I feel but its like Im so closed off and avoidant around people and get stressed about societal pressures but am ok with my unhealthy isolation until I realize other people dont live their lives like that. I dont want to miss out but find it hard to change. I guess my behavior isnt normal but trying to fit in just makes my anxiety so bad. Hopefully somebody understands what I mean. I think this is just how it is when your mentality ill for a long period of time.,Personality-disorder
51514,Need to vent. I have had a partner for 4 years. Its a shock to me as well. But we havent had the greatest past. To make a very long story short When he started medical school 4 years ago when we first started dating he wasnt that nice to me. Some might say he was abusive towards me especially when he drank. Anyway he used my avoidant personality as leverage to skew many details regarding our relationship. It turned everyone in his life against me.Now my partner has sobered up. It took me a while to trust and accept this change. But the people in his life still havent let go of the past. And the truth is neither have I. Ive forgiven my partner but I havent forgotten how everyone else treated me even after my partner tried to clear my name. It only augmented the characteristics of my AVPD. It dissuaded me from applying to grad school seek any professional or academic opportunities but mainly it left me with an intense fear of leaving my house because I simply dont trust anyone anymore. Today my partner found out where he matched for residency. His school hosted a luncheon that celebrated the students who matched. So my partner invited me and his parents and his friends were already there since theyre in the same class. Keep in mind that I havent seen anyone in about 23 years. After panicking for a week before the event I finally mustered up the courage to go. I convinced myself its not going to be bad. My partner actually reassured me a lot as well. Well.Aside from my partner everyone acted like I was invisible. They went out of their way to hug and greet everyone and then skipped right over me. Even when I spoke they wouldnt acknowledge me. My partner was really disappointed in them but wanted to keep the mood light so he didnt confront anyone. He did stick by my side so I was at least grateful for that. It all just augmented my social anxiety avoidant personality and even my body dysmorphia. Looking at the pictures I took of everyone else versus the photos they took of me. Im really struggling to decide if its just a bad day or if Im really that hideous. It makes me never want to step foot outside again. My partner truly has turned his life around and has become more aware of my needs. I love him very much and am proud that hes grown up a lot during our relationship. Yes ideally we wouldve never had to go through our dark phase. But hes helped me in many ways too. I just wish the people in his life were nicer to me. They have no idea what their rejection does to me.,Personality-disorder
50778,I moved out. A friend of mine was talking to me about my family situation and I told him about how I wanted to put distance between me and them. He said that he might have some ideas and that we could work something out.I've been in a new place now for five days. I have a roommate he is cool. His work keeps me from seeing him very much so I only have to deal with other people in small doses. The best thing is that I'm finally away from my relatives! It always feels weird when I say I miss you too over the phone because I don't miss them at all. I'm so happy to finally be freed of them!People do keep telling me that it's natural for me to feel this way and that I'll miss them eventually but I don't want to miss them. I had to go back earlier today to pick up some of my stuff but I dreaded seeing anyone there. I left as soon as I could and I guess I just don't know how to feel now. I still love them I never didn't love my relatives but I know they're not good for me. I am much better on my own. I guess I just feel guilty like I owe them something. Part of me wants to go back and try to fix them but I have to keep reminding myself that I can't do that and that they're not my responsibility. So I'm determined to not go back for as long as possible. The only reason I'd go back now is to get my bike but I can be without that for a while. Otherwise I'm done belonging to them. I am my own person now and I'm slowly getting to like who I'm becoming.I definitely still have many times where I hate myself for messing something up or blaming myself for something that can't be helped or just wasn't my fault. But overall things are getting better and me leaving my relatives behind is just one of many steps in the right direction.,Personality-disorder

51169,I don't know why I'm so selfdefeating. I can't help it. I don't avoid people because I'm anxious or embarrassed or ugly or feel unwanted. People try to make connections with me and I shut them down or ghost them. I just refuse the effort. And it's not because it's unwantedI wish I had friends I want to date I imagine what my life would be like if I wasn't me and it looks like a lot of fun. I don't think I'm actually schizoid or anything. I just don't have the drive to improve my life in the ways I know I should.I have never been in a relationship but I have accounts on a couple different dating apps. I put effort into my profiles and then I ignore every message I get. When people try to talk to me in public I usually just walk away. I don't know why. Engaging at all just doesn't seem possible. It feels like writer's block only it's going to ruin my life.It's not like I had a traumatic childhood or anything. I wasn't abused. My parents weren't narcissists. I wasn't even particularly unpopular in school but even back then even in elementary school I would refuse any efforts to hang out outside the classroom. I would never go over to my friend's houses even though my mom always said yes. Most often I wouldn't even tell her I was invited. And then I would feel sad from the isolation lol.I don't really know what the point of this post is. It's more of a rambling vent than anything else. I need to get it off my chest somehow. My family is so confused by my behavior but I can't bring myself to talk to them about it. Somehow it's easier on an anonymous subreddit. I'm not even sure if this is allowed here since I'm not officially diagnosed. When I was 19 I went to a psychiatrist to get treatment for my OCD. I didn't want to but the only other option was killing myself which I wanted to do less. He's the one who brought AvPD to my attention but he didn't give me a diagnosis that day. He wanted me to come back for follow up appointments to narrow things down. I refused. I don't know why.,Personality-disorder
50586,Anyone else from a minority community nationality ethnic group religion or race and feel like an outcast everywhere? Apart from moving many times during childhood and teenage years I have one parent who was Jewish and one who was HispanicPuerto Rican. They divorced when I was young Stevie Wonder could see that one coming and as a result I never felt like I belonged with any community. I never learned Spanish never really learned all that much about being Jewish or Puerto Rican my mother was Americanized except the basic stuff. I was also too isolated to feel like a belonged to the average American culture in general and never really picked up on all the popculture that went along with it. I've always felt like an outcast and outsider partly because of this. Although at the same time I feel like I'm a failurecoward because I see many people who are part of a minority group who are able to handle themselves just fine and I'm white on top of that so I didn't really have it that hard. You can tell I may be Jewish because of some of my facial features lol and I was sometimes teased and bullied in schoolwork because of it but it's never been as bad as someone who is for example dark skinned in a western country and has a foreign accent. Even then I feel people like that had their own community to fall back to though and I feel lost almost. Idk forgive my rambling...

51171,The urge to disappear and start over. First I want to say that I am not diagnosed. I've seen quite a lot of posts about this urge to disappear on rSchizoidhttpswww.reddit.comrSchizoid and also rAvPDhttpswww.reddit.comrAvPD.I am kind of glad that I am not the only one who does this. I constantly delete my social media and start over. By doing this I also ghost all of my friends on Discord. With social media like Reddit Twitch and others creating new accounts isn't a problem for me because I don't post anything. I only keep my Steam account. I always knew it's not normal. I didn't know other people also struggle with this.My friends are annoyed whenever I come up with a new Discord account. I really don't want to talk to them about this. It's hard for me to talk about my feelings with people I know. I feel like they wouldn't understand me andor would judge me. Most of my friends I've known since 2017. I usually just come up with a dumb excuse like I forgot my password or something like that.I want to explain the weird urge I get whenever I feel like disappearing. Under a post there was this commentgtThere was a point where I realized I was getting very good at starting things because after a certain point I would get that urge to restart. Not just with accounts but with everything. I'd plan out how I was going to use an account build a new habit accomplish some goal as efficiently and optimally as possible and for a while follow through. Eventually I would drift off track a little let it eat at me and then give up and decide I'll start over and do it better. At this point I struggle to get to the I'm going to try stage and usually just don't bother. The apathy does help me push through failure or perceived shortcomings a little more.This comment describes my situation very accurately. I feel almost exactly as this guy.Creating new accounts has become a routine. I feel like it even calms me and is the closest thing to running away from everything. It's kind of hard to explain how I feel..I ghosted my friends like 3 weeks ago. Throughout the weeks I've tried to start over but I always fail and just start over once again.. I didn't tell anyone I'll disappear. I deleted my Discord and now I'm gone. My friend texted me on Snapchat asking why I deleted my account. I just responded with something like yeah lol. Didn't even give an answer. Ever since then I haven't talked to them. I want to but I know I'm gonna disappear after a month. I also don't want to explain to them why I deleted my account because I can't even do it right now where I am anonymous.Probably a lot of mistakes very unorganized post but yeah.. I hate this. I just want to be normal. ,Personality-disorder

50706,Id rather be alone than feel like this Went on a date a week ago for the first time in years. Normally I am not attracted to people but this time I felt super attracted to this person. Good talks and the whole day we spent together. We had sex but I did not sleep at that persons place bc thats too intimate for me I see sex a something purely physical but sleeping is too scary for me. However that person didnt text me for a week so I texted to ask to go to a concert with a mutual friend. Still no response for 2 days. I feel so insecure and rejected and it confirms the negative view I already have about myself. I really would like to have a relationship and fall in love but even dating makes me feel so worthless ugly stupid and anxious even after one date. Sorry for the vent but this is the only place I feel I can share this. Other people say that I just need to relax stop overreacting and stop being insecure and blablabla. Thats why I never share these feelings with people,Personality-disorder
51565,Is there anyone else here who checks off all of the boxes for AvPD but cant ever get officially diagnosed with it because your case just isnt bad enough? Im fairly certain I have avpd and have had so for the majority of my life. Like I have almost all of the symptoms down the the horrible childhood trauma that I experienced that started my downfall. Avpd is the only condition that Ive been able to match up to down to a tee. Ive went to therapy and discussed my issues but it doesnt seem like avpd is something I can ever officially get diagnosed with.While Im fairly certain I have avpd my case is more mild because it doesnt completely shut down my life. I would consider myself with high functioning avpd. Since I was young Ive always been lonely and had to figure out life out on my own since I didnt have my parents or a loving family to grow up with. As a result out of necessity I had to be financially independent and look after myself. Working and going to college was a never an issue for me. Because of that Ive been able to give myself a good career and more or less have an ok life. My avpd is most severe in my personal daily life away from work. Its a daily struggle for me. I also match all of the social symptoms of avpd and live a life of loneliness because I cant get myself out to meet people regularly. Can anyone else relate?,Personality-disorder
51502,I recovered from AvPD. What will help others? I dont believe in matters of mental health ever truly being 100 cured.Even though I still have some AvPD traits that Im still working on my therapist says I certainly no longer meet the diagnosis of AvPD.Ive gone from being a textbook AvPD with such bad social anxiety I barely left the house an could barely order a cheeseburger.All through school people called me socially retarded and my mom thought I was autistic.To now being a very socially skilled confident outgoing person who makes friends easily.Im curious if people are interested in some kind of a write up about how Ive recovered from my AvPD what helped me how long it can take etc?I see a lot of people struggling and feeling hopeless on this board.It breaks my heart when I see people truly believe that recovery is impossible and spreading that false message. It is possible! Its just really hard uncomfortable takes a lot of time and you have to really want it.Thoughts on whether a write up is something people would be receptive of? Im also open to suggestions of what else could help.P.S. I feel vulnerable writing this post in fear that people will have an angry skeptical reaction or think Im being narcissistic. But I wanted to take the risk and reach out anyway because Im super passionate about recovery and Id love to see the negative narrative about AvPD recovery start to change.,Personality-disorder
50871,harmless situations cause embarrassment and shame i dont understand why such minor situations cause me so much embarrassment and shame. i just asked to sign up for something and i was told i cant until tomorrow and now im hating myself and wishing id never leave my house or socialize. thats something that would mean nothing to other people and yet it makes me feel nauseous. i really hope these symptoms can get better because i dont know how i could live the rest of my life this way. im tired of feeling constant shame and embarrassment when im in public and within social situations that leave me feeling suicidal when its never a big deal to anyone else. i hate how sensitive i am especially to silly things. does anyone else feel this way?,Personality-disorder
51299,First real date We walked in the park for like an entire day then the next day watched a movie. We kissed which was my first time doing that cool. But it turned out she wasn't as into me as I was her. So its over all for the best. I'm feeling so positive about it. It was painful for the first couple days after no lie but now I feel great.I was so worried that I wouldn't be able to make a move sexually but I did it. It was awkward as hell obviously but I did it. I was bold as fuck. And it was really no big deal. I saw her again the other day and it was totally cool no hard feelings.I finally feel like a real living human being. It's like I've been set free in a major way. Only a year after I asked out the first person haha. Feels like a lifetime ago. I never thought I'd actually get here and I'm so grateful that I did. And I have so much time ahead of me. I'm only 24. I used to look at the future and see only dread and misery but now I see hope and promise. Thank you thank you,Personality-disorder
50548,Dating apps even harder with AvPD Disclaimer I dislike dating app culture in general. There's a hell of a lot more to a person than a few pictures and prompts.If I'm not attracted to someone then I won't swipe on them. If I am attracted to someone and there's even one thing on their profile that I lack or don't relate to then I won't swipe on them either. If there's someone I'm attracted to and there's nothing problematic in their profile I won't swipe on them because I doubt they'll be interested in me. In the end this leaves a very very small pool of people which I guess makes the whole thing pointless?,Personality-disorder

I have a deep sense of shame about this and I finally feel like I want to come out and like be a person again. But the thought of meeting new people who didn't waste years in isolation makes me queasy. Making friends when you have none just feels downright embarrassing. Reconnecting with people I lost touch with years ago due to this lovely PD is also mortifying. Sorry I stopped talking to you I took a break from being a person for a few years isn't really something I feel comfortable admitting. How do I explain myself without scaring off everyone? What if I do engage with the world again have a good thing going for a while and then just shut down again only this time with a new batch of people to disappoint when I inevitably ghost them.

51279,Honestly do you think the label AvPD does you more harm than good? TLDR My therapist says labels might be helpfulempowering for some but might have a negative effect on others. Theres debates about this in the mental health community. It is in fact harmful for me so I have decided to stop seeking diagnosis for now.Recently my therapist told me how mental health labels might help some but have a negative effect on some.This discussion started when I requested a written diagnosis from her.In my case after discussing labels with her I was able to come to the conclusion that I tend to dehumanise myself because of the label.I treat myself as diseased or nuisance and often feel bad for not being as good as normal people.Theres a whole debate even in the mental health community about labels and how sometimes mental health professionals might misuse it.So for now Ive stopped seeking out a diagnosis.

I don't exactly know how to feel about it it makes sense all too much sense. I wonder if I could've turned out better if I had been diagnosed earlier since I've basically wasted my entire life so far. Only good part was some part of my 09'th grade since it was a private school that had good experience with a bit different kids not a specialschool but nevertheless a good school for me.ampx200BWell looking forward at least I have this diagnosis now and I have somewhere to start from. I'll be looking to get my doctor's reference to a psychologist to hopefully make some progress with all of this. Even though I'm a complete hermit who is not at all good at getting daily things done I do have at least a bit of hope of turning some things around I still have hope that I can make progress for the better. But it's going to be hard.ampx200BI wish you all the best as well from the bottom of my heart.,Personality-disorder
50993,Feel like I'm too far gone I'll try to keep this brief as I tend to ramble on about how much I pity myself. I just feel like no matter how much work I put in it will never be enough. I have been getting out of my comfort zone lately and putting myself into more social situations but the more I do it the more disillusioned I become. I think that even if the fear and anxiety I feel with socializing was removed I'd still only ever be able to interact on a superficial level. It's like a fundamental part of me is missing. It feels like the best I can ever hope for is to function in society at a basic level. Sorry to be a melodramatic downer. I'm just feeling really low today and wanted to put my thoughts out there. Maybe someone can relate. Thanks for listening.,Personality-disorder
50678,How to not hurt peoples feelings I think Im doing better at socializing than before but after a big socialization day I get so worn out from all the effort it takes that I need a recovery day where I literally dont interact with anyone or else I start shutting down. However society does not work on my schedule and so obviously I cant always have a recovery. When Im socially overwhelmed I tend to give short answers and seem super aloof disinterested monotone etc. sometimes people take this personally even though it has nothing to do with them Im just worn out.Usually with strangers it doesnt matter that much because Ill never meet them again but with my friends or partner it can be hard. They obviously care about me and start asking are you mad at me? Am I annoying? Etc. and that kind of stuff is really irritating because it requires some level of delicacy by saying you as a person are not annoying but Im just really irritated right now for reasons other than you and you are exacerbating it. But it is not your fault and theres no reason you wouldve known this Like I wish I could just say that but literally nothing comes out of my mouth. I cant manage anything other than a tiny whimper of a no because I at least want to preserve their feelings. My partner especially gets insecure and frequently asks me are you mad at me do you hate me am I annoying somewhat in jest but also to an extent its a reflection of real insecurities I know she has told me about. I cant handle navigating those questions when Im socially overstimulated but I dont want to make her insecure worse either. I know a relationship is a two way street but I always feel like a burden for my emotions and needs Any advice?,Personality-disorder

50537,How can I function with unwanted thoughts that don't go away? I am 22 years old and male. I was diagnosed when I was 18. I've also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I live with my parents and I am NEET. I did not go to college. I've spent the majority of my childhood and adolescence getting some kind of therapy andor psychiatric help but I stopped about a year ago because I realized it was not going to help me. I have very low energy and fleeting motivation and day to day I can't consistently do the basic tasks of caring for myself and maintaining my living space in other words living like an actual adult. The main reason these things are so hard for me is that when I'm doing chores and things where my mind can wander I keep thinking about things I don't want to think about. I remember in detail the moments when people have insulted me or been cruel to me or times when I've embarassed myself or made a mistake for years and I relive them constantly and the wounds are continuously reopened and never heal. I often freeze up when these thoughts strike me and sometimes it makes me curse or say things out loud when I know I'm alone. Sometimes these thoughts can be powerful enough to ruin a good mood and ruin my day. It can make completing simple tasks so painful that I avoid them entirely and my quality of life suffers greatly and it affects the people that I live with. I spend almost all of my time constantly trying to distract myself and escape from these thoughts. Can anyone relate? How can I function like this?,Personality-disorder

I just try my best to be patient and there for him when he is ready to reconnect.I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how I could support him and possibly ease any suffering he may be going through. I love him beyond words but I dont want to cause anymore discomfort than he may already be going through.Thanks heaps everyone,Personality-disorder

51152,Going at your own pace I believe some days ago there was a post about being tired of importance of communication skills in life. Now there's kinda similar issue but with the pace that everything's is going with. Just my personal experience I am not speaking for everyone. So last year I quit college cus I couldn't bear stress and deadlines. I was pretty slow to understand and do things that was required professors or whatever they're called sry not sure were pressuring us a lot with all that and so on. I have a job as a stocker now but in about month or so I have to think about other options for studying collegesuniversities just some other field and that honestly makes my stomach twist. It's not about what I want it's about how it'll all go. I'd love to spend my time studying art but I am so afraid of the process. When I think about it I can imagine only flaws and mistakes I'd make. There would be so much things to learn and practice but so little time to do all that. And now to the title. I hate that everything must be spinning crazy like that. If you want to study you must be catching up quickly otherwise it's immediately your one big ass problem and no one is willing to help you with that. It'd so damn cool if there was any way to get education on your own pace so you have enough time for everything. I know it's only in my dreams but I can't stop thinking about it. I am so slow because my brain is so fried after all these years fighting this plague. I don't know maybe it's just me and I am that broken but it's really so sad that I can't normally go towards my dreams. And those fears aren't even irrational same shit happened year ago and I know myself so damn well it couldn't be any way around. Sorry for such long bullshit vent I had to get it off my chest,Personality-disorder
50976,Don't want to live like this I'm bullied and treated like I'm subhuman everywhere I go. I don't think it'd be possible for me to improve myself and change how I am. I'm subhuman and that's not going to change anytime soon. I think about suicide everyday and I hate myself beyond measure.,Personality-disorder
50885,Feeling I don't belong When I'm alone or doing my own thing I don't feel alone so much. I'm used to being alone and doing my own thing and here and there I communicate with people. That's okay. But when I'm suppised to be part of a group I start to feel inferior to others and that I don't belong. Everyone else is interacting with each other but somehow I am left outside the group. The school and Uni were propably the worst because you are alone amongst everybody else everyday. In my current work everything is okay because I work from home and I don't see the others interacting all the time. I just pretend that everyone else is doing their work alone same as me. But. Now we have this group work at my work and now I feel alone again. We should be interacting with each other but I'm not interacting with anyone. In meetings I hear how everyone else has been working with each other except for me.. Group work makes me feel so alone ,Personality-disorder
50797,So.. what now? How do I continue my life. I very recently got diagnosed 4 days ago with AvPD after years and years and years of thinking that I just have very stubborn type of social phobiasocial anxiety. I met with a specialist who really dug through my health records and diagnoses and even read through the psycological evaluation tests I went through over an year ago several times. She was very firm and sure that I indeed have this disorder instead of the one I've been getting treatment on and it all stems from me hard schoollife I had to go through. But instead my home life was always good very loving and caring parents and I love them so so much. They made sure me and my brother always had food clean clothes and a warm home to live in we were poor but still happy.My self esteem and self worth got destroyed from very young age by other kids it's also very hard to trust people I'm worthless and like a ghost to others at times. Without digging deeper to the trauma I've faced in school I've just been existing and surviving from the young age to the 30's. I'm 33 still very broken unemployed depressed too but I go to therapy and have medication. I've medicated myself with alcohol earlier years but stopped when I started antidepressants I still do self harm too as a coping mechanism which I'm not proud at all. I very much hate and regret that I ever started dabbling to that habit in my young days. Is there really something good about this personality disorder? Can I ever learn to live with it in the way it won't make me isolate myself from others and fear other people? I don't know. I have a lot of doubts even when I am in a treatment and path to somekind of recovery. Is it even possible to meet new people and form a romantic relationship too? Yes I'm single been for the last 10 years and sometimes it's eating me from the inside to the point I feel physical pain. I crave human touch nonsexual and sexual and sometimes I'm at the point that even a single friendly hug would make me cry. Yes I am lonely. Luckily I have a small friend group very small and two closest people out of this group are a couple so naturally they don't always have time for friends. Which I naturally understand they have their own things and struggles too. It's just life. When I told two other friends about this new diagnosis I got they do know about my mental health struggles well... they just were very silent and one of them answered with 23 words in the way of oh I see and that's all. It did kinda hurt does that make me a badattention seeking person? For wanting even just a little bit of undersanding what's causing me to behave some way I don't always even realise I'm doing it?Heck this is kinda one messy message but I just have so many things going in my head now and I don't have any answers to give for myself. I've always wanted to solve problems by myself but this is just too big of a thing for my brain to fully understand. And I almost deleted this text and didn't want to post. I'm sorry if I sound all whiny I just have so many questions and I'm sure there could be even more of them. I'm not even sure if the flair is correct.,Personality-disorder
50741,I wish I could thank every person that has shown me kindness Theres a lot of people that have been nice to me. People Ive worked or went to school with that would talk to me or smile at me I wish I could thank them for being caring and generous enough to acknowledge me most people ignore me which I dont mind and some people bully me. But I often think about the people that went out there way to be nice to me they would have got noting out of it they did it just to be nice maybe they could see I was shy and lonely and had pity for me so they would talk or smile or say good morning to me to make me feel like a human being even though people pitying me makes me feel embarrassed and small I appreciate it so much but Im never able to show it so I just pray for them every day and hope they are having amazing lives and I hope they know they are angels.,Personality-disorder
50802,My brain just goes blank even if I want to engage I don't know if this is an AvPD thing or not but does anybody else here mostly don't speak as much during conversations because your brain just goes completely blank? I frequently find myself at conversations most of them tbh where I want to talk and engage but I just don't know what to respond at all. I catch myself saying a lot of mmm yeah it's true I agree but not something... substancial you know? Sometimes I even repeat words just to use more time like yeah yeah.Meanwhile when I observe the way other people talk is like they always have something to say some comment to make or something to keep the conversation going and it seems so natural for them. I always get afraid that people will like other people more because they can offer more during a conversation than I can and honestly I think this has been proven true over time.Some time ago I created a personal system to help me fill up silences and some of the things I set myself to do at these moments where 1. just think out loud without filtering so much I read somewhere that one of the differences between extroverts and introverts is that the first ones sometimes think with their mouths while introverts think first then decide if it's worth sharing and for us with AvPD andor SAD we mostly decide it is not and 2. look for a subject connection even if it's minimal then be like this reminds me of... and keep going about it.When I observe other people interacting I can see them using these a lot naturally I feel like a robot because I had to sit down and actually think to came up with these and have to make an effort to put them in practice but even with this system I'm still having problems because like I said a lot of times I simply can't think of anything. I don't know if this is some kind of freeze response to the danger of socialization or if my brain is just socially dumb lol.,Personality-disorder
50640,Feeling disconnected from peers how do I stand out to fit in? Hi I've been struggling a lot in school from even before college and lonely for most of my life. I've been the odd one out since back when and slow on socialising I can't seem to use social media well too afraid that my relatives will find it andor hold conversations for very long even though I find people with the same interests. I've gotten responses that range from implying that I annoy them or getting told my way of thinking is... strange? I'm not sure how to phrase this since I tend to notice my ideas get shot down and nitpicked more than others in my friend group or even project team setting. I started withdrawing from my social circles as a result and getting used to living alone with myself. My family been supportive of me thus far and I shouldnt complain but I cant live like this for very long I want to express myself and find a space for my art craft and ideas that accepts me for me.And I'm sure in order to be independent I need to also be comfortable with myself.But I'm not. I live life now never crossing the line with people even if I think its a terrible idea and is proven to be for the purpose of avoiding conflict I withhold my ideas so as to not seem radical or stupid and avoid being berated or talked down. I feel like a NPC living a scripted life.How do we overcome this and have the courage to live for us? Can I do it in a way to eliminate these stresses? Or is avoiding them the main issue?,Personality-disorder
50888,It's getting harder to pretend I'll be okay My birthday was last month. I turned 26. I went to a buffet with my mom because she was the only one who remembered. It was nice but the whole time I also had this cold dread in my stomach because this is my life that this is going to be my life forever. And a month out the dread is still here. It's hard to breathe sometimes when I think about how I'm closer to 30 now than to 20 over a quarter of the way through my life by any metric and I have nothing at all to show for it. I still haven't met basic milestones others do in their teens. And I don't see myself meeting them anytime soon. I never learned how to drive. I've never lived on my own. I've never held a job for longer than a year. I've never had a friend let alone a romantic attachment. Most of my hometown is a mystery to me because I've never gone anywhere or experienced anything. And at this point the idea of trying to fix what's wrong is scarier than just rotting away on my own.Sorry for the melodrama. Point being I'm not in a great place right now and it's just getting worse over time. And I can't talk to anyone about it because I don't know anyone except my mom and she really doesn't understand why I can't just force it. To be fair I don't understand either. Thanks for reading and have a good day.,Personality-disorder
50719,my guinea pig passed and now there's just me i dont know if my flair is correct? idk. last night around 2 am she passed. my sweet lilith. i had her for a good 7 years and she was a darling so sweet and kind jumpy and squeaky all up until the last couple days where she suddenly became so tired. her last day came around and i just felt it. she was so exhausted. i tried to get her into my local vet yesterday but they said they didnt have time for her that day? so we stuck it out hoping i would get her in today but. there wasnt time. i gave her as much water as she would take before she passed tried to feed her and mostly just. talked to her and praised her and loved her. i held her all night. she hadnt eaten in a day already aside from the very few nibbles she'd taken from what i tried to give her. tomato was her favorite food so i brought her some tomato last night as she was on her last leg. it was her last treat. i was surprised she came running for it despite her exhaustion and she had a little nibble. just a little. i wanted her to have more but she was so tired and im glad she had even that. everything seemed so much for her. she snuggled with me in some of her last moments before i tucked her back in her cage where she felt safest. and she passed. i have friends but not very close ones anymore as ive isolated myself so much. i feel very very alone and i dont know if there's anything else for me here. i think there's probably not. im so so tired and im ready to give up. my parents are going away for the weekend and with the way things are lining up i wonder if now is the time. i guess im just posting this to vent or maybe to have someone for a little bit or maybe a call for help or something. i dont know. but im so tired and sad and afraid and alone and im so over it all. i want it to end so badly and. idk. im sorry i really am i just want it all to end. i want it to be over so badly.,Personality-disorder
51088,hi HiI'll start by saying I've been diagnosed with AvPD about 2 years ago around the end of my military service but it's something I've dealt with most of my teen life unknowingly and now as a 22 years old still. I'm seeing a therapist for the better part of 2 years now and it helps mainly mentally not physically yet as I'm not doing much spending all my days at home no friends no social life no nothing. I did get a job last week which I'm starting next week 4 hours a day cleaning some school buildings 5 minutes from my house.But as the time goes I find myself daydreaming more and more about stuff I'd like to do like traveling the world and studying I even got as far as signing up to university but ended up canceling it like 3 days before the semester started. Since then I'm daydreaming about traveling going to south america or something..Last week I said screw it and booked a ticket to Barcelona for a trip with my mom and sister. I was very excited as I'm a big FC Barcelona fan for years but as we all know something has to go wrong. We're supposed to fly tomorrow and man this has been one of the worst days I had in the last couple of years. I feel like I just wanna disappear until Friday arrives when the trip is over. I feel like it's a task someone is commanding me to finish and not something I ever wanted to do. It took me some time cause I usually keep to myself but shared it with my mom and sister and now they're thinking whether they should cancel or go and they're waiting for my desicion. I also cried talking to my mom and told her many things that she didn't know like how I don't talk to my 2 friends anymore or how before I got this poor job I was sending CV's and when people would call me I couldn't pick up the phone. I told her that I feel lonely even when I'm with them my family cause while they do make me feel good they can't cover up for my nonexistent social life.Seriously I feel like a mess I roam around feeling down like I've never felt before I think. Just want to vent a little ,Personality-disorder
50523,I think I have AvPD avoidant personality disorder I have recently come across AvPD and I realized that I relate to almost all of the symptoms. First off Im very anxious in almost all social situations. This includes hanging around friends ive known for many many years being around extended family who ive also known for many years being around coworkers meeting new people and even just going grocery shopping. I often try to avoid a lot of social situations which has definitely affected a lot of my relationships. Im not very close with my friends or family anymore. I still hangout with them sometimes but its not on a very deep level. I dont really open myself up to anyone. Im scared of people figuring out my true personality and that they wont like me for who I am. I hide lots of parts of my personality and not one person on this earth truly knows me. Im close enough with my parents that I dont get anxious around them however I still hide many pieces of myself and dont feel comfortable enough to show everything about myself. I have also struggled to find jobs that dont make me anxious. It took me until I was 18 years old until I finally got my first job because of this. I currently work at a daycare and have worked here for about 7 months and my anxiety has seemed to get worse. I have been thinking about quitting for awhile now but am terrified of having the conversation with my boss about quitting. Whenever Im at work I feel inferior to everyone else. I feel like I have less experience I overthink everything and I am so awkward around my coworkers and parents. I feel like Im incompetent and people dont take me seriously because of my poor communication skills. My mind often goes blank when Im asked questions and I dont feel like Im much of a help. I also try to focus completely on the kids and I would rather not form any real relationships with other coworkers. I try to keep conversations polite and small. I rarely talk about myself either just enough to get by. I play it safe. Ive always just felt like there was something wrong with me. Social anxiety kinda describes the way I feel but it seems like its more than just that.,Personality-disorder
51516,does anyone else hide their phone from everyone or turn off the television when someone else walks into the room? Not because they are doing something suspicious but because they don't want their preferences or choices to be seen? I have the option to watch YouTube on a smart TV but instead I watch it on a tiny little phone screen with earphones when I'm in company because I don't want anyone to see my web or streaming history even if it's something as innocuous as looking up a recipe or reading an online news article. I just feel so much fear of someone looking at my internet history although it's generally harmless and boring crap.I remember being 10 years old and my brother being angry at me because I would turn off the TV and act all shifty when he walked into the room.When I was a child I would hide my drawings from my parents and classmates because I would be so embarrassed. That was my first sign of AVPD.I was eventually diagnosed at 21 and again by another psychologist at 27.,Personality-disorder
51491,Who is my first love? Have I fallen in love yet? As someone with AVPD I have trouble connecting with people. I know I'm smart and attractive and I care for people but it's my lack of social skills that make it hard for people to see the real me. I've had two guys like me back in the past few years. Which one of them would be considered my first love?The first guy Dave I met when I was 19 on vacation. He and I would just talk at the pool about politics and education even though he was kind of a party guy he has a nerdy side. We only hung out for two days but after our first day hanging out the second day he was really shy talking to me. But our romance was cut short because he had a girlfriend and made the mistake of spilling the beans about his crush on me to other kids at the resort. He cut off contact with me but when they broke up a month later he started looking at my social media a lot. Not to mention he made a playlist about me for my birthday. We don't even talk so I don't know if this is some sort of peace offering or apology. The second guy Steve I met a year later at my job. He and I bonded on the first day of work about growing up in the same hometown and I told my mom that day about how we bonded over our parallel lives. We worked together for a little over a year. And we never went out or anything but he would hit on me a lot. But stupid me was either too dense to realize he was flirting or too surprised in the moment to say any good flirting lines back. But a customer asked me for my number one day and I gave it to him. I guess I kind of wanted to motivate my crush to ask me out but literally the week after he went out with his sister's friend the sister set them up but they broke up and he likes me.View Pollhttpswww.reddit.compoll11wpn90,Personality-disorder

51162,Im pretty sure no one even likes me cant cope My whole life everyone has been at best indifferent to me amp often times just outright abusive to me. The depths to which I feel alone cant even be put into words this isnt a new thing its always been this way but its really starting to hit me that Im living for people who dont care to do a damn thing to help me amp maybe theres just something deeply wrong with me for no one to ever care about me at all. I truly dont think I can keep going with no hope of ever having any connection with anyone amp I dont know what to do. Its not like I even have anything to live for for me. My life is completely empty the only people I have around me demand so much of me ampor hurt me. I dont think Im even capable of building a better life amp if I am then I dont know if Im capable of making it for that long with absolutely no help from anyone. My whole life feels like such a waste Ive never had any purpose.,Personality-disorder
50602,suffering from AvPD as an ugly guy is like a cruel joke sometimes I can't believe i'm in this situation lol it's like a nightmare. You know nothing is gonna change even if you cure this sickness because you are ugly and getting excluded is a natural procces for you.Edit Posting something like this was a miskate. Looks like when you are an ugly man you can't talk about your problems and when you do people tell you its all your fault and you have a shitty personality you cannot say the opposite otherwise you will get downvoted to the bottom. Thanks to our helpful users here today i learned i'm a sexist schizophrenic guy who has some personality issues and treats other people like shiteven tho they dont talk to me for more than 10 seconds.,Personality-disorder
51093,Want to resign from my job Hey all Im really struggling at the moment and all I can think about is resigning from my role. Im a social worker who provides therapy to childrenadolescents with complex mental health difficulties. Ive been working at the organisation for 11 months now and roughly a week ago I changed my workplace location to be closer to home. Its the same service just a different location. Oh .. and Im acting in a senior position at the new workplace as part of a six month secondment. I thought that starting fresh would make me feel more motivated and confident however Im still feeling like an imposter scared and worried about criticism. Extremely terrified of social interactions too. Just knowing I have to see clients and speak to them gives me major anxiety. Im also on antidepressants and beta blockers which help a bit but I still dread the work that I have to do.All I keep thinking about is waking up in the morning switching off my mobile phone and driving far away to a relaxing environment like a beach pretending I have no responsibilities or cares in the world. I know thats not possible though.If I did resign I would make sure never to find a therapy role again as its not something Im too keen on and social interactions terrify me. Should I keep trying to work in spite of the anxiety I experience? I think Ive given it a fair shot and I cant take it anymore! Any advice would be greatly appreciated.. thanks!,Personality-disorder
51240,I'm ashamed of myself. I met a girl online in November and we tried to hit it off. It was a sort of long distance relationship since she lives about an hour's drive from me not critical but we don't have a car neither of us or days off to see eachother too often. In fact we've never met.On new year's eve she was attacked by a mutual acquaintance and she got bummed out and always kept apologizing when she thought she offended me.I felt so bad every time. I broke up a few days ago I dont know if you can really call it a break up since we never even met yet because I felt like garbage and I didn't want her to depend on me since I don't even know what to do to take care of myself.I didn't even have the courage to hear her afterwards. I apologized in advance in my last message to her and archived and silenced her chat before she could even text me back.I...Pat me on the back pls...,Personality-disorder
