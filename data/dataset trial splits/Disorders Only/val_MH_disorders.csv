35709,Recurring chest pain with no other symptoms Ive had a lot of intense stress the past year and also suffer from an anxiety disorder so it seems to be affecting my body a lot. I went to the ER back in February because my chest hurt and I had a lot of coughing and they did a chest xray and CT scan and monitored my heart rate and everything came back clean for heart issues with reassurance from the radiologist that Im very low risk for heart issues. I was diagnosed with pleurisy which was verified by my regular doctor and got better after a couple weeks. The chest pain has seemed to linger though and my stress has not improved. I have no other symptoms with this chest pain other than anxiety that its something bad. Im afraid to waste more money going to the hospital again since they ran tests that came back clean. Could this be something I need to have checked out again? ,Anxiety
34592,17 Need professional help but not sure if parents understand that I'm 17 and male. Since last year I've constantly thought im going to have a heart attack cardiophobia. It's really starting to get in the way. It started with bad heart palpitations and arm pain and I took multiple trips to the urgent care center and a few ekgs and they all said I was fine. It takes me so long to fall asleep at night because of this I get anxiety attacks often and I've formed a habit where I need to knock on wood almost all the time to calm me down a bit weird habit I'm not overweight and I go for bike rides a lot but my dad is always telling me to workout because he loves working out. I tried it months ago but the fear I was going to have one multiplied and I couldn't stand feeling my heart beat. He's trying to have me do guided meditation but for some reason that makes me way more anxious than when I started. He hasn't wanted me to go to therapy because I haven't committed to his solutions yet. I get and appreciate he's trying to help but I really wanted professional help. I went to them in tears a couple weeks ago saying please just let me get some professional help and my mom said she'd find someone. Fast forward to today and I found out she got my a family psychologist one that already sees my 10 year old brother he gets very angry. I wanted an actual therapist I'm not sure if it's the same thing and my mom is saying that he's just going to say the same things we've been saying and it's going to cost a lot I'm not trying to make my parents look bad because I get they're trying to help and my mom used to have a lot of problems with depression and anxiety when she was a teen so I'm sure she gets it but I just dont know what the fuck I'm supposed to do anymore. Looking for any advice. I usually take my mind off it by hanging out with my friends by the campfire at night and that sort of stuff but I moved from New England to TX 3 months ago and I haven't made any close friends yet. I just need some advice this stresses me out so bad every day thinking I'm going to die please and thank you so much.,Anxiety
52065,Anxiety developing over Texts Some background Im currently 18 and I was the girl who had a big group of friends who genuinely didnt hate each other and kept in touch last semester of High school I lost touch and lost many friends even my two friends of 4 years. I did get diagnosed with panic disorder but I also know panic attacks arent the only thing I get and I can develop anxiety over many things. I started dating a guy early in 2022 and towards the end I had started getting anxious over texts and even looking at iMessage itself sometimes then I developed some anxiety and shakiness when I wouldnt hear back from him for a long time. It was a dark time for me and I noticed I started getting anxious and was having bad thoughts about myself. Now I met this new guy probably a week after I broke it off with my ex and hes great were not dating but definitely exclusive but from 5pm 9pm he doesnt message me for a long time and I understand hes eating dinner wants alone time for his own things but I hate having this shakiness in my hands and it feels like a rock weighing me down and Im shaking everywhere all over my body like I cant move. Sometimes I think the solution is to tell him hey can you text me back in x amount of time or I dont like how you dont message me for awhile sure short term solution but I know things will come up and hell eventually resent me for making him do that and this goes way beyond him as well. Even if we break things off in the future I dont want to have major anxiety over the next guy and go through these feelings again and again and I want a permanent solution. Help?,Anxiety

34526,Terrified of brain amoeba fowleri Hi everyone. I'm down in South Australia and I've found myself going a little insane over something very silly for the last day....I will start by saying that our water has a decent amount of chlorine as far as I can tell it's the only thing you can taste in the water and if you fill a bathtub it's even ever so slightly green. There's never been an order to boil water or anything of the sort either here.So moving onto story time. I often get itchy eyes before bed so I keep a glass of water in the bathroom that way I can rinse my eyes out quickly to calm things down the glass of water had probably been out for a few hours anywhere from 6 12. Last night I did it and as the water ran down my face a little bit got in my nose maybe a drop or 2 tops. I started freaking a minute later as I remembered all I'd read about fowleri.... I blew my nose a bunch and I rolled up some toilet paper and stuck it up my nostril as well in an attempt to deal with any water that had made its way up there. I spent a terrified hour in bed reading things on my phone and eventually calmed down enough to sleep.Now all day today I haven't had a fever or anything of the sort but I have been getting sinus headaches. Quite possibly from blowing my nose so much And I got rather paranoid in the shower too anytime water got near my nose or even the tiniest bit might have entered I freaked out a bit. My right nostril which is the one the water entered is also worse than the left but the discomfort might just be from me freaking out and blowing it a ton... I have bad sinuses at the best of times so it could just be dust or allergies too.I know I'm probably being silly but some confirmation would be lovely especially since the glass of water while cold was sitting out a long time... A day of sinus headaches just doesn't exactly fill me with confidence even if it probably was cause I wouldn't leave things alone. One last thing to note is that 2 family members of mine recently had colds so that might be why I'm feeling crappy sinus wise too the right side being worse than the left still has me all freaked out though.,Anxiety
34878,Cut myself on a rusty key clip and now I think I have tetanus The cut is very minor it broke the skin enough to expose blood. And now my neck feels stiff and painful. But I know it probably isnt tetanus but it still sucks because I cannot stop thinking about it. I mostly feel stupid because I only cut myself on the key clip by playing around with it idly while not paying attention. ,Anxiety
35373,Anxiety over tests Hi there aside from therapy wondering if any of you could share advice about how to get over anxiety when doing medical tests. I recently had an ultrasound and was in tears during it bc I had convinced myself that something scary would be found. It was to the point that the radiologist came to talk to me and gave me the results on the spot. I greatly appreciated this but I understand is not possible every time. I have a follow up MRI scheduled for next week likely to confirm an incidentaloma and Im having a VERY hard time. Ive rescheduled it twice and I dread the two days I will have to wait for the results. The anxiety is crippling. Thanks for reading and any advice you can give me. ,Anxiety

35500,Im convinced I have a urethral stricture In may of last year I had a type of explosion in my bladder. It came with an insane feeling of urgency frequency and a feeling that myBladder was in the grip of a vice. I also had an electrical type feeling in my bladder and Perineum.I saw a urologist who thought I had a urethral stricture. I was sent for a cystoscopy that showed everything was ok. That was in September 2018. 3 months later the urgency and frequency decreased but then what accompanied was pelvic pain tailbone pain I had to start sitting down to urinate and I had to start milking my urethra to empty it at this time I was also tapering from 6mgs of clonazepam. I hit 2mgs when this started. I finished my taper on clonazepam in the middle of February.I now have all of those symptoms but theyre at full force now. For the past two weeks I had a slight burn at the end of urination. Peeing didnt hurt but at the end I had a sharpburn pain in a specific area in the top of my penisurethra. For the past two weeks Ive had a feeling that theres a marble stuck in my urethra. Sometimes I can feel pressure in my urethra when I move about. Sometimes I get a sharp stabbing pain down my urethra too. The side of my penis hurts too. IAlso have to gently milk my urethra to get the rest of the urine out. My fear is that the cystoscopy has caused a stricture. Its done the very thing that it was supposed to rule out. There was no blood after it was done nor did it burn when I peed but the tip of my penis was very swollen for anHour or so. Apparently its extremely rare for someone to get a stricture from a routine cystoscopy especially in the area I think mine is. But Im 100 convinced that I have one. Its making me very ill. I see the urologist in 5 days time. Im in a chronic pelvic pain support group and apparently this is a very common symptom. But other guys have the same symptoms and have a stricture. I dont want another cystoscopy but Im guessing Ill have to have one as its the only way to treat a stricture. I cant believe Im in this mess. Im so upset and frustrated. ,Anxiety
34015,Did the elliptical really mess me up like this? Hey everyone would love some input I've been getting odd chest sensations for a while now along with shoulder back and neck pains. I spoke to my doctor and he believes it's posture related. But lately this week the chest discomfort has become more pronounced. I went to the gym two days ago and while I was on the elliptical I started feeling this almost burning sensation in my chest. It subsided somewhat once I stopped. That same sensation has come and gone since and now I have a spot that's sore to the touch right over my sternum. I'm thinking it's reflux related especially since I'm on meds for that and I've been burping a lot but does anyone else have any insight? I'm really trying to avoid going to the doctor for every little thing.,Anxiety

51883,Anxiety is ruining my life I am now into my 30s and feel like my life is passing me by while I am unable to enjoy it due to being anxious all of the time. I have a great job and feel like I am going to ruin it because I am so socially anxious and awkward. The only time I feel like I can truly enjoy the company of other people and not feel like my flight or flight is x100 is when I take a low dose opiate or drink alcohol. I stopped doing all of it for two years thinking that I might get better if I dont use any substances but it just spiraled into extreme anxiety and depression since I didnt get any breaks from it. I have tried every SSRISNRITCA under the sun and they dont work. I dont know what the point of this post is other than to vent I guess.,Anxiety
34014,Paranoid about a healing bump on the forehead So almost two weeks ago last Monday I decided to go to Urgent Care because of chest pains. On my way to the car I opened the door and it whacked me in the forehead.I had a huge egg on my forehead above my right eye and it has almost gone down completely. The only bump is a small vertical line raised that isn't much longer than 34. But because it is a line and it hurts to touch it as well as after touching it my brain is telling me I'm going to die of a blood clot or a stroke. Can someone please help convince me this isn't the case? Dumb brain trying to scare me.,Anxiety
35368,Hypochondria as an early symptom of dementia? I decided to take a break from scaring myself to death with medical craziness online and for once actually wanted to learn about Hypochondria I guess you could say it was an eye opening moment where I myself saw myself from a logical standpoint. As I sifted through the Google pages I ended up coming across a slew of articles relating to Hypochondria being one of the earliest signs of Frontotemporal Lobe Dementia and Lewy Body Dementia. My first initial reaction was complete anger. I had abused my Google privileges for so long looking at the scariest possible diseases. The one time I do exactly what people have been telling me to do dude look up what ANXIETY does to your body and mind not this I get forced back into hell. As you can imagine I checked it out. There were actually many articles and case reports regarding it that it kinda scared me. I had been worried specifically about dementia for the past month for a bunch of oddandend reasons..and then Google relays the term in reference to my hypochondriaanxiety...? It is the coincidence now that is flipping me out and confirming my fear even more. That is some bizarre..not even intentional coincidence dont you think? How do you even distinguish the difference between hypochondria as a VERY early symptom of dementia vs hypochondria because you are a hypochondriac?,Anxiety

52570,Advice Ive been dealing with some anxiety issues my whole life. Ive had lots of trama and was diagnosed with ADHD as a young child. Never being able to focus and always the most loud and distributive in school. I used to stay up at night as a kid because after watching the slightest scary movie I would be afraid. Anyways the point of the backstory is to give you a sense of who I was. Lately within the past year my anxiety has been through the roof. I find it very hard to focus and have lots of thoughts at once. Even some that just pop into my head. I can hear other peoples tone of voice. Not like big conversation. My anxiety was so high I was getting lots of physical symptoms heart palpitations chest pain shortness of breath to which I thought I had a heart problem. So I went to the doctors and got all the tests and didnt believe my heart was fine until I got the results. I thought about this everyday. To which now I think this might had been a delusion. My point is Im very worried Im developing Schizophrenia. My family does have a history of mental health issues.I know this post is confusing and if Im worried about my mental health I should see a doctor. But Im just looking for advice.EditI would like to add that for a long time when I went home after a long day I could not relax to fall asleep. My mind would be racing. The only way I could describe it is like a radio. In order to drown it out I would have to put on music to fall asleep.,Anxiety

Anyways im not experiencing pain as much as I am pressure and sensations if you know what I mean but it feels so impossible to tell if its just manifestations of my anxiety. Im on a tight budget and have a history with HA so my question for you guys is do you have any ideas for breaking point symptopms or signs that I should wait for to see urgent care?Thank you!!!,Anxiety

51853,I've missed about 3 weeks of class and I'm too embarrassed to go backwhat do I do? Hi I've recently started medication to help manage my anxiety. While adjusting to the medication I noticed it helped my society anxiety a lot because I stopped caring. However the downside is that I started to become very apathetic about everything and lost a lot of motivation to even get out bedgo to class. I've recently started a new medication and so far feelings of apathylack of productivity have improved and I can now finish tasks still not perfect but I feel like with such a low starting dose it feels back to like how I've felt premedication. The problem is my social anxiety has gone back up. I'm ashamed and embarrassed to have missed so much class. I tried really hard this week and forced myself to go to classes I've been avoiding but there is one class that I'm especially having a hard time getting myself to attend. The problem is the class is very discussion based and we have predetermined groups we work with the entire semester. I'm worried my groupmates will judge me because I haven't been to class in so long I just want to avoid the awkward confrontation Where have you been? even though I know it's inevitable. How do I force myself to go to class?,Anxiety

35749,Scared Ive got cervical cancer Hiya. Ive been trying to keep my HA at bay been plagued by it for 15yrs almost now. Currently worrying I have cervical cancer and I cant check because I have vaginismus whenever I try to have smear tests. Ive had a lot going on since October last year and tried to seek answers from health professionals I say that so lightly and people on Reddit for advice. Ive had loads of symptoms since January that you can get with various stages of cervical cancer but I dont know if its based on basic stuff. Ive had around 5 blood tests stool samples ultrasounds of my ovaries in that time and two unsuccessful smear exams. Im super scared but apparently any changes could be picked up in bloodwork Ive been told by a semi professional my bfs mum is a GP so I try to ask him to get her opinions etc. Im so scared and keep googling cervical cancer and the signs. Tho Ive had swabs taken from just outside my cervix tho that wont detect any normalities. I just wanna be normal and not worry. This is the second cancer scare Ive put myself through since February ,Anxiety

34350,It looks like I've found a home. My anxiety is ruining my life Hello everyone! So I have been suffering from severe health anxiety for years now it's about my heart. When I was 18 I fell down the stairs in my house and when I got up my heart was beating totally out of rhythm seeming at random turned out I had AFib and I had to get shocked twice back into normal rhythm. I am 22 now and have never gone back into Afib but from what doctors have told me it's only a matter of time and usually it gets more and more common until it's always there. This scares the shit out of me. On top of that for whatever reason I get SVT's when I have panic attacks so my heart just beats out of my chest and it feels awful like what I would imagine a heart attack would feel like. So now I'm scared of getting these SVT's and since I'm scared of getting them I'll panic and actually get them. Just a giant negative feedback loop. I'm on cipralex for anxiety and have been for two years but just learned from a pharmacists that it can cause even more heart rhythm issues which is the source of my current anxiety attack since the cipralex doesn't help at all anyways. How do you guys deal with this stuff? Other than with copious amounts of Ativan like I am now. Which still isn't helping. ,Anxiety

34108,Really bad health anxiety at night Some background... I was diagnosed with OCD in the third grade but was suspected of having it long before that. I have bad intrusive thoughts. I've been in and out of therapy for many years. Within the past few years my health anxiety has gotten bad again like it was when I was a child. In late 2016 when I was 19 I went through a phase where I thought I was dying Every. Single. Night. I ended up having so many panic attacks and losing a lot of friends. I lost over 60 pounds in like 23 months. I got into a relationship on the tail end of this breakdown and am still with my partner. It helped a lot and continues to help.Now like a year and a half later it's not as bad as it was in that period but the symptoms linger still. I haven't had a checkup since a little before the breakdown in 2016. I'll go to the doctor if I catch a cold or whatever but not for a checkup.Now....this is because I'm like terrified that I'll find out that I have a terminal illness. Cancer of any type kidney failure some kind of disease... whatever it doesn't matter. Whenever I think about it I freak out and get nauseous and scared. When I'm laying in bed at night I will feel my boobs for lumps and always convince myself something is there when it isn't in different parts of my boobs. I've gotten to a point where I dont even like touching them. I know it would be better to just find out and get to fix it asap but it scares me so bad I'm afraid it would just ruin my will to live. I'm not currently in therapy but I know i need to be.It's the worst at night when my boyfriend is asleep but it's seeping over into my daily life. If my biology prof starts talking about cancer my thoughts just spiral out of control making me think I have it. It's gotten so bad that I actually have anxiety about the anxiety itself. I just need to know that I'm not alone. I would also appreciate any advices or exercises that help...,Anxiety

At first I thought it was my wisdom tooth coming through as the swelling and pain was around that area and I could feel the crown coming up then the swelling went down but the pain remained then I felt pain in my jaw and noticed there was a large lump on it that wasnt there before it felt a bit like bone. Thats still there and it still aches but then yesterday my ear started aching and Ive just woken up this morning and it still hurts AND it feels full so I cant hear out of it.

34631,How to escape an HA hole when the symptoms persist? Ive been sick for awhile with a diagnosed but generally not serious sinus infection but lately Ive been noticing some other things which I wont mention so you dont fall down the same hole Im in and those things of course led me to the worst possible idea Googling my symptoms. I came across something rare sporadic and deadly of course and Im now constantly worried that its something that could be far more serious. Even though I went to my general practitioner for the sinus infection today and mentioned the other strange symptom I didnt mention the name of the specific thing I think I could have because it felt ridiculous and the symptoms were subsiding. He felt the area and chalked it up to side effects of the sinus infection but of course since he didnt SPECIFICALLY say its not and the symptoms have come back im now back to spiraling between youre just making it worse and maybe I should make sure just to be safe. Any advice to get my mind off of the possibility when I still feel like Im feeling the symptoms? I have this huge urge to go back to a doctor and get specific reassurance but I know thats problematic in the long run and could end up getting expensive for no real reason. Not to mention Id feel a bit ridiculous. Really starting to think I should see a psych as I havent since my anxiety began as a more generalized disorder a little over a year ago ,Anxiety
51794,Something familiar started popping up in regards to work and its got me worried So back in 2017 I worked at a restaurant as a dishwasher as my first job. But after the busy season ended I was laid off. Not only that but was basically laid off with no one even telling me since my boss at the time basically acted like I didnt exist when I tried contacting them about potentially coming back. For roughly 5 years since I basically jumped from one seasonal job to another. Then last year I found myself being rehired in the same position but this time the place is under new management. And honestly Ive loved it. Not only is a job I enjoy with a salary that is better than I would have initially expected but it also allowed me to make awesome new friends and get reacquainted with old ones. But since the start of the holiday season Ive been off duty so to speak until the dining room opens back up in May. Ive recently found out in the company group chat that it will open up on Mothers Day weekend to which I responded roughly with awesome. So I guess that will be roughly when Im coming back? That was 2 days ago and since then the group chat had been dead silent. Id assume it was cause everyone was busy and didnt see but the chat says that pretty much everyone saw it. And now its starting to feel similar to when I got laid off when I first worked there. And I dont know why I would be since pretty much everyone has said how awesome I am for how hard I work and how good I am at my job. So considering that I may not have anything to worry about. But the fact that everyone saw that specific message yet didnt say anything in response feels suspicious at the very least. What should I do? Do I have reason to worry or am I just worrying too much about nothing?,Anxiety

Whenever I simply text someone I worry Im bothering them and feel really embarrassed Im afraid of getting close to new people because what if they end up changing their minds get bored and ghost me? Im afraid of being forgotten about,Anxiety
35675,Pain in right brow not going away? I have pain in my right brow. The eye itself doesn't hurt when I push on it however when I push up on the brow it hurts. When I lean forward there's a pulsing pain in my brow as well. What can this be? Dehydration? Tension headache? I can't figure it out.Thanks in advance.,Anxiety
34988,Back here again Damn colon cancer.I'm afraid again and it seems more palpable than ever. This started two years ago after getting some blood work done. I got in my head that I could have colon cancer.All my symptoms began after all results were good. I started having some light blood on my stool a line here and there. Then my right lymph node grew then shrunk then grew and so on it's still swollen but smaller. Then I started having diarrhea and watery dolls with a feeling of incomplete evacuation. Then I started noticing my skin is getting pale more visible veins.I sometimes see myself going from normal to pale to normal a couple of times in a day. I do the palmar crease pallor test almost constantly now.I noticed that my fingernails were either pale or blue ish sometimes started thinking of iron deficiency and that scares the cap out of me.Then I started feeling weaker tired after very little effort should note that I put on 10 kg in this time. Arms started feeling weaker got some armpit pain chest pain etc.Then my back started hurting. My lower left back. Sometimes my lower right too. Then it started hurting more and more often. Now it hurts along my left leg as well as left hip. I read a post a while ago that said the op was diagnosed after very similar symptoms so naturally I started freaking out again.Now I'm seeing some similar stuff with my dad and it really drives me back to freaking out.I don't know what to do anymore. I'm at the end of my rope. ,Anxiety
52472,I don't know what to do. I don't know how to do it. I don't know where I am. I don't know where I'm going. By tomorrow night I 21 yo UK university student have to email my dissertation supervisor a draft of what I have written so far the deadline is in May and he wants to give me some feedback before the upcoming Easter break. But the problem is that I haven't written anything. At all. I've collated dozens of pages of general notes vague ideas and research over the last few months but I don't have a clue what to do with it or where to start.I've written probably hundreds of assessments and essays in my life and until a few weeks ago I had not failed a single one of them. But a few weeks ago my motivation selfbelief and general ability to work which were all low to begin with anyway just stopped altogether. I had deadlines for two course module assessments within a week of each other and I missed both of them. For one of the first times in my education I had not only failed with work but I had failed to even complete the work. I missed the first one because I had zero interest in knowledge of or care for the subject because I kept procrastinating and because it's possible that I have ADHD I don't want to know about this but I think I have it. I missed the second one because of the same reasons and because I failed the first one so it didnt make a difference if I missed the second one.Since I got the email last week from my supervisor that I have to send him whatever I've been working on by tomorrow Tuesday I've not only not been working on the dissertation but I've detached myself from it almost completely. I dont like thinking about it. I keep distracting myself from it literally and mentally because I don't want to do it. The subject itself interests me it was my choice after all and ive done a lot of research too much I think and every time I ever doubt my work ability like this which is every time ive ever done an assessment in my three years at university it usually turns out alright but I can't see how this one of course the most important one will end in anything other than failure. So Ive come all this way from the start of uni three years ago from the start of reception 17 years ago and I've always at the very least managed to succeed. But now of all times is when it stops.Im aware that every student who has ever tried to write a university thesis has had these doubts at some time or a lot of the time. But that makes me feel all the more incapable. Because those students have all and will all get through it and I know that I won't. I look around the university library that I'm currently writing this in and all I see is people working theyre focused selfdisciplined and content to be here. But Im not one of them. I know that I dont belong here and I dont like it here. I really don't like coming here. But I come here nevertheless. I'm sitting here wasting more time on something that I don't have to do that I shouldn't be doing but I'm doing nevertheless. Because I think a part of me actually wants to fail. I don't know why anyone would want that especially me I've always feared failure the confirmation of it by my university and parents the consequences of it practically and emotionally and that's whats driven me to always succeed with my work in education. I've only ever done that work because I fear the consequences of not doing it. I do it because I have to never because I wanted to. I've always been like this.So why am I here then? If you never enjoyed school or college which i didn't then why did you actively decide to go to university? Hmm. Maybe because I thought I had to not because I wanted to pursue a career I have absolutely no ambition at all. And it was partly because the idea of getting a job after I left college at 18 seemed completely impossible I've suffered from social anxiety for most of my life the basics of social interaction are overwhelming to me. But mostly it was because I didn't think any of it through. I didn't want to think it through at all. My parents thought I could maybe go to this university so I just said okay. I didn't even look into the university at all and I didn't consider any others. The reason that I do this is because I hate thinking about the future short medium and long term. Whenever people ask me about the future whether its where do you see yourself in five years what do you want to do with your life or even simply do you have any plans for the weekend Ive always given vague nonanswers. I've been like this forever. Probably because Ive been bombarded with these questions from career advisors since Year 1. But it's also because the future is too uncertain and complicated. It scares me to think about the future in any sort of way. So I don't. And now I'm paying the price. And the future gets closer every day. And I wish I could go back in time maybe to live things differently maybe to live them the same. I think about the past my childhood especially every day. And every single night I dream about the past too. The other day I had one about the last day of Year 11. Ive had hundreds like it all about the last day of secondary school. The thing that haunts me about it is the fact that I dont remember what happened. All I remember is that I never saw any of my peers again after that day. Because I made the conscious decision to leave them and go to a different college. Every single dream I have involves my old school friends. Every one.In case it isn't clear my recent doubts over starting let alone completing or succeeding with my dissertation are related to so many other things that I have consciously often deliberately bottled up over the years and it is years. I know how unhealthy and dangerous it is to do this but I do it anyway because it's easier and because it's been the default way of accepting contemplating and processing my emotions for as long as I can remember. I've never had the desire to tell anyone including family about my most vulnerable thoughts and feelings fears and insecurities becausewellwhere to start? Fear of judgement fear of being misunderstood fear of being understood fear of the literal and emotional consequences on myself and on my relationships the fact that emotions were and are are never discussed in my family or in the few social circles I used to have note haven't had friends for five years. I bottle all of this up. And I'll continue to. But it feels like the bottle is starting to overflow.If anyone has read this far you might as well consider yourself the first person who has ever heard anything that is even remotely as private as what I've just revealed in these last few paragraphs. And if you've read this far and if you are a healthy normal person you will have obviously thought to yourself Yeah he needs therapy. But I don't think I do and I certainly don't want to. Theres a small part of me that desires to let it all out I could write a book about all of my problems but I know that would be a terrifying and draining experience even if it leads to something better. And the desire certainly isn't big enough for me to have serious thoughts about seeking helpfrom anyone in fact. I think thats the bottomline regardless of whether I need help or guidance or advice or support or sympathy I don't think I want it. Not enough anyway. I think Id hate myself for seeking it out because I'd feel like a desperately sad narcissist. I know I'm pathetic dumb probably annoying an embarrassment a failure a waste of space time money and effort but I dont think I'm a narcissist. And I know that people who seek help aren't narcissistic but I would think that I am if I did. So I don't. And I've never sought help from anyone. Not only the serious personal stuff but the little trivial specific things too. Is it because of a deeprooted social anxiety and my complete lack of social confidence ability and experience? Yes. But like with my other anxieties that I probably need help with health anxiety fear of the future fear of the passage of time the fear of failure the fear of work the fear of my dissertation I don't care about help or support or selfimprovement. I dont want any of it because I think it wont work for me or that it doesn't apply to me. I dont want to be helped. And yet here I am writing this.,Anxiety
34917,Can a lot of strenuous intense exercise after each other in a day cause heart damage? It was more than a week ago where my heartrate was high all day. For some reason I believe I damaged my heart without feeling any significant pain. This kind of thinking is fucking scary. It sends you right down the rabbit hole of anxiety. My heart was tested extensively almost a complete year ago and it turned out well.But then I rationalize that something bad happened and my perception of my beating heart becomes clearer and clearer and I feel it more and more.I don't know what to fucking do now. I am too lazy to go to a doctor again to test myself for the so manyth lt not a word time. But I have to.. Or not? Or do I.. I might die if I won't.. I'm fucking scared. Normal people won't go to the doctor when they feel nothing.. Or do they? What if my body is suffering in silence? Oh my fucking God. I cannot die.,Anxiety

51672,New to this. Need coping skills Hello I am new to this community but I wanted some help. Ill start with some context. Ive always been a person that throws up and a lot of the time it was when I was nervous. This past year tho it has gotten much worse with a time where I even went to the hospital because I hadnt eaten in like 2 days and I felt so physically exhausted and dehydrated. At first I thought it was from weed and something called CHS but quitting weed didnt really make a difference. I also have delt with this vommiting in highschool before I would go to a party I would get so nervous I would puke. And that was before I ever touched weed.This led me to go to a gastro doctor who said he did not think it was weed related and instead some inflammation in intestines. Ive been on meds for that for 3 months but it was getting better and I really started to take my anxiety seriously so I went to my doctor and they prescribed me an SSRI. I also will start therapy in a few weeks here. For the past month after about 1.5 month on SSRI I have been doing better. I hadnt thrown up for a month but these past 2 nights I have had very panic attack like feelings and tonight even pushed me to the point where I had to get up from being comforted by my girlfriend to throw up. And I always feel awful about it and like its going to just keep happening and I think I get stuck in that cycle.Does anyone have any tipsadvice on dealing with this before my therapy appointment I thought I was doing so good but now Im afraid Im slipping back.,Anxiety

51887,I didn't have the courage to go to an event bc of anxiety I was supposed to go to a pub crawl event this evening but got cold feet right before the event started and now I'm sad disappointed and alone at my home. The first three hours before the event I was feeling okay and so sure I would be going but slowly the panic started to kick in. And I ended up shaking and crying while changing my clothes and getting ready for the evening. And then I just gave up. It sucks I really wanted to go the event sounded like a blast and I already bought the ticket. It all came crashing down when I realised that I don't know anyone from the event and that I had to make the effort of meeting new people there alone. I thought I could be brave and go to that place alone because none of my friends didn't want to come with me. I have gone to events before alone and it has been fine in the end even if I was super anxious about going there beforehand. I guess today was just not my day... ,Anxiety

34554,Hantavirus freaking out vacuumed large amount of what looked like mouse droppings from engine bay of car. Im seriously worried right now. Heres my info. Male 21 yrs old 165 lbs 511No previous health issues and no medicationsI purchased an older vehicle from Alabama I live in northern Illinois on March 3rd 2018. It was shipped that day and arrived March 6th 2018. On March 25th 2018 I opened up the engine cover It is a van and discovered a large amount of broken nuts or acorns and what looked like mouse droppings small round pellets about the size of rice on top of the engine along with a few chewed wires. Im assuming that at some point this van sat for a period of time not sure if recently before purchase but I assume not as there are was no sign of a current infestation to the previous owner prior to purchase. Anyway fast forward to me cleaning it out a few days ago with a regular household vacuum. I dont believe I used a respirator mask for all of the time but if I did it was a 3 one that is made for basic things like sanding not for chemicals or pathogens. I vacuumed it up for quite awhile probably about an hr. My question is am I at risk for hantavirus? It seems that the virus wouldnt survive after excretion for very long and assuming that the mice were active until the very day that the van was picked up in Alabama unlikely there still wouldve been about 2.5 weeks between then and when I first opened up the engine compartment and another week or so until I vacuumed it up. Any knowledge or experience with this? Lifespan of hantavirus after excretion? Im killing my self over this and my anxiety is giving me a bunch of symptoms. Thank you in advance! ,Anxiety

34219,How do you stop fuzzing? My friend is as healthy as can be but eversince I started really knowing him there's been something wrong. He'd go to the doctor clear up whatever condition he thought he had and then he'll go home and start googling every single aspect of his bodily functions. For example Smelling burning wood then he thinks obviously something is wrong with his nose now?? Until eventually he discovers some other condition he may have. Then he stresses it until a doctor clears it up again and then repeat. He would sit for hours up at night reading symptoms and unfortunately that is not exaggeration.He's never fine never normal never healthy in his mind. And as much as it annoys me its worrisome. Because there's no helping a person that always thinks that he knows better.I'm looking for someone who can advise him on how you coped or even escaped this state of mind.

35241,Self diagnosis past 4 months I thought I would just list all the diseasesproblems I've convinced myself I've had the past few months. Multiple trips to the Dr multiple blood tests everything coming back clear. Diabetes HIV throattonguemouth cancer MS lupus overactive thyroid and sjogrens syndrome. Yup it's been a tough few months I've lost so much sleep thinking about how I'm going to tell my friends and family will I have to move back home to die? But I'm so young this is so unfair? I'm still struggling but for the past week I've stopped googling and honestly it has helped. I still get the thoughts and worries but by not googling they do not manifest in my mind as much. My doctor has diagnosed me with something though and that something is anxiety. I think it's important to remember that anxiety does have LOADS of physical symptoms over 100! and can affect people in different ways. A website I find useful I know no googling but this is different right is httpswww.anxietycentre.comanxietysymptoms.shtml I've been lurking on this sub for the past month or so and can really relate to posts here on a daily basis. It's somewhat comforting to know you're not alone with these crazy thoughts. If anyone is struggling and wants someone to talk to my DMs are open have a great week everybody.

If doorbell goes it can do that.Would you say I have General anxiety? My eyes look ugly and intense when I am anxious and I hate eye contact when like this.

Find it hard to show natural emotions like smile etc. It's faked. I am use to routines.I want to overcome the above naturally. I do exercise and have gone out on walks each week either by myself or with parents family. I try various natural supplements that might just help.

So ever since that night ive basically been in fear of it happening again so for about id say 3 weeks now im basically just always nauseous i feel horrible but eventually forced myself too eat. In a huge twist that no one saw coming after eating I actually felt better so my brain was like aha! I did it! I know its just anxiety! I can fix it!...but we all know its not nowhere near that easy its still a challenge for me to eat and at least 3 nights a week im up laying in bed praying for it to go away and begging God to help me even tho im not religious in the slightest. Im actually up right now writing this feeling nauseous yet strangely hungry and yes i know if youre really hungry sometimes you feel nauseous but the nauseous i have most nights im fairly sure isnt that. I know this is probably written horribly but i havent been sleeping well as im sure you can imagine but basically what im looking for is has anyone else had anything like this and what did you do to help yourself? My family is pretty worried as ive also lost some weight and obviously they know im not eating.,Anxiety
34652,Palpable lymph node Im terrified... So two and a half weeks ago I went to the dentist with a tooth that was shaky after a previous filling had fallen out. Id been feeling a bit weird in my throat on the same side too. She looked it and firstly said it appears I have gingivitis. She had to extract my tooth surgically by altering the gums and said it was infected so put some medicine in it and temporarily closed it. The next day I went back and she opened it all up and then sutured my gums back together. When she checked my lymph nodes mainly under my neck I directed her to the mandibular node which had been noticeably hard for maybe a week before. She called it a palpable node and said it could be due to the infection and the antibiotics amoxicillin she prescribed should take care of the infection. Well almost three weeks later and Im freaking the fck out. My infection appears gone and Ive had no pain on that side since the extraction. My lymph node is still as palpable as before but whats worrying me is that its painless whereas when its an infection its usually quite tender? Its hard but a bit rubbery and moves around. It couldve been around a lot longer than just the three weeks its been since I need to push it out a little from against my jaw to feel it but I can REALLY feel it. I had a couple of random lumps in my armpit groin and side as well and whilst it felt hard they had sort of pus coming out of the end so I assumed they were harmless as they went down after a couple of days. This was before the dentist. Im scared its lymphoma. The reason for this isNight sweats Ive had this onoff for the past few years however. But Ive noticed it again despite keeping cool. Temperature regulation out of nowhere Ill get quite warm and then get a bit chilly again. The node is pretty much painless but despite the infection going its still the same size and hardness. General fatigue but I have that anyways recently its been muscle achesIm a smoker... and at times in the past year Ive been very heavy. Im just freaking the fck out. Can anyone let me know if they had anything similar? Or just put my mind at ease?I know I should go to the doctors but Ive just built up such a resistance to it with how much anxiety Ive had over it. I fear having to face the issue and find out I have something serious. Im booking a GP appointment for a couple of days time. But until then anyone have a clue what this could be? its slowly consuming every second of my life. ,Anxiety

34284,Absolutely terrified of having autism. Does anyone have fears of mental illness developmental delay? This would honestly be funny if it didnt scare me so badly. I dont really even know why it scares me this much and I feel bad because autism isnt strictly a negative. Its just a different wiring of the brain that emphasizes different skills. Its dumb but I cant help it. Last night I had a nightmare that I was actually autistic and that no one had ever told me so that I could live a more normal life. The whole thing shattered my perspective of myself in a way that was profoundly uncomfortable and was kind of from a third person view although I felt everything very intensely. I looked quite different but the thing that freaks me out is that what if I actually do look like that and just have a very limited outside perspective of myself. I also saw a bunch of ways that maybe certain interactions I thought were normal may only have felt alright because Im actually autistic. This all would just be a weird one off dream if I hadnt been terrified of being autistic for a long period last summer. I would spend every break possible at my summer internship taking diagnostic tests to prove to myself that I dont have it. I was an anxious mess.Since then Ive had a number of fears about having different mental illnesses everything from schizophrenia to NPD to bipolar and dont know quite what to do about it. I think I have ocd but I havent been able to go to therapy. Has anyone else had hypochondria about these specific themes? What strategies help you?Edit I also know that I dont have any of the symptoms but I cant help be afraid any way. ,Anxiety
52026,I'm hesitant to get a diagnosis So I've reached the point when I amassed enough courage to ask for an appointment with a psychiatrist. I've done therapy for about 5 years and never was brave enough to ask my therapist if I had either anxiety or depression. But 5 months ago I started with chronic tensional headaches finished college and found two jobs ended up very stressed which I controlled after a neurologist prescribed me pregabalin. However I've been struggling with other somatic symptoms that lead me to say okay you waited too much it's time to do it. Even though I hate the idea of being that selfdiagnose person I've been doing a lot of reflection and truly believe I have several symptoms of anxiety perhaps social or general anxiety.I will be seeing this doc who was very recommended to me and I fear judgment but much much more fear is if I get prescribed meds that mess me up worse. I know she's an outstanding professional she has appropiately medicated my bf's niece for anxiety and honestly doubt I'd need something strong but I'm so scared of start taking meds I fear there's no turning back from it. I fear it changes me so badly that I have bad moments at my job in front of everyone like crying or a panic attack or that I make an embarrassment. I don't want to lose my job since it there are two but the full time one has helped me to get out of my lifeless and procrastination days. Haven't seen my therapist lately since she had a temporary license and now I'm also unsure if I should come back because she never made me a diagnosis. My general doctor told me to come back to therapy asap. Sorry for the long post I'd like to know if someone relates to this or your experiences but mostly if you know about meds and if I'm just panicking too much or maybe I just need to know this before meeting the psychiatrist.,Anxiety

He constantly glances and stares at me. One time he was looking at me and I rolled my eyes and looked away from him. I looked back at him and he walked out of the room with a hurt upset look on his face.,Anxiety

For a while now my vision has been doing this thing where I go blind for a millisecond a few times in a row almost like Im blinking without actually blinking. My blood pressure is fine I dont get dizzy I dont have anxiety when it happens it just randomly happens.

34419,Didn't realize I wasn't alone it's honestly so refreshing that I am 1. Not crazy and 2. not alone. I feel alone. People always judge when I try to tell them how terrified of diseases especially STD's and almost make fun of me. My boyfriend is really supportive but it's rough because he has no idea how to tell it and tbh neither do I. I really wanna go on medication because it's to the point where it takes a daily toll on my life. I don't know anyone who has health anxiety like I do and it's just really scary. ,Anxiety
35840,How to handle being home alone? A couple months ago around Christmas my girlfriend who I live was out of town for a week leaving me in our apartment alone. I had been fine with this in the past but this time... It was really the first time I had any health anxiety and it hit HARD. I felt like I couldn't breathe felt like I was having a heart attack worried about having cancer all the fun problems.Since then I've gotten on SSRIs and have improved a lot but my girlfriend has to leave for another week soon. I think I'll be okay but I'm still a little worried that my anxiety is going to come back in full force. When she's home I have the comfort of knowing that she could take me to the hospital if anything awful happens but I feel very vulnerable when it's just me especially at night. I don't have any family or close friends around here so I can't depend on that either.Does anybody have any tips for how to feel more safe when you're on your own? Thanks in advance.,Anxiety
34562,Be careful of Google results. Don't click on calmclinic. Also my head hurts. I'd never seen the website before in my life but it was suddenly not only the promoted result and the top nonpromoted result when I googled a generic symptoms I know googling bad. I clicked out of curiosity seemed like an innocuous anxiety website it directed me to a test which then offered to send me indepth results via email no or I could get basic results which I clicked. Then a longass video with a woman promising she could cure me in just a few weeks no meds no therapy! It was really deceptive because the video suggested she would tell you the solution at any moment but eventually she asked for 78. It was an obvious scam to me and I knew that from the start but it was really well crafted. I doubt anyone here would fall for that sort of thing but if you see calm clinic in Google results click on the feedback button to report it as a scam. I think at one point the woman insinuated that if you thought the whole deal was too good to be true that also was your anxiety lol. Who tf can sleep at night after weedling mentally ill people for money?Anyway comes and goes but I've been getting this weird pressure headache generally around the crown and eyes. Often accompanied by a rushing in my ears that times with my heartbeat.

Im in my room and I can hear everyone laughing and joking and just having the time of their lives. Its so hard because I just want to be in my room watching my show and not having to talk or interact. It makes me feel like such an outsider. I dont know if Im making sense.

51695,Blood pressureHeartrate First time posting here. For context I suffer with anxiety obviously and also have bipolar and OCD parents. I find myself constantly obsessing over high blood pressure and high BPM. I'm a heavy set guy. I'm trying to be healthier but I have a long way to go on that. Sometimes hours of my day are spent stressing over whether my heart rate is too high and when I do so I find it usually makes it go higher. I hate going to the doctor because of it because I know my BP will be high and I don't want to know how high. Today I had to go to the doctor and ofc it was high but I was also having a panic attack while they were checking it because of the nerves I have around the whole thing and already had to walk 3 miles just to get there. I wasn't even there over my blood pressure. Anyway after the visit I was sobbing and hyperventilating the whole way home. I just don't know what to do. Obviously I have to get it under control but in the meantime I need to find some way not to obsess over it because it keeps triggering panic attacks.,Anxiety

35614,Maybe you do have a health condition but it's more likely to be benignchronic than whatever you're imagining I used to have bad health anxiety. Until I was diagnosed with POTS postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.What is POTS? At it's core it's an increase in heartrate when you're standing. To be diagnosed you need to have a standing heartrate that's 30bpm higher than your supine lying down heartrate.But what is POTS really? It's a complex condition of the autonomic nervous system. There are dozens of possible symptoms all somewhat benign ranging from heart palpitations to nausea to trouble regulating temperature. Some people with POTS aren't affected much while others are confined to a wheelchair because of their fainting spells. Yes it can be a terrible experience but it is not fatal.So why am I telling you guys this?Because there's a 100 conditions like POTS. Simple relatively harmless conditions that make you feel uncomfortable but pose no risk to your life. To name a few Raynauds disease intensely cold fingerstoes Fibromyalgia painaches in muscles Arthritis pain in bones Asthma difficulty breathing TMJ jaw pain headaches Crohn's disease abdominal pain gas diarrhea vomiting Cyclic vomiting disease recurring vomiting spells Ovarian cysts pain in pelvis back or side Hypothyroidism fatigue weight gain hair loss Anemia fatigue coldness Sleep apnea sleepiness snoringI'm not saying that it's easy to live with these conditions. No way. Most of them suck. HOWEVER they are not cancer they are not heart disease they are not multiple sclerosis.So when you're listing your symptoms focus on what the most probably cause. Neck pain? You probably have text neck. Stomachache? You probably ate something that your stomach doesn't agree with. Headache? You probably have some environmental or dietary trigger.rhealthanxiety is very near and dear to my heart. I spent many anxious nights terrified because of heart palpitations difficulty breathing muscle cramps. I can't tell you how much of a weight off my shoulders its been to have a diagnosis. I should've mentioned that the caused of my POTS is mitochondrial dysfunction which comes with another huge slew of symptomsI hope anyone here with an undiagnosed chronic condition can find a diagnosis and treatment asap. I know it's hard to keep your head on straight until that happens but try to! You are your best advocate.ampx200Bampx200B,Anxiety

51713,Anticipatory anxiety ruined my chance at a vacation. I'm so tired of trying to fly and failing. 28M.I've had a lifelong fear of flying that feel wellprepared to take headon especially the fear I've had around taxiing and takeoff. I've flown before but it's gotten harder to get through the process without running out of the airport dizzy panicked and overwhelmed by guilt in the past few years.Specifically I took a program called SOAR designed to help fearful flyers manage their fightflight responses around takeoff and aviophobia or fears when the plane is in the air. I felt confident in the last few weeks that I could do this. But as I lay on my side writing this I realize I was completely unprepared for the anticipatory anxiety ahead of the flight.I woke up at 4 am this morning in a cold sweat. My extremities were numb. I couldn't get a 10minute patch of sleep in without my stomach seemingly twisting into knots. The last 17 hours has been a waking nightmare of existing in a moderate to strong panic attack state. My appetite is nonexistent. I'm barely able to drink water. Every nerve in my body is screaming at me to tell my friends that I can't go on the spring break trip we planned.It's crazy I'm a grad student and I have never felt as tired as I do now just spending this day holding myself back from tears and a full breakdown. I'm so tired that a beach doesn't sound nice right now. I just want to curl up in my bedroom with no direct sunlight to sleep to cry to indulge in selfhatred for having a response this extreme to something so commonplace in life for a lot of people. A vacation is the one thing I need right now but trying to take one via flying has destroyed me. I'm lucky that I had nothing to do today because it was not going to get done. I don't know if this thread is a message in a bottle but it helps to get it out. If anyone has been in a similar situation I'd love to hear it.I still want to fly deaparately. It's one of the big things keeping me from living my life on my terms. But having to spend almost 48 hours in utter hell is not worth it.,Anxiety

34165,Anxiety or genuine heart condition? For the past year or so I have had crippling health anxiety with it all being related to my heart. The anxiety comes in waves and is usually when I am on my own and not keeping myself busy. The symptoms are so raw and debilitating that I sometimes genuinely think I have a undiagnosed heart condition. Common symptoms include the following Floatingsinking chest feeling Sudden twinges and sharp pierces that go after 12 seconds Increase in heart rate Cold shivers Restlessness have to get up and walk around Panic attacks Strange tingling an aching that is always on the left side of chest and resonates to left arm and shoulder blade Dizzinesslightheadednesss I have recently taken up running as a form of exercise three times a week to aid in the alleviation of these symptoms. More often than not this gives miraculous results and I feel fantastic after every run. Occasionally however the anxiety kicks in half way through the run and it is a real struggle to continue. Afterwards I have to sit down and try not to panic and think that my heart is going to give out on me. Is there anything I can do to combat this anxiety? I am planning to get a blood test and ECG done just to rule out any conditions. I am a 22 yo male with no family history of heart conditions. I have lightly smoked on and off between the ages of 1821 but quit around 4 months ago. Any help would be appreciated ,Anxiety

Anyways Im 25 now and I had my adrenal gland removed a few months ago due to a benign hormonesecreting adenoma. It was found via MRI in October. Not even a couple weeks after surgery I noticed extreme mental changes. Which led to paranoia. And then I lost 30lbs and stopped sleeping completely. I would get SO angry over shit that wasnt even important and I had to literally shut it down by cutting myself off from people. My hormones were a mess according to labs. I just KNEW something else was wrong.A week ago today I got an MRI which confirmed a brain tumor of the pituitary. I have to have my concerns because I work in the medical field and I usually know what something is the second it starts creeping up.

34678,Please give me some advice This all started about two months ago I went about 4 days without eating to help me lose weight. That Thursday I decided to start eating again so me and the family went to eat Mexican. I ate a small plate of fajitas not spicy. On the way home I felt my heart rate go WAY up and started pounding really hard. Then I started to feel like my chest was tight and I couldnt breathe properly and my hands and face began to get pins and needles. The pins and needles spread all over my body and I got this enormous pressure in my lower diaphragm. All of my joints locked up and I couldnt move. I could speak but it was slurred. They took me to the ER and after taking several tests including a EKG a CT scan of my brain and a battery of blood tests they concluded it was a low potassium level in my body which triggered a panic attack. Ok. So the next Tuesday I went to my primary care doctor for a follow up to check my potassium level and on the way I began to get that tingling and pressure in my chest again I pulled over got something to drink and made it to the doctors office. Potassium came back fine. The feeling didnt go away. All the rest of that day I felt like I couldnt breathe. The next day I went to a minor emergency center and after even more tests on my heart lungs and veins they concluded that I was fine and it was probably just anxiety. 3 days later. Went to the ER because the feeling still hasnt gone away and it is getting hard to live my life. Same thing a bunch of tests and concluded nothing. Doctor said it might be a ulcer in my stomach and put me on medication. One week later and it only got worse. I went back to the ER and they took even more extensive tests and still found nothing. I was desperate to feel better it had been two weeks of constant suffering. I went back to my primary doctor and he ordered more tests and a copy of the results from the ER. He found what appeared to be a hiatus hernia in my stomach and gave me a acid reducer. It has gotten better but still hasnt gone away. It has been almost two months since that Tuesday and I havent gotten even one minute of relief. My heart pounds constantly my stomach bloats Im always cold I have pain in my chest I cant take a deep breath and Im always tired. I feel like if someone cant help me Im going to die. I dont know if this was the right sub to post this on but nobody else will really listen to me. I have had worrys like Im having a heart attack. A few days ago I was helping my dad move a water tank. I got a scratch on my arm somehow. Afterwards something flew by my arm. Probably a large insect like a dragonfly but my mind immediately thought it was a rabid bat and it had just flew by and scratched me. A few days later I lay down to go to bed and I start feeling cold my heart starts pounding and I get scared and start googling. I had read a story about rabies on Reddit a while back that scared the shit out of me. I began reading the symptoms and convinced myself that I have only days to live. I dont believe rationally that I have rabies. My state has not had a human case in the last 30 years. But Im so damn scared and there is nothing I can do about it. Any advice to make me feel better?

34391,Just when I think I've made it I get pulled back in. I've had so many tests painful and otherwise over the past several weeks. After finally getting a nearly clean bill of health I brought up with my doctor the one thing I didn't think about until recently. I could feel a swollen lymph node just under my jaw over my carotid artery. what started to scare me is that i realized I could feel that lymph node for something like 3 months. My doctor immediately ordered an ultrasound and this morning I got a really somber call from a nurse at the Dr.'s office saying I needed to see an ENT right away I not only have the one but multiple enlarged lymph nodes in that area. My understanding is that the concern from my doctor is not just that there are multilple and they're enlarged at least one is on the order of 2cm but that at least one has persisted for so long and even more alarming I have no signs of an infection and my bloodwork is clean apparently persistent enlarged multiple lymph nodes with clean bloodwork is not a good sign.I've been freaking out all day and I've been trying to avoid the internet but the soonest I can get in to see an ENT is next Tuesday so I get to spend the next 4 days agonizing about this. I'm 38 years old and I've been through so many health symptom scares over the past couple of months mostly heart related that the anxiety is just making me lose my mind...,Anxiety

That plus my irregular eating habits and tendencies to skip meals puts me at risk for gallstonesI think.Last Sunday I noticed I had some really sharp pains on my right side under my ribcage. This isn't totally abnormal I have had this before but this time it was much sharper and deeper than normal. It lasted like a minute or so and happened a few more times but it wasn't anything seriousjust left me feeling a little chilly. But for whatever reason my brain was immediately thinking that's gallbladder pains and I got worked up. For the rest of the week I've been panicking every time i've had a pain or sensation in the areawhich has been fairly often making me wonder if it's psychosomatic or if something is actually wrong. I've had some pangs radiate into my shoulder and my arm as well convincing me even more it's my gallbladder and not me panicking. TMI but I also had some considerable gas and bloating throughout the week and I woke up more nauseous than normal most morning and I've had indigestion and stomach pains a bit after eating as well. I stopped eating stuff with a lot of fat and sugar in hopes that I wouldn't have an attack worse than what I experienced Sundayin fact I cut out fat almost completely I've been too afraid to eat it.I went for a checkup on Thursday and my doctor ordered bloodtests and an ultrasound on my upper right quadrant. I haven't gotten the results yet but I got a call from someone at the clinic a day after about information that my doctor wanted to share with me but it went to voicemail and when I called back immediately after they never answeredjust to add to my worry!And now to add even more to my worry my urine is darker than normal which is another sign of gallbladder dysfunction I've read about...though I did have beets for lunch...I've been panicking about this for an entire week and I know it's nothing to really be stressed over...I've changed my diet as much as I could and I'm getting everything taken care of but I'm terrified of having another attack or something awry happening in between now and my blood resultsultrasound. And I'm scared for many reasons of having my gallbladder out...I've never had major surgery and I've heard about chronic digestive issues people have after they get it removed...thought that definitely sounds better than having an infected gallbladder explode inside of you.Just wanted to vent...I've had to keep myself off of the internet because I kept psyching myself out more and more and I think it may have ended up giving me more symptoms. I've been so doom and gloom over this and I normally can convince myself to relax even when I'm worried about something being wrong with me but this time I haven't been. Don't know if it's intuition or what.,Anxiety
345,I get traumatized. when he was a child he was said to be ugly because he had a mole. When I grew up around high school I was also said to be ugly with a guy.

35581,Masturbated too much 2 weeks ago It was hard to properly explain what is wrong right now in just the title so hopefully this whole post isnt too graphic. About 2 weeks ago I masturbated dry way too much and I injured myself and my ejaculate was slightly pink and i had groin pain. I rested and put ice in my groin area that night and a week later I felt better. I ejaculated again and it looked fine but there was a weird piece of something it looked kind of like old dry blood it was dark red and tiny. It happened again recently about another week apart and now Im freaking out. Did I injure myself really badly? Should I see a professional? Or just wait longer than I am again to heal properly? I cant find anything like this online so Im freaking out. Please help.,Anxiety
34722,Cant do this anymore. As the title says I really cant do this anymore living with anxiety and health anxiety isnt even living its basically existing. Its got to the point that its changing who I am as a person Ive become jealous of people for being able to just live their lives I feel like Im becoming a bad mum and partner through it and Ive decided its time for a change. Instead of going to the doctor for yet more tablets Ive decided to overcome it myself eating better sleeping better avoiding alcohol Ive realised this does not help at all it helps while Im drinking and then the next day is hell avoiding caffeine and exercising and reading more. Ive started playing the sims on my phone just to keep my mind active and on something other than my health or whatever strange worry my mind decides to have that day. Ive decided enough is enough and Im going to push myself to do things I would never usually do and get better. Sorry for the moaning boring post but sometimes it feels good to get it out to people who actually know how you feel and wont just say youll be alright Also a great app Ive found is called Dare its absolutely brilliant for panic attacks and has really helped me the last few days.

35435,I have an appointment with yet another specialist next week and I feel like it's not even worth it because my symptoms are probably all in my head. I have had so many little health issues over the years that I worked up with my anxiety. Googling things constantly always asking the doctor about every little thing. Every single damn time I end up at a specialist and get a bunch of expensive tests just to find out nothing's wrong. It's all in my head. I have an appointment with an allergist next week to find out what caused a bad reaction... But now all I can think is that the reaction was not real. It was probably just a panic attack. I'm sure all the tests will come back normal again and I'll be left with regret and a big bill as I'm reminded that I'm still just a hypochondriac.,Anxiety

35559,13 trips to the hospital from 2018present went to the ER last night. Near trips to the hospital Almost daily. Hey guysI am really suffering in a way that makes life absolute torture. I have health problems however they're compounded significantly by my constant fears of death and cardiovascularheartrelated health anxiety. Does anyone here ever feel like suicide is rational when your life has been distilled to daily panic attacks of the worst kind and constant thinkingfears of sudden death or further disability i.e. strokes fatal arrythmias heart failure etc.I don't want to die I fear the unknown so intensely however I feel that I deserve dignity and mercy for my situation.

52333,Does Studying Trigger Extreme Anxiety? I have this real weird thing that happens to me.So besides my work life I have potential academic plans. I love studying reading writing. I have so many ambitions with all these things I want to write. I might even publish them. I spend a lot of timeeffort on these studies I do on my personal life.The weird thing is whenever I go into focused studying the idea that I will die anyways comes to my mind. I start to feel like this effort is for nothing that I will die eventually maybe even soon. I read about these scholars of the past and see that some of them died so young. What will all this information help me with if I am going to die anyways? Will I have enough time to categorizeinterpretpublish so much knowledge?Anyways lots of anxious thoughts suddenly rush to my mind about mortality. I had this back in uni as well. I remember when I studied a lot during my masters I would always start thinking about my mortality and whether all the work I do is even worth it....Is there a scientific explanation to this? Why would studying in a focused manner put me in such an existential crisis each time?ampx200Bnote I use escitalopram for GADPanic,Anxiety

34071,Flu Fear! Oh boy. It's DEFINITELY that time of the year. The time of year to search all over the internet for articles on flu statistics and reading through the sad cases of people who were killed by it and subsequently sending yourself into a spiral of anxiety when you remember the fact that you did not get your flu shot this year.I've never gotten the flu. I haven't gotten the shot in a few years too I believe. My doctor asked me if I wanted it a few months ago but I foolishly said no at the time because I was in a rush to leave. Boy do I regret it now.I go back to college in about 2 weeks and I am stressed. I suppose it's not too late to go get it but that doesn't quell my anxiety over the fact it's only 10 effective anyway. Jeez.TLDR I'm afraid I'm going to be one of those rare cases of someone dying of the flu. I need to stop reading. I'm hoping for some solidarity here. Does anyone else have this fear especially considering this season is supposedly very bad?,Anxiety

My anxiety is extremely physical I just felt like I had a literal heart attack.

34472,Worried I have worms in my brains among other bizarre health anxieties. For the past several months I've been on a huge parasite scare that came out of seemingly nowhere. I even had stool samples taken again several months ago and everything came back negative. But now I'm thinking maybe the samples weren't great. Apparently they do their testing kind of hastily sometimes so I'm thinking of doing a second batch of samples.Anyway... I always thought that tapeworms were just an intestinal parasite. But then I read that they can spread to other organs too including your EYES and BRAINS. Christ. So naturally I look in the mirror every day to make sure there aren't any worms in my eyes. I also check my stool with every bowel movement. And now I'm worried that the larvae of this hypothetical worm has spread to my lungs I've been coughing a lot lately and brains as well would explain my headaches and why I feel so spaced out.I've also had to take my cat to the vet a couple times because she was diagnosed with diabetes so naturally I'm worried about fleas as well now. I just saw some kind of small brown bug on my floor one of my cats spotted it that bounced around a couple times before I killed it. Now it could've just been a moth that was struggling to fly but it could've also been a flea. Right? And infected fleas carry feline tapeworms that are even worse than regular tapeworms if they spread to humans.So yeah it's 3 AM and I'm going over all of this shit in my head unable to sleep.I guess I should mention I'm also worried about going blind as my astigmatism has been getting worse and I found out about something called keratoconus which I may have and I also have all kinds of pains in my body around pancreas and liver especially so I could also have cancer. Or maybe those are just the cysts formed by the larvae of the tapeworm.And I do also worry about earlyonset dementia and stuff like that but that's kind of taken a backseat while 90 of my mental energy goes into worrying about worms.,Anxiety
35109,Health Anxiety I have fears that I'm going to suddenly go crazy. I have been experiencing smells that I can't explain. I'm just wondering if any of you guys have had this e.g cigarette smoke and toast.Any feedback would be super appreciated.,Anxiety
34558,Change in stool? First post here! I know it's gross but I've noticed what I would call a significant change in my stool within maybe the last year. I don't go nearly as often and sometimes when I do it feels like it's very little or there's more in my body that I can't get out. I think that's kind of normal since I'm a 24yearold female and I know my metabolism has to slow down at some point but I feel uncertain about it. On top of that I have noticed a little bit of blood in my stool. I've have had trouble with hemorrhoids in the past so I'm pretty positive that's got to be what the blood is coming from. On top of THAT I've also noticed an increasing amount of mucus in my stool which I feel like my body may be producing to make up for my possible constipation. Anyway it worries me because I know colon cancer is becoming more prevalent in adults my age. In addition I'm not overweight but I have a history of eating poorly which I know can lead to colon cancer.I'm definitely going to pass this information along to my physician the next time I see her I guess I just wanted to see what someone might say here first. ,Anxiety
34178,Can I get the flu from this? I had the flu a month ago and never want to get it again. But I went to the RMV and took a vision test and had to put my whole face in the little box.

I think all the years of stress of engineering school have finally gotten to me. Between internships and summer classes I havent gotten much of a break. Winter breaks do help but Ive noticed that the recharged feeling I have after has lasted less and less after each one. I know Im almost to senior year and itll get easier but Im just really overwhelmed. I shouldnt be feeling this stressed all the time. Having so much anxiety has made me feel down.

35122,Intestinal anxiety I'm a 27 year old male I don't smoke in any capacity nor do I do any drugs or drink alcoholic drinks in any capacity. I'm not on any medications and have no pre existing illnesses.Last year I had a pretty large bowel movement large enough that I couldn't pass it without manipulating my anus with my hand to ease the log out since then I've been having blood in my stools on toilet paper and inon feces the blood is red not sure if it's dark red but it's definitely not black. I have no pain associated with passing a stool at all which is slightly comforting I guess...Shortly after the blood started showing up last year I took myself to the ER and explained what was happening after getting a finger up my ass I was told it was most likely hemorrhoids. Not to long after visiting the ER the blood in my stool disappeared and I was relieved now after roughly a year ish later it's shown up again and been off and on for about a month still no pain associated with having bowel movements just anxiety.For the record I have no loss of appetite no weight loss and no fatigue out of the ordinary. I have no direct family with a history of colorectal cancer.,Anxiety
52692,Magnesium for anxietyrelated heart palpitations? I have heart palpitations that Ive been to a cardiologist about for years and have always been told theyre just a result of anxiety. I hear of people having heart palpitations during panic attacks or while feeling anxious but I have them all day everyday no matter how calm or regular the moment is. I suppose underlying anxiety is still there as Im a jittery person naturally. But theyre annoying and distracting. I tried a beta blocker but it did absolutely nothing my cardiologist says anxiety meds might help but Im nervous to take any pills I dont have to.I heard magnesium helps with heart palpitations but I know nothing about it how much is good versus bad what form to take it in etc any info is appreciated!

35248,Please help Orthorexia health anxiety veganism and internet quacks Hi there ampx200BI experience health anxiety and orthorexia I have a really unhealthy relationship with food and my health anxiety revolves extremely around food. However I have spent so much money on tests and seeing doctos and am at my wits end. Every health test I have had through a legitimate NHS doctor gastroenterologist and specialist I have been told I have nothing to stress about. I had a blood test for pernicious anemia a full blood count test for everything a stool test through the gastroenterologist. My worry now is that I have SIBO or some weird gut disease. I am also vegan. However I am worried that I am being misled by internet quacks who want to sell fake or bullshit health tests out of desperation a few weeks ago i bought and took an organic acids test and it cost 256 and the online nutrition coach who sells the test recommends I take a SIBO test so i can know if I have it but im concerned ill just be given a false positive which will further amp up my health anxiety and orthorexia. I even spent 300 on a mercury tritest because I was worried I had mercury poisoning from fillings Which I now recognise as untrue and a very common case of health quackery. I spent 200 on 'viome' where you send a stool sample and its completely bogus. I dont know what to do i'm obsessed with the idea that my anxiety is linked to my gut health even though I dont have any of the genuine symptoms of SIBO. I'm just sick of being obsesseed with my health and the food I eat. it had got to the point where I lost a stone and weighed 4951kg as a 21 year old male at 56. ampx200BIf anyone can relate to this please feel free to reach out or give some advice.ampx200BThank you ,Anxiety

35570,Unsubscribing today. Thanks for all of your support. This sub has helped me through a lot of health concerns but today I'm finally in a place where I can deal with it on my own so I'm posting to hopefully help someone else.I started off as a mess and eventually got a full heartbody checkup including an MRI and wore a heart monitor for 24hours to check out my palpitations. After being told that everything is fine that was a big step. Getting a professional comprehensive medical diagnosis to rule out what you're worried about goes a long way. After chest pains numbness tingling in my limbs dizzy spells being sent to the ER because urgent care thinks I might be having a stroke and a ton of other shit something outside my control changed my stress level. I took on a different role at work that is much less stressful. I had no idea how big of an impact this was because I didn't consider myself stressed but several symptoms subsided with this change like everything digestive and the chest pain is less frequent. After I was told the chest pains are costochondritis inflammation of the rib tissues read stressinduced I saw a chiropractor for about 5 months who taught me some stretches and selfadjustments I could do with a back roller and now I've trained myself not to panic when I feel those chest pains. Just do the stretches and trust that I'm fine and sure enough I am. Also my doctor told me to cut caffeine and I didn't listen. I am a coffee junkie and cut back but didn't cut it out entirely. Well recently I switched to decaf I know stick with me and it's been lifechanging. Yes this is obvious. Yes we all know caffeine raises your physiological arousal level. But many of us keep consuming caffeine not realizing just how much it actually contributes to the cycle. I'm a much happier person on decaf and I don't think I'll go back. I found out all of the shit I was dealing with can be caused by anxiety. So this whole time it was the fear of a health problem that was causing health problems. Stress impacts us more than we realize!So to recap here are the things my dumb ass put off doing forever that really made a huge impactGet a doctor's opinion. As in a thorough one if possible instead of just a quick visit. They will run some tests and give you a professional take on it. When you get this TRUST IT. If you have reason to believe the doctor missed something get a second opinion but really you should trust the doctor.Manage your external stress. This doesn't mean quit your job but if something is stressing you out a situation at work a significant other family take some real steps to get out of that situation! In my case it was a lateral transfer and a change in responsibilities but man did it lower my stress levels.Cut the caffeine and any other stimulants including recreational ones. If you struggle with anxiety your brain is already pumping you full of stress hormones in a fightorflight response. You absolutely do not to make it worse. Even a little can impact some people like me apparently.For the love of Reddit never Google your symptoms.The terrible thing about anxiety is once it has you it's a downward spiral. But the inverse is true too. Once you are confident in your situation and know the quirks of your own body you can come out of it quickly too. Hope this helps someone.,Anxiety

51649,Dry heaving Ive been dealing with a really complex personal issue involving heartbreak loss of a person I deeply care about certainly the worst pain Ive experienced in my life thus far. As it stands I already carry a level of anxiety with me but with this added on to it my body has been putting me through hell. I find myself dry heaving hard in the mornings especially and then at times throughout the day. This has led to some really painful vomiting on several occasions. Its also occurred at my workplace the gym and several other public places without warning. I know theres absolutely a psychosomatic part of all of this but after almost three weeks its becoming really problematic for me. Has anyone experienced something similar?

34207,Someone please help First of all I urge anyone who reads this to please give an opinion on what they think it may be I'm worried sick. Thanks in advance.Ok i've made posts about things I've felt before but somehow everything I had 2 weeks ago is now gone and has been replaced by new fears.I'll get straight to it here are symptoms with context Odd feeling on left side of body mainly legs only when laying or sitting. Feels like weakness but I can still walk just fine and feel no difference in balance. Sort of like fatigue without any actual excercise to cause it really odd and it scares me. Tinnitus already diagnosed 2 years ago with bilateral tinnitus and it's got easier to deal with. But in times like these it makes me feel awful. I'm aware of the recent progresses in Tinnitus treatment so it doesn't worry me too much as it's benign and only sounds when i'm in silence. Constipation probably caused by the stress or anxiety. Either way it might be causing me problems. Intermittent sharp stomach pains on the left side of my abdomen under ribs I called the doctor about it and he said it was nothing lethal or worrying but to get it checked out anyway. That my current worst fear that I had a digestive infection caused by the constipation. A feeling that for some reason I'm going to die tomorrow from some lethal random attack of sorts like my intestines will rupture from a tiny stomach pain or that I'll have a heart attack because I can sometimes hear pounding in my head. That's the worst of all of this the never being able to relax I feel on edge 247. Researching everything that I can in order to reassure myself only to find an even worse disease that vaguely correlates to my symptoms.I always feel the urge to check my speech to see if it's slurred or check my heartrate to check for palpitations or check my typing to check for strokeALS. I seriously can't keep living like this why do I keep getting these physical symptoms?!Many thanks Max,Anxiety
52119,Coming to terms with anxiety as an adult looking back it was pretty obvious and nobody talked about it. Hi friends new poster here. Turns out my entire family suffers from anxiety and nobody shared this with me. My mom was medicated for it briefly my dad is medicated for it and also has PTSD and it runs in both sides of the family. I figured it out in my early 20's and I have been seeing all these things about myself in a new light ever since. Currently suspicious that I might have ocd.Something I am frustrated with is that I had a lot of signs and symptoms but was quieter than my siblings so it got brushed off all the time. In highschool I had one friend and she was always telling me I was a worrywart and openly mocked me about things I did. For example I could never just cross a street. Had to be with the walk signal and then I would RUN across it and one day she made a big deal about it to my faceNobody ever asked WHY. Why I had almost no friends why I didn't learn to drive until I was almost 30 why I am always going around giving people warnings about their safety. One time I had a complete breakdown after my parents got divorced which was very rare for me. And my mom said she's just being dramatic and wants attention and that was the end of that. I was also the responsible one. They just don't have time for my feelings.I try to talk to my dad who seems like the person who would understand the most and I'll say I have been figuring out some stuff about driving and being anxious and he will go SPEAKING OF ANXIETY AND DRIVING YOUR SISTER HAS COME ALONG SO FAR IN HER DRIVING! Or I will try to tell him I think I might have ocd and he will use this tone of disbelief and try to poke holes in what I'm saying to him.Sorry for the long post. I'm just grateful that sometimes I can find places on the internet to talk about it. I don't have the worst anxiety in the world but it's always there all the time.

52322,Not sure if I want to go to a friend's wedding One of my mates has invited me to his wedding and I'm not sure if I want to go.I really appreciate the invite and we were really good mates years ago but since 2018 I've not seen him too much since he moved away.The wedding is a good 7 hour drive away and I don't think I'll know many people at all. Just maybe two or three other mates I've met before but no one else. I don't have a plus one or anyone to go with.I'm feeling a bit anxious about it and don't want to be a bad friend or let him down by saying no but I have a feeling that if I go I'll feel really awkward. Will be a lot of his and her family and I'll just be there not knowing anyone really at all. Also it's gonna be quite an expense in accommodation and travel expenses.

34506,Anxiety over oral cancer A little over a week ago I noticed that I was having some pain in my mouth when eating so I looked to see that I have what looks like a bit of red bumplump in the upper back corner. I've been brushing and rinsing it out with mouth wash for almost a week and while it feels like it's gotten somewhat better it still hasn't gone away and still have this kinda heavy like feeling on the side of my mouth.I'm starting to now have anxiety it could be something more serious like oral cancer. I do brush and rinse regularly and smoked smoked socially but quit earlier this year. I'm only in my early twenties so the chance of it being something serious isn't likely but it's still freaking me out. I would go to a dentist but I am at college in a really small town and there isn't one here as far as I know and I don't know if a regular doctor would be able to do much.

I had a bit of a sore throat waking up on Sunday but nothing too serious thought not too much of it as I was settling down for bed I noticed a bit of a rash on my chest which sent me to immediate panic. Fast forward to Monday and I have a full body rash and getting a lot of chills in the nights and when I wasnt medicated in the day I was pretty worried something was seriously wrong with me so organised an appointment with the doctor today. I went in and the doctor did a few tests on me Checked my throat tongue Ears chest back and my blood pressure and then told me Im sorry to tell you this but Im afraid you have scarlet fever I had no idea what it was until looking online after but surprised a 20 year old like myself has got it as its usually only children who get it to my understanding. I asked the doctor again and she confidently said that it was scarlet fever. Im on a set of antibiotics for 10 days now and have been told it should hopefully get a lot better within the next two days.... has anyone else ever encountered it? And do you think I should trust my doctors opinion I always have a fear that it may be something worse.Thanks,Anxiety

34028,Cant tell if panic attack or allergic reaction. Please help. So I have what I think is the common cold and decided to take Mucinex DM. After I took it I noticed there werent any effects listed on the package at all so I looked it up online. Well it says the most severe side effect is chest tightnessdifficulty breathing. I was kinda already having chest tightness before I looked that up. Reading that made it even worse. The reason I cant tell if its panic or not is because I started getting bad anxiety after reading about the flu epidemic and how it caused death and stuff. This was all after taking it. This is also my first time ever taking Mucinex DM. Everything is just making my feelings worse and I dont know what to do. My main anxietypanic symptoms are chest tightness short breaths and nausea. It said on the website to go to the ER but Im too scared to and cant afford it at all. Im also worried its just my anxiety and that Ill end up going for no reason. ,Anxiety

I've seen earlier a post about colon cancer anxiety so I decided to blow off some steam by telling my story.It all started last summer when I had a weird pain in my left abdominal area. Went to my GP said it was nothing but that I should have a blood test I was 20 at the time. I found out I had an important Calcium deficiency and after I took some supplements the pain disappeared. Fast forward to last week that pain came back exactly in the same spot. Now I'm going once or sometimes even twice a day compared to my usual routine of once in two days. The pain fades away after bowel movements and that put me at ease for a couple of days but today I saw in a stool some darkbrownish spots which I believed to be blood.This has gone too far. I have no idea what I should do but I want to get out from this dumb situation. I don't enjoy life the way I used to because of some stupid thoughts.,Anxiety

I didn't learn about BSEvCJD until a few months ago. I feel disgusting. The only beef I really ever ate was ground beef whether it's from the store or from taco bell or some other burger joint. I ate ground beef frequently and carelessly. I have tiny muscle twitches frequently at night and it perpetuates my fear. What do you think the odds are that the beef I ate contained BSE?

52514,every strange thing thats happened in the last 24 hours. please read . 14M. As a bit of background I am currently in therapy for anxiety depression OCD and for the last six weeks i have been on 50mg of sertraline a day and 2 lots of 20mg promethazine a day. since yesterday morning i havent felt great but i atleast thought that the medication was working . was feeling depressed a bit the night before but something was drastically different.I woke up and felt like i was incoherent but i wasnt and began to feel very depressed. i put it down to just a bad day and i read online sertraline can cause depressive feelings . i continued on with my day not worrying until the nighttime . just before i was going to get into bed something didnt feel right. i started to feel strange in ways i cant describe and I had these 1 second headaches in the same spot every 510 minutes . my memory then began to feel weird and i checked my blood pressure which was normal. I then grabbed my playstation controller and headset and put it by my bedside which i never do . i always leave it on my desk. this freaked me out but then again that could just be down to tiredness .I got into bed and checked by blood pressure again. all normal. but something didnt feel right at all. it felt like i was living in yesterday and then i suddenly got this strange feeling and this is the best way of describing it it felt like I wasnt conscious but i was at the same time . like to recall my memory it feels like none of that happened except it did . the world felt deaf and it felt like time was no longer linear . i felt as if i couldnt process things properly if at all. and thought brain bleed.I then went to the bathroom and felt panicked but didnt show it . I checked my pupils and they were fine . i then went back to my bedroom and began to text people ok reddit for advice and said it all sounds like anxiety. at this point my brain was telling me that I was forgetting something but i dont know what because thats the whole point of forgetting something . I began to feel like I was in a delirious state and i felt as if i couldnt hang on to a thought process. I was worried as this was not normal for me so i woke up my dad and told him what was happening . at this point when I was trying to read something i searched up on google the words looked jumbled and i had to read it again. this has never been an issue before and i certainly dont have dyslexia so this made me worry .I explained to my dad that the way I was feeling was not normal so i asked him if I could call 111 urgent care number . I explained to them my situation and i was put on call later to a man who literally asked my father what he thought he should do if i was feeling delirious . at this point i realised it was pointless . he basically said it sounds like nothing physically but i disagreed. Exhausted of all my options i decided to go to sleep. I got around 7 hours and slept straight through and had vivid detailed dreams .I woke up around 11am after going to bed around 4am. I still had memory troubles but not nearly as bad as the night before . I tried to convince myself I was fine and realised i still felt strange and the letters looked a bit jumbled still. Ive tried to brush it off all day but still feeling weird. a recent feeling in the past 67 hours ive attained is the feeling like im waking up and suddenly realising im doing something while im doing it subconsciously . but if i backtrack and i try to remember it all feels fine. just not in the moment. this is the thing that is freaking me out . any advice please ? any at all? does this sound like a brain bleed mental confusiondelirium? or could this be explained by anxiety derealization tiredness? so scared honestly dont know what to do.,Anxiety
52647,Is it anxiety and over thinking? Or is it intuition? How to know the difference? My partner has lied to me in the past and now anything that is remotely close to that topic makes me think hes lying. And then I spiral and think I have to check his phone then I think he deleted messages then I need to check his Apple Watch and then I think he may have used another form of contact and I start to feel like maybe Im being illogical and crossing the line. In the moment I feel like nothing can give me relief except for finding solid proof. Im not proud of this behavior. I recently started therapy for my overall anxiety. Unfortunately it is hard to afford to have sessions often enough. Context He lied 1.5 years ago about something relating to a female coworker it was not infidelity. After lying he was able to prove he was telling the truth. I feel 99 confident about it. Since then he lied about about small things like not playing video games while on the phone. Idk I dont want to damage my relationship with this but I also dont want to be lied to again and turn a blind eye. So how can I know if I am acting because of anxiety and overthinking opposed to following intuition and following my gut. My intuition is how I caught his initial lie.,Anxiety

It started to subside somewhat after I got a scan done after I felt a lump it was just a cyst. Right around that time I was also immigrating from the UK to the US so my life got super busy and the health anxiety virtually went away. Ive been in the US for almost two years now and havent really had any big health worries since I got the scan done in England years ago...until this week. My wife passed onto me I guess some sort of virus and I had flu like symptoms of course a lymph node on my neck has swollen as is pretty topical with stuff like that and Im now convinced I have lymphoma. 0 to 60 in about a week unbelievable. This time feels different though when this sort of stuff happened in the past my rational thought was completely obscured to the point where any logical or rational thought would immediately be dismissed in favor of the worst case scenario but this time Im well aware how irrational Im being and Im well aware that its most likely just due to this infection.

Now Im prone to tonsil stones and noticed a bit come out but the feeling was still there. It almost feels as though one is lodged deep and I cant get to it or see it. Additionally Ive had some dull ear pain off and on. I went to urgent care and the doctor got out a tiny bit of something in the back of my throat but it didnt resolve it completely. She said my throat looked healthy but I still worry she missed something. Today I made the stupid mistake of checking my throat for the billionth time and noticed a white patch In the back of my throat and went down a google spiral. I feel so anxious its hard to function.

35860,Possible explanation for brain fog headaches fatigue dizziness with normal labimaging findings Hi allI really hope this doesn't stir up more anxiety for anyone but I have a possible explanation for some of the symptoms that often pop up here especially for the folks that think they have a brain tumor. When the bones of the neck are not in proper alignment a lordotic curve whether from past trauma e.g. whiplash repetitive micro trauma or poor posture it can cause a bunch of symptoms that a lot of people are attributing to brain tumors headaches dizziness vision issues brain fog fatigue etc.. A formal xrayCTMRI report will not usually comment on an absent lordotic curve if there is nothing pathologically wrong bone spurs herniations etc. with the vertebrae or disc space but a nonlordotic curve does cause real symptoms. I came across this information through physiochiro so if you're someone that slouches and has migraines and headaches try keeping your chin tucked in don't stay in awkward positions take breaks from computer work drink water get a comfortable pillow and keep your shoulders rolled back. I know not everyone's issues are related to this but it may be worth a try if your medical tests all came back negative but you're still experiencing symptoms.,Anxiety

35035,Need some Help Was doing so good too. Hey guys! I was doing so good it had been weeks that I had finally got over my HA for the most part. However today I went down the anxiety spiral again. I was itching my back and decided to look at my moles since they seemed to be itchy. Nothing too crazy just a few itches. I've read about melanoma before and kind of disregarded it because although I have a good 60 moles none of them showed signs of melanoma. Recently I have been getting some new moles which isn't that crazy in itself but there seemed to be a lot more popping up. So anyway I unfortunately got on the Google and did some research on different types of melanoma and what to look for than preceded to check myself. I noticed two somewhat suspect moles. One is slight redbrown and the other one appears to be a kinda line. I read that linear melanoma are of the types and it looks a little similar. I'm freaking out because I don't have health insurance and don't think I can pay for a dermatologist out of pocket since I'm somewhat young and on a fixed income. Any advice on how I can handle this or anything I can do to ease my anxieties?,Anxiety

35363,anxiety about having a personality disorder Recently I've become obsessed with the possibility of having borderline personality disorder. I have a decent amount of the associated symptoms but I also have bipolar disorder which complicates things. I've been hospitalized for mania so I'm pretty confident that's not a misdiagnosis my worry is I have BPD on top of it.I now spend hours reading the criteria for BPD taking BPD symptom tests over and over again reading accounts of BPD on medicalmental health subreddits to see if my experiences fit. It's even more hellish than health anxiety I've had about physical health problems because there is no definitive test one professional could say I have it and the other could disagree for example there is no objective qualification for whether I have it and I'm scared to even bring it up to a professional because I don't want to plant the seed in their mind and be treated worse because it's so highly stigmatized. It's gotten completely obsessive. I'm really unsure of what to do. ,Anxiety

34750,Terrified of catching the flu after ENT visit. I've been a huge germaphobe for as long as I can remember. In the spring and summer it usually doesn't cause me to much distress but once cold and flu season pick up it starts to have a greater impact on my mental health and my ability to function. Earlier today I had my biyearly appointment with my ENT to get my ears cleaned out I produce a ton of wax. I was super anxious going into the appointment as there is a very bad cold going around my area right now and the flu is widespread. I took hand sanitizer with me and was prepared to grab a mask if the waiting room was busy. Thankfully there wasnt a single patient in the waiting room. I was called back quickly the nurse took some info I sanitized my hands and then my ENT entered the room. He shook my hand and then sanitized his and got to work cleaning me out. Once he finished I asked a quick question about how to avoid facial and ear pain on a long flight and he suggested the vasalva maneuver. He demonstrated it for me and then asked me to try it. Ordinarily I dont touch my face under any circumstances but since I had just sanitized my hands and since I was just pinching the outside of my nose I was careful not to get too close to my nostrils I figured it would be okay. So I pinched my nose very briefly and went on my way. On the drive home I started to think about it a bit more and realized that after I sanitized my hands I shook his hand so my hands probably were not very clean when I pinched my nose shut. And I started to get really worried that in doing so I probably exposed myself to tons of coldflu germs that will infect me in the coming days. Now I'm anxious as can be trying to find some rational reason why I shouldn't be worried here so I can calm down a bit. I havent had any luck yet. Can anybody help me out here? Also just for the record I'm seeing a therapist twice a week to help with these things. We just started back in October but unfortunately he's been out of town all of December for the holidays. I've backtracked a good bit in his absence. I'm also more anxious than usual about getting sick because I have a vacation coming up next week and I really dont want to have a coldflu while traveling. ,Anxiety

34344,Testicular Cancer I'm like 90 sure I have testicular cancer.. basically around 3 months ago i got a sharp pain in my testicle immediately I got worried as I never have pain there.. so I looked it up and saw testicular cancer I was shaking etc. The next day or so I was experiencing symptoms of testicular cancer.. like abdominal pain chest pain etc almost every day for like 1 and a half months so fast forward January I went to the ER because the chest pains were pretty bad same with abdominal pain etc. They did an EKG chest xray and a nurse did a physical exam on me.. so for the EKG my heart rate was kinda high also my blood pressure was high but it always has been so not really worried then I had a Chest XRay after I did that and got the results back saying all clear.. my chest pain stopped like 10 minutes later still had abdominal pain tho they did a blood test which also came back good but TC can't be detected in a common blood test. After that I got a physical exam and testicular exam the testicular exam the nurse only examined the sides and front.. by the way I have a lump on the top of my testicle didn't really tell her about it though but she said everything seemed fine.So still almost everyday I worry that I have TC.. i'm scared they could of missed something on the Chest XRay. I'm thinking about going back to the ER soon and getting a testicular ultrasound. Also right now i'm having headaches fever and my necks been hurting when I move it for about a week.. Could all of this be Health Anxiety? As some of the symptoms still persist when i'm not anxious or not thinking about it. I've also felt tired and fatigued lately.I'm 15 years old by the way.,Anxiety

35080,would my may2018 ECG of picked this up? worried! so yesterday I was drilling some wood and I out of nowhere felt a dul pain in my left arm and chest I think it was brought on by putting arm in or moving it in specific positions and when I took a breath my left side of chest hurt! it went on like for a few seconds and the simptoms subsided but sometimes if I take a deep breath or lay in some positions it hurts the arm or chest but if I am just sitting still on my computer it doesn't hurt I read about silent hart attacks and this caused me to have my anxiety spiral out of controle again! If there was anything wrong in my heart would it of showed up on my ECG or is it possible that this could be something new? I keep worrying but I haven't let this whole thing keep me from enjoying my day. I had my ECG in may of 2018 when my anxiety had spiraled out of controle over some palpitations that were 99.9 attributed to eating too many of those chocolate easter eggs. What I notice from the new simptoms though is that the pains are very intermittent and come and go like sometimes I will feel some chest pain if I take a deep breath sometimes if I raze my arm or hold it a certen way etc I was able to get a good night's sleep but still worrying about the whole possibility of some undetected heart thing or a potentially dangerous problem.

35424,Hard lump in penis and doctor diagnosed as a cyst with no ultrasound or biopsy I discovered a hard lump in the middle of my penis. It seems pretty deepinternal like close to the urethra and not close to the skin. I have no pain and no symptoms except a minor case of vitiligo loss of skin pigmentation on my penis that started developing within the last year. No STDs. I saw my doctor and I feel like he brushed it off too easily. He said it's most likely a cyst showed me a picture of an epidermoid cyst during his explanation and said he just wants to monitor it followup in 6 months and take no further action no ultrasound biopsy etc. My medical record was updated to say it's a cyst.It's the VA and I don't know what their deal is but I guess they try hard to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures. I just don't view it as unnecessary and expected him to order an ultrasound. I pushed back a little said it felt like gambling the doc responded by saying the odds are against anything serious like penile cancer I'm too young 31 and further action is unnecessary. On top of that it's a resident who saw me who had to confer with an attending for guidancefinal approval and the attending never saw me. The resident seemed inclined to order an ultrasound until he spoke to the attending who put the kibosh on that.I acknowledge the odds of cancer are low I just wonder what would happen if they encountered someone who had a genuine case of earlystage penile or urethral cancer. They'd be less likely to catch it at an early stage because they'd wait until it's symptomatic by bleeding or blocking the urethra etc. The potential negative consequences for them are nil and the patient is the one who would be subjected to a penectomy or worse if it turned out they were too complacent. What a nightmare that would be.Does my irritation seem justified or am I making too big a deal of it?,Anxiety
34223,Pretty bad anxiety towards taking meds with a possibility to prolong QT. Help. Warning this post got much MUCH longe r than I anticipated. Sorry to however actually reads this entire essay.So I have a psychiatrist who recently prescribed me sertraline for chronic depressionptsd and trazodone for sleep but I actually haven't taken either. This specific phobia started like 11 12 yrs ago I think. I had walking pneumonia a few weeks ago and absolutely had to take antibiotics and Holy shit my anxiety was thru the roof every time I was time to take it. I was absolutely convinced my QT interval was significantly prolonged and I was going to die in my sleep! I feel like I narrowly escaped death after I finished the course. Which is ridiculous.I have had ekgs countless times probably like over 10 times ftr I'm only 18 and only started getting them in the last two years and for the most part were completely 100 normal shocker.... excluding this one time during my purging like 3x a day and keeping literally nothing down phase where my hearts repolarization phase fucked beyond belief.Actually I'm just going to talk about that a little because the anxiety still plagues me. my heart was physically rattling shaking in my chest with every beat like it was unsure of how to beat normally. it was incredibly scary I think I experienced what I believe was possibly a very brief arrhythmia. at first I thought it may have been a minor seizure which wouldn't be that unrealistic as purging electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia. sleep deprivation I had stayed up all night physical activity while literally running on empty we were inside playing basketball when it all started and of course hypoglycemia essentially noteating will do that to ya all lower the seizure threshold and also how i might have had a seizure once back when I was abusing dxm constantly which of course predisposes you to future seizures because of how disoriented I got and how everything became slow motion almost similar to the time distortion one would get on a psychedelic.......but that didn't explain how my heart rate was reaching 140 for the record throughout the last 2ish years that I have been measuring it it has always always sat at a comfy 5560 while not using HRraising drugs such as dxm or speed when I got it taken in the nurses office in the psychiatric facility and how I felt like I was about to die. When I went and got that ekg I believe actually traumatized me in a way. Coming fairly close to death which has actually happened to me a numerous times with my purging phase over exercising phase I actually kept a fucking exercise bike in my tiny ass room and legit would use it non stop for 35 hours to burn off literally everything I ate and then some feeling proud when my net calories for the day ended up in the negative. it was bad real bad restriction phase I have eaten less than 500 calories day for months at a time several times in fact I can feel a restriction phase coming on as I am pushing myself to not eat God I hate being eating disordered but st this point it's a safety blanket after I've been dealing with this shit day n day out since 13 yrs old me first decided to eat like 100 calories a day for 2 or 3 months can't rmmbr cos I was obese. Cant really remember if I started out with disordered thinking and intentions or if it just was a crash dietturned weird obsession and addiction to weight loss. and also this one non eating disorder related time I was riding in a car with my mom maybe 1 12 years ago legit almost got tboned we would have been hit on myher side of the car had we been just 2 seconds slower getting through the intersection that person would have hit us. oddly enough she was panicking yet I f elt absolutely nothing no adrenaline no fear nothing. I attribute that to how I learned to dissociate from everything at. A young age due to my father's husband abusing us constantly lol dissociation as a coping mechanism is cool notI wholeheartedly believe I could have died if I continued with the purging I still get extreme anxiety when I analyze that specific ekg I know I should throw it out but I just can't I am a person who is very much into record keeping. I feel like I am not actually alive that I died months years ago and this is maybe purgatory. I alternate between genuinely feeling like I should truly not be am not actually alive because of all of this shit. Not sure if that's connected to the ptsd or what. I mean I was dxd with major depressive disorder with psychotic features at one point. God my life is a nightmare. I so desperately wish to take the place of a normal person Ie didn't have an abusive biological father isn't a piece of shit drug addict doesn't harm themselves via eating habits and excessive exercise doesn't have all these stupid ridiculous mental things. how did my life end up like this....... I fantasize about it alot. Normal people with normal lives take that shit for granted. It angers me. They just don't understand how goddamn lucky they fucking are Holy fucking shit. Oops sorry for the going off on a total tangent. That happens to me sometimes.Anyway...How do I get over this.... I honestly would not take any med like that on a daily basis unless I had an at home ekg that I could use like 12 times a day. Actually every time I discontinued an Ssri or antipsychotic it as because I could sense that my QT interval was prolonged. Even if the drug was helping me. It's horrible. I have a cardiologist appointment soon because I got minor chest pains during exercise a few weeks ago. Which doesn't sound particularly bad but that coupled with the knowledge of the fact that many people can have silent heart attacks and asymptomatic arrhythmias it's downright terrifying. I am scared about what I might find out if I mayhaps did permanent structural unfixable damage to my heart muscle from a only a several month long bulimic episode and am now much much more vulnerable to cardiac events.... I almost don't want to go. Now what's weird about this phobia is that I currently am using Xanax at night and meth during the day and I'm also a smoker. Its weird how those three things are pretty notgood for you yet I have less anxiety about smoking a cig or a bowl of meth than taking an anti depressant???!???It's so irrational and honestly I believe it's an ocd thing as I also tend to take my blood pressure 420 times a day no fucking joke and weigh my self constantly and also check my pulse to see if my heart rhythm is normal about 10x a day. My blood pressure is so good that even as I am fucking high out of my mind on meth and just smoked a cig the highest it goes is like 13085 which insanely and funnily enough is still probably lower than like 70 of Americas blood pressure lmao which is just slightly hypertensive. It's normally with only the Cigs and no meth like 9060 sometimes even like 8557 no lie. I attribute it to my whole foodplant based diet. I'm not really sure why I still compulsively take my BP. But anyway This anxiety is destroying me. I really do think I need to be on an SSRI or something but I guarantee I could not even take a single benadryl without panicking hardcore.So. Does anyone deal with this fear of an abnormal heart rhythm specifically? I just wonder how common it is. And how people deal with it. end Xanax fueled rant about my mental issues. I would be shocked if anyone actually reads this entire essay,Anxiety

Does anybody's anxiety present with just the following symptomsChest TightnessTightness in the front of the neck and under the chinLightheadednessDizzinessFeeling FaintLike I may pass outNauseaThese are the symptoms I've been feeling. I don't really seem to have an impending sense of fear or doom when these things happen but I will say they are triggered by talking about my condition or just general stress but sometimes they happen for no reason at all. I have just been sitting watching TV playing a video game or scrolling through Reddit and they've happened.I've been to the ER three times at two different hospitals in the past week with these symptoms in addition to high blood pressure and all three times my blood work and ECG have been normal.I need to add a lot of these symptoms got worse when lying down and got better when sitting up or walking.In light of that last detail the ER doctors said it's just GERD and sent me home with orders for a PPI medication and a Blood Pressure medication.Well the GERD has improved and all the symptoms I've listed above have improved as well but haven't gone away.I'm seeing an anxiety doctor later this week and out of an abundance of caution a cardiologist later next month soonest they could get me inAnother detail I received a call from the doctor earlier telling me my cholesterol was high and my potassium was a little high from the Lisinopril BP med so they started me on a diuretic and a cholesterol medication. As soon as I got off the phone with that news I instantly started feeling the pressure in my neck and chest...

35536,Anxiety Symptoms I'm new to this Reddit thing but I have been reading posts in this subreddit for a couple of weeks now and I thought I would post about my anxiety symptoms. I am recently struggling with the thought that this really is anxiety my biggest fear is of course the big Cword lymphoma for example. Everything started in November about 4 months ago on vacation in Vietnam. I experienced what I think was my first panic attack with heart palpitations pressure on chest difficulty to breath etc. Since then I have experienced so many different symptoms and sensations such as lump in throat feeling of not getting enough air difficulty to breath waking up several times every night sometimes with a strange feeling of fear lately my skin feels like its burning or is sensitive it also sometimes feels like my heart flutters skips a beat or is just pounding out of my chest but not a fast heartbeat just very hard and powerful. I also experience headaches like never before extremely cold feet pretty much all the time. Man I've probably missed a few sensations too but this is really getting to me. I've had EKG echo blood work done to test my thyroid etc and all came back clear. I'm thinking about how I feel all the time and I am noticing every little sensation in my body and the smallest thing can set me off into almost panic for a few seconds. Lately its been more of pressure on my chest and difficult to breath thats been the worst symptom. On top of this I had a cold for about three weeks ago and I felt a lymph node that was swollen this set my health anxiety off into a frenzy and I can't stop thinking about it ever since. I can still feel the lymph node I'm touching it all the freaking time hoping its gone knowing that I shouldn't and my doctor said it was nothing to worry about but as you know health anxiety finds its way back no matter what.

34837,I'm spiraling right now. What do you guys do. How do you cope with it. Just need a shoulder to lean on and a friend to talk to. Recently just moved to a new city for a new job and I am all by myself in my apartment. I don't have furniture yet and I am still sleeping in an air mattress right before I moved I had a muscle strain and the doctor prescribed me a short dose of prednisone. I started to get real bad side effects at the end of the course and my blood pressure is shot up. Went to the ER and was told not stress out and that it was just anxiety and the drug clearing my system. My intial BP when they took it was 18097 and thenback secs later dropped to 16393I was thirsty and urinating all the time. I was convinced I had diabetes and high blood pressure. All while moving to a new city amp new job. Then began experiencing really bad heart issues coupled high blood pressure. Tried to just relax but still stressing. Then yesterday had a blood in my nose all day which freaked me out so much. I stupidly kept picking at it with my finger to check throughout the day. It never ended had blood in my nose from 8am to 5pm was freaked out went to the ER doctor prescribes me a bunch of antibiotics and steroids. Looking back I am in shock on how I just kept sticking my finger in my nose because I was so anxious. Now I am hardcore stressing over catching MRSA or staph because didn't wash my hands before and was in the hospital. Then today spit up blood that lasted for about 30 mins. Thought I was dying. Called 911 Em's came and they were not to concerned looking at the amount of blood the fact that I was being treated for blood in nose. I'm currently convinced right now that I have a deadly bacterial infection and will die this weekend all while having high blood pressure. Reading consistently is 145155ishover 9580ish range.

52349,Anxiety So I just need a bit of reassurance that I am not alone with this and a few tipps if you have. I'm currently holding my first job after uni and during this first year my finances have been a huge trigger for my anxiety.At the moment I am scared to look at my online banking. Scared that I am not able to cover my basic finances. Of losing that little bit of financial independance and security I have for the first time. I just feel totally unequiped to deal with money.,Anxiety
52605,People often say Really? when I tell them I have anxiety and I have mixed emotions about it. On the one hand its comforting to know that all of my worries about coming across as nervous or awkward are so out of proportion that people dont even know I have anxiety. On the other hand it feels sort of invalidating to my struggle if that makes sense. This thing often consumes my life and its frustrating that no one knows how hard Im trying. They just think this is easy for me that I can effortlessly raise my hand and speak in class like other people do. Thats not to say that I feel negatively toward the people who say this more that its just generally frustrating that people have no idea. Have yall thought about this too? Do you look at it a different way?,Anxiety

52584,I am tired of having anxiety I am physically and mentally very exhausted right now and I tried to fall asleep but Im so nauseous from my anxiety that I really just couldnt and sometimes I just like want to feel normal so bad but I feel like I will never get there. My anxiety sucks so bad. I feel like most days it controls who i am and what i act like for that day. Today i went out with my friends and we had a good time but we ended up being outside a lot longer than we would and i got extremely cold and started panicking. We were far from everyones house and all i wanted was to go home. They came to my house afterwards and it was nice for a while but i was still feeling anxious. When they all left i felt immediately better like this huge weight on my chest being lifted off. its not that i dont like my friends but being around people is so exhausting. I hate that im like this i just wanna feel normal so bad. I get anxious so easily and it wont go away for hours. Then when im not feeling anxious i feel depressed. It constantly feels like a never ending storm or something. Like just when it starts to feel bright and the rain might stop it starts again and gets so dark. Im constantly fighting just to stay sane and its so hard. All i want is to feel normal and okay and maybe real because im constantly dissociating. I do have a therapist btw,Anxiety
52667,My mom doesnt care anymore I 24M have been dealing with anxiety and treatment resistant depression for the past few years or so. Its gotten very bad and my mental health has deteriorated as the days go on. Ive started struggling with really bad brain fog and confusion and its really freaked me out lately. Ive been unable to work since mid last year and still live with my brother and mom. My dad moved about 30 mins away a year and a half ago after my parents got divorced but they stayed friends.The past few months have been hell dealing with the brain fog on top of the other issues and not being able to find a doctor to take me seriously. Im surely at a loss. My mom has began dating again and is legitimately obsessed with online dating. Buying every membership to every site imaginable talking to a different guy every night and most nights shes going out. Now this probably wouldnt bother me but when I have so much going on sometimes I just need someone to talk to. I was always extremely close to my mom she has always been there for me but lately she really doesnt even seem to care. Her only worry is that Im afraid youre going to hurt yourself but she doesnt want to do anything to help me. She told me this morning that she wants me to go stay with my dad and Im so hurt. Ive lived here for 24 years and I just want to feel clear headed again. Idk what to do and I feel like my parents hate me. I honestly feel like I have nobody.I do go out with friends a lot of nights or just hangout to get out of the house I workout so its not like Im just sitting at home waiting for her. But you cant even have a conversation with her without her staring at her phone. Ive honestly never seen anything like it and I cant imagine losing my parents emotionally. Im at a loss.,Anxiety

I haven't been able to focus at work or at home. I just keep thinking it's cancer even though there's no history in my family of bladder or kidney cancers and I'm only 29.

35184,Very small red lump underneath armpit Just a bit of a background I have always been very self conscious of my health from worrying about the smallest symptoms to convincing myself I had ALS disease. Anyways today after a good hour and a half workout I noticed right after a slight discomfort underneath my left armpit. I looked to check it out and there was a very small red bump that is somewhat tender to the touch. I don't know if this is just something minor like a pimple cyst etc. Keep in mind I stared to mysteriously break out on my face with two pimples just this morning which is quite rare. Or could it be a lymph node that has gone rouge. Everywhere else on my body seems normal just this one spot on my armpit. Ive been down this road before in the past so im not freaking out about anything yet. Just wondering if anyone else in here has had something similar to this?,Anxiety

35061,Health anxiety is the worst Health anxiety can be so incredibly difficult. I've struggled with healthrelated anxiety alongside other anxiety struggles my entire life. It seems as though when one 'health worry' disappears could take days weeks months a new one appears. It's absolutely exhausting and takes over my mind for the entire day. Has anyone found improvement from therapy and if so did you seek a certain type of therapy? I'm going back on my medication antidepressants after coming off of them a few years ago. This past month has been almost unbearable and things have been bad since the summer after suffering a skin cancer scare. Any tips for coping? Today has been really rough. ,Anxiety
52073,Anxiety seriously holding me back. Any insight is greatly appreciated. Hi everyone This is my first time posting on here and this may turn out to be an essay but please bear with me and read to the end. I promise to make this as concise as possible.I'm in my late 20's male and have had anxiety since the beginning of high school. It felt super overwhelming back then and high school could have been an amazing experience had anxiety not gotten in the way. I went to university fairly late and after graduating kept landing contract work and eventually got stuck working at the same grocery store I applied to as an undergrad. The anxiety carried over into the workplace and resulted in my inability to work at a fast pace. I always felt mentally and physically exhausted.This is where I have to mention alcohol and caffeine both of which produce superhuman like effects but with a caveatI tried alcohol for the first time in Montreal at the age of 18 and after downing 2 beers it felt like I had ingested an elixir. My worries went away instantly and felt my brain firing on all cylinders. There were 0 negative emotions and a profound combination of confidence energy euphoria and heightened creativity. I never got addicted to drinking for obvious reasons and only drink on occasion but every time I do it produces the same effects. I also never get drunk. Coffee seems to produce eerily similar effects and I realized this a few years ago after I had a coffee at work and felt like I had snorted crack. I thought I could take on the world and was super excited that I had finally found a solution to my problem. Unfortunately however if I have coffee everyday for 4 days straight by the 4th day it produces the exact opposite effects and I'm left feeling sleepy and lethargic. For me to feel the full effects of coffee I need to refrain from it for at least 7 days. Fast forward to today where I recently started working construction as a sprinkler fitterpipefitter and absolutely hate it. Apart from being a fastpaced environment I'm asthmatic with an allergy to dust and constantly drilling holes into a concrete ceiling has made my asthma worse plus the cement we use to glue the plastic leaves me with a pounding headache during and after work so I know my days are numbered. The company that I'm employed with is currently waiting on a new project so I've had the last 7 days off During this time I've begun doing research on career alternatives and have become very interested in the online world and have decided to upgrade my skills in ecommerce digital marketing and video editing among other things. My morning routine involves getting up at 8 o'clock feeling tired having breakfast followed by tea with milk which produces similar effects to coffee with much less intensity. After having tea my anxiety goes away and I become very focused however when the caffeine wears off my anxiety returns and I go back to feeling mentally exhausted constant worrying overthinking fear of failure lack of motivation etc.As far as I know I'm not depressed nor do I have low selfesteem. I feel good about the way I look and the shape I'm in. Going to the gym helps. I don't have any bad habits. I don't smoke nor do I indulge in social media looking for a dopamine fix. Most of my free time is spent reading online and on YouTube searching educational videos. I also get 7 to 8 hours of sleep every night but usually wake up tired. The only complaint I have with life is my anxiety. Without it I have a powerful personality and I feel like I'm capable of achieving so much but it's causing me to operate at only 50 of my full potential.I was wondering if anyone is able to offer any insight as to why alcohol and caffeine produce such similar effects practically eliminating my anxiety before the effects wear off and if anyone has had similar experiences? Could alcohol and caffeine contain something which I might be deficient in? Could I get this in a pill form?I was thinking of making an appointment with my family doctor but just thought I'd reach out here to see what the members here have to add. I'm open to the idea of trying antidepressants but at the same time worried about the side effects. Do antidepressants really only cause side effects in the first couple of weeks? Based on some of my research that seems to be the case. Apologies for the long post and I would greatly appreciate any input. Thanks.,Anxiety
52097,Having panic attacks in one specific class? Ive suffered from anxiety since middle school and Ive definitely always had the hardest time with it in classroom settings. Im in college now and Ive never really noticed my anxiety in any of my classes until now. I have one class that because attendance is required and I have to make a bit of a scene to exit has suddenly started making me extremely anxious. I find that I suddenly cant breathe and feel like Im about to pass out even when Im sitting down. It got so bad yesterday that I had to leave and I skipped class this morning too. After having a fullblown panic attack in that class last night I now have intense anxiety about returning. Skipping isnt an option anymore but Im so afraid of having another panic attack in there. Any advice is much appreciated thank you so much!,Anxiety

I have also noticed a couple of cysts. On the back of my head my ankle and on the batwing area of my arm. Doctors have looked at the cysts and told me theyre nothing to worry about but I cant stop worrying that its something else or that having these cysts means Im developing others in dangerous spots my brain or lungs. I stupidly looked up diseases that are cooccurring with hs thinking it would make me feel better if I saw that people with HS are just more likely to develop some benign cysts and it mentioned thyroid disorder which I have and lymphoma and heart disease which I am constantly terrified about.Talk me down.

I was just playing FIFA and boom a big palpitation hit I started to panic felt lightheaded because I was holding my breath because I was so tense and then calmed down. I have had my heart checked 7 times 2 of which are private best testing ones and its perfect so I know its not going to harm me but still catches me off guard I think its more of the fact I was leaning forward that it felt harder and the fact I was breathing in lol. Anyway ! I was laying in bed thinking I need to just once and for all get over all of the symptoms that are making me scared of being Ill and dying. How can I do that ???? GET OVER MY FEAR OF DYING now Im not saying Im perfectly fine with death because I am not but I just thought to myself I cant stop death and I just need to accept it. If there isnt a god I wont know about dying after if there is a God I could go to heaven which is great and who knows I could reincarnate and live life again. We dont know so its the anxiety of not knowing which scares me and leaving my family behind. Like I say Im a healthy 22 year old male with NO health conditions death can happen at anytime and could happen the next minute but for my age and health it is unlikely but never zero. Now Im religious and I am sort of anxious in my mind that God is trying to get me to accept death so I can die soon lol but I dont wanna die soon thats why Im scared off. Thats just my anxious mind thinking right ? I guess the positive way of looking at it is that God is getting me to get over my fear of death so I can live the LONG HAPPY HEALTHY LIFE that he put out for me. Can anyone help me accept death even more ?,Anxiety

52637,I am sad that a teenager blocked me from viewing his story. I 23F have a pretty okay relationship with my boyfriend's 24M family. His mom is a devote Christian and her and I are pretty close and his brother let's call him Jake and I are okay as well.ampx200BI follow the little brother who is 16 on Instagram and we occasionally interact liking stories picsetc. Yesterday I remembered that my friends and I created a 'burner' account 3 years ago that we used to look and follow people we didn't know crazy I know. ampx200BAnyways I noticed that Jake was following this burner. I looked at his profile as saw a bunch of stuff posted that I have never seen before. It was typical teenage boy stuff like rap music middle fingers in pictures etc. but nothing that I haven't seen before. I realized that I was blocked from viewing these stories and unblocked whenever he posted other stuff. I instantly started to feel sick and uneasy at the thought him blocking and unblocking me each time. I even felt a little teary. I thought does he think I am uncool? Old? Did he think I was going to tell his mom? I also post things with cursing etc. so I really felt confused. I know in reality it is really not that deep because I too have older adults in my life 'blocked' from viewing my story but the feeling I felt was uncontrollable. I don't want to feel like this anymore. I have felt similar to this in other occasions and another user asked if I had rejection sensitive dysphoria.

I went back in today and they looked over the area and gave me antibiotics due to the lymphnodes still being tender and the pain radiating into my chest.I picked up the prescription and got home and realized I have the wrong prescription.

52625,New to this. Need coping skills Hello I am new to this community but I wanted some help. Ill start with some context. Ive always been a person that throws up and a lot of the time it was when I was nervous. This past year tho it has gotten much worse with a time where I even went to the hospital because I hadnt eaten in like 2 days and I felt so physically exhausted and dehydrated. At first I thought it was from weed and something called CHS but quitting weed didnt really make a difference. I also have delt with this vommiting in highschool before I would go to a party I would get so nervous I would puke. And that was before I ever touched weed.This led me to go to a gastro doctor who said he did not think it was weed related and instead some inflammation in intestines. Ive been on meds for that for 3 months but it was getting better and I really started to take my anxiety seriously so I went to my doctor and they prescribed me an SSRI. I also will start therapy in a few weeks here. For the past month after about 1.5 month on SSRI I have been doing better. I hadnt thrown up for a month but these past 2 nights I have had very panic attack like feelings and tonight even pushed me to the point where I had to get up from being comforted by my girlfriend to throw up. And I always feel awful about it and like its going to just keep happening and I think I get stuck in that cycle.Does anyone have any tipsadvice on dealing with this before my therapy appointment I thought I was doing so good but now Im afraid Im slipping back.,Anxiety

I went to several doctors all of which said I was healthy. I finally worked up the courage to go to a neurologist and upon seeing how anxious I was she gave me a brain MRI. It turns out that I had an incidental finding which was benign brain calcification. She said it is unremarkable and the rest was deemed normal. I had another CT a year later and the size was unchanged. So that could indicate Ive just had it my whole life and means nothing and they pushed the next CT to 5 years away which would be next year or the year after. They did say that if Im having symptoms such as a headache they gave no other symptoms that we can schedule it sooner. Im just terrified that its multiplying in my brain right now or something. I have terrible health anxiety and get horrible symptoms especially with vision. Im just nervous that its the calcification causing this and not my anxiety. Has anyone else had experience with this? Or any doctors that can give me some reassurance? I know I should just make an appointment with the neurologist but she already thinks Im crazy and told me to see a psychologist about my anxiety which I do lol. Thanks on advance! ,Anxiety

52264,Should i be worried about my high blood pressure? I recently have been really struggling with anxiety and started taking Lexapro a week ago. So far I havent noticed a benefit from the drug but its my understanding it can take up to 6 weeks to work.Anyways when I was at the doctor 2 weeks ago my bp was elevated. Since then Ive been measuring it daily and noticed its consistently high 14090. Now ive got more anxiety worrying that Ill get a heart attack or something. Just could use some reassuring words. Also is it normal for anxiety to spike your blood pressure? Ive been trying to exercise and eat better the past week to help but not seeing a result yet.,Anxiety

51759,Buspar not for long term result? I just left my primary doctor and suggested BuSpar due to all the good things Ive heard on here. Always turn down SSRIs because of sexual side effects and heard this is better. Anyway she told me buspar is effectively just like Xanax? That I cant take both its one or the other? Theyre both an as needed drug. Is this true? To me Xanax is a bandaid. Long term wont change and work toward a cause. She made it sound like buspar is effectively the same even though its an SNRI not a benzo???,Anxiety
35147,Rabies Scare So I came upon a branch that had some porcupine quills embedded in it and was stupid enough to pull a few out to get a better look. A managed to poke myself in the finger with one it didn't go very deep no blood and I pulled it out right away.Anxiety reared its head and I was suddenly worried about exposure to rabies. I did call urgent care to see what they said. They didn't know the answer right away and had to do a bit of research. The verdict that came back was porcupines don't carry rabies so you should be fine. I wasn't particularly confident in this assessment since porcupines can like most mammals carry and transmit rabies. I'm wondering if she was just referring to the quills.Any way I'm still kind of freaking out Rabies does not seem like a fun way to go.Any reassurances? I'm sure people have been stuck with quills before without getting rabies right?,Anxiety
52685,Panic Attacks Hi I've been having very bad anxiety attacks lately. I've been taking valium and it's helped but doesn't eliminate it. I've never had it sooooo bad. I also take olanzapine.

I'm really struggling on what to do.Anyone else feel the same or have been in a similar place?,Anxiety
35411,Worried about Toxic Shock Because Im an irresponsible idiot Thursday I started my period no big deal there. Friday night my husband and I went out to grab drinks and dinner to celebrate his new job. I had put a tampon in and since it was a light one completely forgot and we had sex. Neither or us felt the tampon probably due to alcohol. Saturday morning comes and Im off running errands. I put a tampon in on top of the one already in there bc I never sleep with a tampon in so It was habit. I changed it normally throughout the day. When I got into bed at 11pm Saturday night I had a weird feeling I left my tampon in from Friday. I go to the bathroom and I had. I removed it put a pad on and went to sleep. Now Im worried sick Ive got Toxic Shock Syndrome.SO yesterday Im tired which honestly probably was due to a busy weekend and the fact that I get up at 4 am MF for work. Last night I was nauseous and dizzy falling asleep. However I had just remembered those were symptoms of TSS then started having them. This morning I felt some nausea and a headache. I get frequent headaches from sleeping like an idiot with my neck but Im worried because its together. Logically the nausea is the fact that Im presenting to the entire leadership team today at work but of course I go back to I just have TSS and this is the beginning. Im so worried and now Im afraid Ill blow this presentation. I just started a new role so my health insurance doesnt kick in until April. I would absolutely go to the doctor or ER if I was certain I had TSS and not just bad anxiety. ,Anxiety
34772,Rabies fear Hello everyone back again this time with a rabies scare.I got a new cat about 3 months ago and she's a community stray from kind of the outskirts of Philadelphia. She's about 9 months old now and very rambunctious and quite a cutie.However as she is rambunctious I somehow started looking into whether or not she could have rabies. She runs around like crazy rolls around a lot and loves biting me. Like LOVES biting me. Definitely drawn blood a few times no infections due to careful cleaning after. I read that rabies usually shows 23 months after infection and upwards of a year so theoretically if she was bitten before I got her she's 100 an indoor cat now she could start showing symptoms. Is it at all possible or am I being a doof?Also should mention got her all of her shots after taking her in. Not sure if that matters for rabies.Thank you all!,Anxiety

34452,Breast Cancer Worries Hi everyone I'm sure this is nothing new but I really needed to get it out.My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer a few months ago and is currently going through chemo. I've had bad health anxiety all my life and my mom's diagnosis has pretty much put me over the edge.My left breast same as the one she found her cancer in felt sore so of course I squeezed and kneaded the hell out of it trying to feel something. I didn't feel anything other than the fact that it is slightly bigger than the other which is something I've known for a while but now I'm second guessing myself. The soreness went away with my last period and then returned this month. Again I squeezed and checked it compulsively. I cannot keep my hands off it. Always checking to see if it feels better or worse. My SO gently suggested that this isn't helping but I can't seem to stop. Now that my period has arrived it feels much better but there's still one spot that hurts to poke. I've also lost 70lbs in the past couple years so my breasts don't look great for a 26 year old and I think that contributes to my worry. I'm always looking for symmetry to assuage my fears.And now I've developed a rash that I'm pretty sure is from stress. It started on my stomach and is spreading. This prompted me to look up inflammatory breast cancer and I've basically given myself a death sentence. I'm going to the clinic tomorrow to have it checked out but every fibre of my being wants to cancel and just hope it goes away. I'm also going to request a referral for an ultrasound. I'm sorry if this is all over the place. I usually talk to my parents about my fears but obviously I don't want to bring this up. Besides the anxiety it's causing I also feel so horrible and selfish. Has anyone else imagined or basically given themselves symptoms after a family member or friend has been diagnosed with an illness? Any suggestions on how to function normally? I'm exhausted from the constant adrenaline rushes Thank you,Anxiety

34679,Pain in left thighleg and muscle spasms freaked out about DVT again I've been afraid of DVT since early March because I have had various weird spasms and pain in my left leg. It happened twice that I woke up with immense pain and cramping in that leg. This happened to me when I was a kid sometimes but I don't remember if it was just in one leg then. I've had two doctors tell me that my pain and symptoms don't match those of DVT and that I need to stop Googling so I'm laying off the Google now...The pain was mostly gone the last two weeks but right now I have a lot of cramp and a burning sensation in that same leg again and it seriously makes me anxious.I also have another issue. I got meds for my anxiety gabapentin and lexapro but I am afraid to take them because of the possible side effects. I have been taking gabapentin but it only helps for a few hours. Lexapro seems more dangerous and I don't know if I'll just worry myself by thinking about the symptoms. Anyway thanks for letting me get this off my chest. ,Anxiety

34769,Weird symptom I've been having that scares me. So for the past year I've been having this weird symptom on and off and it freaks me out every time. It only happens when I get out of the shower. My toes will turn noticeably bright red while the rest of my foot remains regular skin color. When this happens they are also very hot when you touch them. There's no pain numbness or tingling Just extremely red. Normally it only happens when I get out of the shower but I got off the couch tonight and it happened. I've done a lot of research on the possibilities and the most common answer is peripheral artery disease and that terrifies me. I suppose I'm just looking for some insight at the moment. I'm a 28 year old male quite lean. My family has a very good medical history but my father has hypertension. He's not overweight at all it's more of a genetic condition than acquired. I've never been diagnosed with hypertension but I wouldn't doubt if I have it or develop it at some point. ,Anxiety

I am very convinced that I am going to go into full cardiac arrest and Im only 31 years old. Ill feel a small pain somewhere or smell somethingtheyre all symptoms of sudden and acute heart failure.

Usually it's an ask reddit question or something in the news that causes me to think about things I'm worried about.I just want to know about some subs that i can browse for a while and not worry too much about coming across something health related or depressing but not super happy or positive because then it just feels like I'm distracting myself and it backfires.,Anxiety
33983,Uneven pupils on Friday I was looking in the mirror and noticed that my left pupil is much larger than my right. The vision in that eye is also blurry. I visited an optometrist today who dilated my eyes and confirmed that the left is more dilated than my right but he didn't know why. He assumed that its something I've always had but only noticed now but that's impossible because for the past year I have been obsessively checking my pupils in the mirror to make sure i haven't had a stroke hello health anxiety. a few days before the uneven pupils I woke up with a painful pulled muscle on the left side of my neck could that be related? I also have occasional tinnitus in the left ear usually pulsatile rushing noise. I'm afraid its either a carotid dissectionstroke or some sort of tumor. Maybe I had a seizure in my sleep that cause the pulled neck muscle and the eye issue? Anyway I just wanted to vent and see if anyone else has had weird eye issues or fears. Its tough to have all these thoughts in my head without anyone listening or taking them seriously. ,Anxiety

34767,Helping Twin Brother Deal With Health Anxiety My twin brother 23 m has been suffering an extended episode of anxiety for about a month regarding terminal illness and neurodegenerative diseases. Two years ago he needed to have surgery for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome which was a major anxietycauser. Long story short his arm swelled up and he needed to be taken to the hospital learned he had blood clots in his lungs and spent the rest of the year on blood thinners to prepare for his first major surgery. Since then he's been extremely wary of any aches and pains he feels. This December his arm started hurting and he got an infected salivary gland. That combined with it being around the two year anniversary of his surgery triggered major anxiety symptoms. Since then he's had aches and pains tingling fatigue headaches all proportional to the level of anxiety he feels at the moment.He recognizes this too. He knows that anxiety something we have been officially diagnosed with combined with the hypersensitivity that comes from being on the Autism spectrum is the most logical explanation for his symptoms. But there's always that doubt and that causes more anxiety. According to the anxious part of his brain he's had MS some kind of cancer or some obscure disease that he read about on Wikipedia at some point. We have no family history of cancer MS or any weird diseases and we live extremely healthy lifestyles. He even went to his doctor to see what they thought. His blood pressure is perfect and a blood test came back with the only problem being a Vitamin D deficiency. His therapist has assured him that everything he's feeling is textbook anxiety. Despite this he still gets panicky about every little twinge he feels. It's making him to lose sleep causing him to feel tired and fatigued during the day and giving him more anxiety. It's a selfsustaining cycle.Him describing what it's like to be in the middle of an attack I feel like I'm dying and no one believes me.Now I suffer from health anxiety myself but for different reasons. I hate catching colds because they're basically a constant sensory overload for me. Besides that I've had existential crises and a bout of Alice In Wonderland Syndrome yes really but all of these things are or were made far worse by my anxiety about them. I've been able to get through to my brother by talking about my own experience but that only seems to work temporarily.I'm looking for advice Does anyone here have family members with health anxiety? If so how do you help them? Has anything worked for you? I hate seeing my brother deal with this and I just want to do what I can to help.ampx200BOh and don't hesitate to ask for more details or clarification on anything!,Anxiety

51834,Obsessive thoughts about the past Hello.For about a year I've been having these obsessive thoughts about the past all the ways I've messed up and things I did wrong. It's kinda ridiculous I worry about things that happened 10 od so years ago and I was just a kid back then only about 12. I think about newer things too but especially back then I was cringy and mean to others for no reason I didn't like the band that they did. I never bullied them but I would kinda laugh at them and point out that they're being pandered to. Now I would just turn away and ignore them I don't know what was up with me back then. To my defense I was almost always the youngest of the group surrounded by people who were 1416 from both sides. I feel like I'm a terrible human being and that I will be punished for them any day now I don't know how exactly by some external force that will come from outside of my home. I'm afraid that people who know me now and are my friends or people I'll meet in the future will judge me so hard and turn away from me. I've deleted every old social media account I could remember I still make sure that my old emails are active so that I could delete any more if I'll remember. I'm on pretty heavy medications antidepressants three doses of synthetic pregabalin and an antipsychotic to quell my anxiety further and I can function well but these thoughts still come to me randomly and make me anxious. I don't know what to do anymore My biggest wish is to just move on from that period of my life and close this chapter. On one hand if someone came to me with thoughts like these I would tell them that it was so long ago and they have likely very little to do with the person they were at 13 Besides everyone was a bit of a little shit at that age. But for some reason when it comes to me I just can't free myself When I get scared I feel like an ensnared wikd animal only the snare is just in my head. Did any of you struggle with something like this? What should I do?,Anxiety
35155,Diabetics Ketoacidosis and Brain Cancer Hi I'm new here. I started having very mild health anxiety when I was younger but it recently increased the last few months. In December I went to the ER due to chest pains because I was sure I was having a heart attack even though I was terrified. I went to the doctor and they said it was just acid reflux and they sent me home with a prescription. After that I had to followup with my PCP and she told me there was an abnormality in my EKG my second one and referred me to a cardiologist to do an echocardiogram. That same week I was worrying about every little ache and symptom that I've read about heart attacks and kept manifesting each one. It sucked because I didn't feel like it was all in my head and I kept freaking out. Mind you I'm a college student away from home which made everything worse. Winter break came and I went home. I didn't feel any symptoms and I wasn't worried about my health anymore. Then I came back to school last month and my friend had a stroke. She's 19 so I was surprised at how young she was to be having a stroke. This event stirred up my past anxieties about my heart and I found myself checking my heart rate often throughout my day again. I would also google every possible heart condition that I could have that I wouldn't know of. The next week I finally got my echocardiogram done and the doctor said it was completely normal which eased my mind at little bit. That same week I had on and off nausea which I was sure was because of how anxious I was about my health. The next few days go by and I start having tension headaches or so I think. They were on and off as well but it just hurt to the point where I was convinced I had brain cancer. With the nausea and the headaches I just assumed. I tried to refrain from googling the symptoms because I knew it would elevate my worries but I couldn't resist. The last few days I've been so worried about having brain cancer because I wouldn't be able to focus and some things were hard to remember but there is no family history of any type of cancer so I kept trying to focus on that. Now I am currently worrying that I have Diabetic Ketoacidosis. I have no family history of diabetes and I've never been told that I should watch out for it because I am 18 normal weight and have been healthy. But lately I've been stress eating because of how anxious I've been and food makes me feel a little better. However I always feel guilty right after eating and it makes me feel sick to my stomach. I just don't know how to cope with this anymore and I have a doctor's appointment next week so hopefully she can ease my mind a bit more. ,Anxiety

35540,I just want to feel normal againhow can one do such a thing? Just a college student who wants to feel somewhat sane again. Its been almost three months since my blood clot and although Ive adapted to things I still dont feel like myself. Prior to today I was living in fear constantly thinking about how things affect me and the worst possible outcome. These thoughts took over everything in my life even before this clot I was and an over thinker. Ive never been on medication for anxiety and just got on it so hopefully that will help some current thoughts of fear fade. Will I wake up tomorrow?Throughout these months I have been to numerous doctors appointments and check ups my body just wants to have multiple issues this year I guess. One problem after the next and the moment when my fear starts to subside another issue arises school. I started to feel better healthy in a way yet because I was so determined to feel humane again I fell behind. Some professors were understanding others focused more on the needed work rather than my health. Little do they all know that if my grades fall I lose my scholarship. Three years down the drain right there. How do I explain to professional people that I was afraid to live? Or that my meds persistently make me tired?I know in my heart mind and soul that there are people out there who have it SO much worse. Believe me when I say I overthink I do. You could make eye contact with me and Id think something is automatically wrong with me. I dont have time for counseling because I fear it would interfere with school. Im not one to vent no one ever has their full attention so I keep everything in. But goodness Im so tired of living in fear. The idea of being told how super rare my case was and that Im lucky to even be here lives in the back of my head. If anyone has advice with life after a blood clot anxiety college or anything I could really use it. I know my post was extremely jumbled and vague for that I am sorry.

At first I thought it was really a snot deep down but then I noticed it happened when I wasn't breathing meaning it's not even connected to that. Has anyone had anything similar happen to them?

35022,Venting A little info new to the community. Im 18f weight is 165 at 54. Back in September I got diagnosed with a stomach infection called cdiff. Its been a whirlwind since then. If you read up on it its super hard to get rid of mainly because elderly people primarily get it and its a spore firming bacteria. It can kill you. It caused me tremendous anxiety. But of course with my luck I contracted it. I was on antibiotics for two months now Im waiting to retest my stool again. I have to wait a month at least in case I get a false positive stool test. Everything has been normal bathroomwise for a month. So I thought I had gotten rid of it and was excited to go back to the doctor. Until yesterday my lose stools came back. Again. And now Im through the roof just upset. If I test positive for it again Ive tested positive twice now. then I go in for a fecal matter transplant. Also for the past few months Ive been experiencing this sternum pain literally in my chest bone. Only with certain arm movements. Anywho moral of this is that I just want to be okay. Its affecting me my relationship and everything around me. ,Anxiety

I have been worried about cutting down in case of fatal withdrawal symptoms however I haven't had a drink since Friday night and I think I feel fine?

I notice that when I hunch over or when I press on this particular spot on my back near where my bra strap would be it feels like I bruised it. It's not painful enough to disrupt my day but it's a little disconcerting. I started googling and I saw a bunch of people who had this and it just went away on its own or it wasn't anything but then of course I continued googling and back pain can be cancer. It's surfacelevel though really does just feel like a skin bruise. And I don't feel it at all if I sit normally and don't press on it.How worried should I be? Any way I can rule out cancer? I'm seeing my doc for a checkup soon.,Anxiety

I think that I have PGAD although granted my anxiety does seem to be making it way worse I do have actual symptoms and reason to believe it. I'm actually just kind of hoping it's all in my head but at the same time I'm worried that if I don't get tested and assessed for it it will turn out to be real and not just my anxiety I hate that feeling of uncertainty ,Anxiety

Im just now worried about my kidney itself.,Anxiety
35195,Sore gland in neck for six days feeling so down with this anxiety. Just need to vent. I've had this problem on and off for a while where it'll flare up for a few days and then go away for a while. I have no idea what triggers it. It's always the left side of my neck under my jaw. I'm assuming it's a lymph node but I can't feel anything when I feel around in that area. But the pain is very localized to that one spot when I press on it or turn my head it'll hurt right there. It also hurts when I swallow but not in a sore throat way more like something is bumping against that inflammation and irritates it. I might go to the walkin clinic today because I'm sick of worrying about it. I have no other symptoms besides a small headache between my eyebrows which started up about two days ago and has stayed pretty constant. It feels like a sinus headache but I don't have the other symptoms besides my typically slightly stuffy nose. Trying to stop obsessing over lymphoma since I know that causes painless nodes and swelling. I just hate that I'm having this for seemingly no reason. I'd feel BETTER if I had a cold because at least then I'd understand the pain came from that. God. I feel like I've had one thing after another for the past six months. ,Anxiety
52491,how did buspironebuspar make you feel? did you take it consistently or only as needed? hi anxious friends! i recently switched my meds from effexor to prozac and added buspirone 10mg for anxiety. my doctor told me to take it as needed but after all the research ive done this doesn't make sense to me. how would it even be effective if i only took it as needed if it's not a fastimmediate acting drug? it builds up in your system over time right? so i'd need to take it consistently for a long period of time to feel any effects? ill ask my doctor too of course but im very interested in other people's experiences with buspirone specifically and whether you took it as needed or daily. ive been taking 10mg 3x a day for about a month with some missed doses in between and i do feel less anxious but the way my doctor described it made it sound like it was a fast acting anti anxiety drug that calms you down after you take a dose rather than one that builds in your system over time. if it matters i also take concerta and bupropion. thanks friends ,Anxiety

Age 16 Sex Male Height 5'4 Weight 100 lbs Race American Duration of complaint 1 dayRecently was doing a small club cleanup and we've found like 67 syringe needles some covered w blood during our beach cleanup. However I didn't touch them with my paper gloves at all but I've used sticks to find them. I'm starting to feel a little paranoidinsecure that even though I didn't touch them at all the club decided to keep going at it and we were still picking up sticks and cleaning the rocky side of the island. And I was wearing slippers during that cleanup and didn't get to wash my hands right away.Can abandonedold syringe needles give you HIVs? And is it only possible when injected?

So I have been sick with something I dont know what I just flew back from Europe to America after 3 months so Im thinking its something from the plane. I have a had a pretty bad cough that has been fairly productive for at least the past 5 days. Yesterday I noticed a very small amount of blood in my first cough after I stood up in spit into sink it was bright red and streaky the next cough was back to mucus only. Kinda freaked out by it I went to the doctor a couple days ago and blood tests just came back fine but I dont know if they would tell. Any help would be greatly appreciated kinda freaking out.

My son was recently diagnosed with a form of epilepsy and my daughter will be starting speech therapy soon amongst other things going on. Ive had pretty severe health anxiety over the course of my life 32f but this year it seems to be peaking. Im currently on the tail end of a week long brain tumor worry and I found my self going down the Google rabbit hole again tonight after reading a news article about silent brain tumor symptoms. Its been a rough night. I really thought I could see the light at the end of this tunnel. Ah well. Just looking for some support and maybe we can cheer each other up.

35101,Thinking I might have diverticulitis I don't really like trying to diagnose myself but after living with this unique kind of pain for a few months now I'm trying to stay positive by considering other causes other than defaulting to my mindset that it's cancer.I've been experiencing pain on and off in my lowerleft abdomen. It ranges anywhere from an ache to a burning sensation depending on the day. When it first started happening it got so bad I couldn't sleep on that side. It seems to get worse when the waistband on any of my pants puts pressure in that area.I have already been to the doctor for this before and they took an ultrasound to make sure that it wasn't an ovarian cyst but they found nothing. I also had a CTScan done in that region in July of last year when a kidney stone got lodged in my ureter tube so they didn't find any anomalies in that area either note the pain in my left side only started happening around late November.Eating out too much greasy foods or overeating tends to exacerbate it more. I'm planning on making an appointment just as soon as my husband and I are approved for our onsite assistance program but it might be another couple of weeks until we hear back from them.I'm currently trying to see if limiting my intake to a healthy amount drinking lots of water and exercise helps any.,Anxiety

35348,I dont understand why my sickness wont go away. Im starting to think I might have neck or throat cancer. Two months ago I went to the doctor due to a cough and a caught up stuffy head Ive had for literally 23 months straight. The doctor gave me decongestants and antibiotics to tackle infections. 1 month later I still have the cough and I developed really bad mouth ulcers which made it extremely difficult to eat or even talk along with a lump developing under my jaw which was supposedly a swollen lymph node. I got a blood test taken. I also had constant tiredness. I got acid reflux then in between all of this which I also got medicine for. Its cured now.I got prescribed medicine again and I got rid of the ulcers and the soreness in my mouth. The lump under my jaw disappeared and my blood tests said I was perfectly fine but I still dont feel right. Another lump has just grown on the right side of my neck this time and my cough and stuffy head is STILL effecting me. Im really starting to worry that this might be something very serious. Why cant I just become fully healthy? Its been months almost 4 months now. Im going back to the doc again on Friday and this time Im going to tell her my concerns. ,Anxiety

51666,27 yo with severe anxiety living with parents fails at life Hey ranxiety I am in a very tough spot rn i was working towards becoming a teacher for 7 years started my teaching certification programme in my country you need to do this but after 3 weeks I was so anxious of all the people i constantly had to deal with that i started suffering from constant belly pain diarrhea insomnia. So after spending 4 weeks on sick leave i decided i want to quit and try to focus on my mental health first and maybe find a small job like a 10 h job in order to be slowly introduced into regular work life while getting support from therapy and social services the 10 h job idea was from my therapist because i havent had a job except for a summer job when i was 18 which was very traumatic because the boss constantly berated me made fun of me and humiliated me.I still live with my parents who have financially supported me throughout my studies tho till i was 25 my health insurance was free and they got tax benefits and child benefits from me still living with them if i had moved out i would have been entitled to support by them my divorced father had to pay me 112 a month for instance and to them me quitting because i just can't work with children and a ton of colleagues and the constant stress of being judged and evaluated and dealing with maladjusted kids supposedly is understandable. However they demand of me to immediately get a fulltime or 30 hour job so i can move out ASAP in potentially a field i have little experience in and they say i shouldnt become unemployed and rely on social services because it would look bad on my CV.Because i was struggling to find a field that would interest me within a week of deciding to quit teaching and me offering to apply for a 10 h job at a library smth i wanted to do before but my applications failed sadly as a transitionary period my mother basically screamed daily at me the last couple days saying i should get a job and gtfo and stop acting like a child when i started crying shaking and feeling like i was about to throw up. She says she is entitled to her financial support paying off after all this time and that i should get a job like a normal person and support myself. As a result of this constant yelling and screaming and ranting i havent been able to sleep for days i have lost 3 kg of weight lack any appetite have to get up every night cus of diarrhea and havent slept more than 3 hours most nights. Yday i proposed the idea with the 10 hour job and my mother reacted as if i was telling her a bad joke and said i should be ashamed for even suggesting such a thing. In her rage she said i should gtfo she doesnt care if it's social housing or a homeless shelter and that she didnt financially support me to become a workshy leech. So in my panic i phoned a bunch of social services just in case so i would know my options. Today she came in tears to me and said she was just very concerned about my future. Yday I talked to my doctor and my therapist about the potentiality of getting kicked out and they asked if i could go somewhere to get away from this situation so i can recover a bit like i was supposed to during my sick leave so i decided today to leave for my boyfriend's place who is still a student and also lives with his parents but in a different country we are in EU so travelling is no problem. I have some money left from my teaching job that i could give them if they ask for it i was paying my fam 250 a month from the teacher pay so i wouldnt be freeloading while i stay there. I have been taking Sertraline Zoloft for a few weeks now but have had very little success. I have been in therapy since november and been on sick leave since late february. I think if i had stayed i would have become suicidal as i was noticing myself starting to go numb and dissociate whenever i was being yelled at. After explaining my situation to my doctor she said she couldnt let me leave without asking if i have sucidial thoughts because in that case she would have recommended sending me to a clinic.Some questions are plagueing me now however... am i a coward? Am i doing the right thing? Am i a lazy leech like my parents call me or just too mentally ill to work a proper job for now?What do you guys think about my situation am i doing the right thing? What should i have done in your opinion? Kind of asking as a reality check,Anxiety

I'm struggling to get over it because these cases do happen and I wouldn't know there was a problem until it was too late I can't shake the feeling it is rational to at least have some skepticism... but I know it's impossible to know about everything and I want to stop stressing out so much. any coping tips or advice would be great thank you. ,Anxiety

35534,How to be a supportive partner to someone with health anxiety? Hello. New to posting in forums like this but I am struggling and could use adviceperspective. I hope I am allowed to make posts like this but feel free to remove if it is violating any community rules.ampx200BI found this subreddit when researching health anxiety. My long term partner has been afflicted by this for the last 3 months. I know that is not a very long time but it's been very hard. It feels like he suddenly starting having heart problems and ended up in the ER because he called an ambulance. They said it was panicanxiety and things have gotten worse since. We have done all the medical tests and physically the doctors say he is fine and that his symptoms are anxiety. He is convinced otherwise but I see his behaviors mirrored in all of the posts here. I believe he has health anxiety.ampx200BI'm really trying to be as helpful as I can but I feel so helpless. I am trying to reassure him that he is okay but every other day he spirals into believing that he has cancerkidney diseasemuscular disordersliver cirrhosis etc etc. He even at one point thought he had an STD which was hurtful to me as his longterm partner because I have not been unfaithful and I viewed it as an attack on my character. I realize now that it is US against THE ANXIETY but sometime's it's still hard. Before all of this we used to go and do things all the time. Now it feels like we don't go out and any time I can get him out it's a chore because he feels so sick or anxious.ampx200BHe has started therapy but insists it will not help because he thinks he has a true medical problem and not health anxiety. I want to be as supportive as I can be but I'm really struggling with how to support without enabling or indulging in his fears. ampx200BSo I'm hopeful that this community can help give me some advice on how to help a partner experiencing health anxiety? What is helpful for you to hear from your partners? How can I be the most supportive partner I can be without losing myself which is how I am starting to feel lately? Should I push or encourage him to go out even when he says he is sick? I miss our old life but I don't want to force him into an activity if he really is ill. Alternatively is there anything I can do to be more empathetic? What do you wish your partner knew about your health anxiety?ampx200BThank you for your advice. I just want to understand and be helpful.,Anxiety
34007,IBSpsoriasis My story and never would have thought what was causing it!! I want to share my story because I believe theres a lot people out there in my situation. When I was younger in high school I would get diarrhea going to class mostly happened in the morning. This was around the year 1999. I had psoriasis on my head for most of my life. It would get bad from time to time but never went away. The doctor would prescribe an ointment that stunk like gasoline. I would put this on head and it felt like it was burning the skin off my skull. So I never really used it just suffered as is. Now back to the diarrhea issue. I went to the doctors and they did everything you could imagine. Blood tests stool tests upper and lower GIs and the good old colonoscopy! In the end the doctor said that I was a healthy young man. So he diagnosed me with IBS.Once I graduated from high school it seem to simmer down to where I never really had any more symptoms. So I figured that is was over. Years passed by and once in a blue moon the IBS would come back. But the psoriasis never went away. I moved forward in my career and in my personal life. I thought that the nightmare I had when I was younger would never comeback. Boy I was wrong! One day at work after having something for lunch my captain and I had just taken off we were in the air for all of ten minutes. I looked at him and said we have to go back and land! He asked what was wrong I replied that Im going to crap my pants. So we turned the plane around and landed without incident. The next day my manager called and asked what had happened and I replied that I must have ate something I shouldnt have. Months rolled by with no farther problems other then the psoriasis. I upgraded to captain and loved what I was doing. Then one day it came back only this time it didnt go away!! Much worse I started taking Imodium gel caps one before the flight and as prescribed as many as I need during the flight.this was a bad idea for me but we will come back to thisSo off to the doctor I went and of course started to do familiar tests. Only this time after all the testing the doctor didnt just say it was IBS but it also must be in my head. Now its time to send me to a shrink. There I am off work by this point sitting on a couch playing head games at the same time trying not to mess myself. After the third session I said its not in my head no way!!!My wife is going crazy by this point with me not working so off I went with the same problems back to work. The first day I tried to do one flight. Had diarrhea threes times and kept taking Imodium trying to fight it. I didnt even get the engine started. I went back off work. Then my wife said your going to do whatever I tell you to do now! I was game because I just wanted this to be over. She sent me to a naturalpath doctor I thought that this was going to be a joke but played along as Im willing to do whatever by this point. This ended up being a game changer for me. I told her what was happening and she said tell me what you eat I the run of a day. I told her and she replied that it sounds like a FOOD INTOLERANCE and that its a simple blood test. I said that I already been tested she replied thats for allergies. I agreed to the test. About three weeks later she calls me say the results are in. I went to see her she said I had three different intolerances one was potatoes another was cane sugar with fruit and the last most important....soy. That day I eliminated all three and within a week all my symptoms were gone including my psoriasis even the little bumps on the back of my arms went away!!I was so happy the only problem now is that I have to prepare all my meals and read every label of anything I want to eat. So living on the road as an airline pilot makes it tough but Ive got it down now.Soy is what was causing all my problems and if I have it today it comes back at full fold. Now remember how I said I was taking Imodium GEL caps well one of the ingredients is SOY. Just like a car jamming on the brakes while hitting the gas!!So I had medical problems that regular doctors couldnt find went to a naturalpathic doctor and found out that I have a food intolerance to Soy.,Anxiety

35250,Swollen lymph node in neck and groin for months Hello!So Ive always had lymph nodes that I can feel easily. The two underneath my jaw swelled up when I was about 12 and remain enlarged now Im 21. About a year ago I had felt a squishy node in my neck its smaller than a grape and also one of the same size in my groin region. They are moveable. O do not recall any reasons for them swelling up.I went to the DR in September who didnt seem concerned about them but told me to go back if they didnt disappear in a few weeks. Of course theyre still hereand I chose not to go back to the DR as I had no other symptoms and thought the stress of having scans etc would do more harm than good.Ive felt absolutely fine since the the nodes havent increased in size. But I read a story about how lymph nodes should always go down and now Im scared I have lymphoma.This is giving me massive anxiety and symptoms I plan to ask the Dr tomorrow but I think I just want some reassurance until then as Im driving myself crazy! ,Anxiety
34404,I feel like an idiot for posting here but here goes Brain tumorcancer worries I feel like a dummy but I've definitely suffered from health anxiety in the pastpregnancy scares with my ex lymphoma scares diabetes scares etc so I'm hoping this is just another case of me being a hypochondriac.For the past 2 weeks or so I've had this strange feeling in my head. I can't really call it a headache its more of a pressure that can be felt throughout my head and sometimes more on the top. I wouldn't say its painful just a really annoying feeling. I also feel somewhat of a pressure type feeling in my ears from time to time with associated tinnitus. I've had minor hearing losstinnitus before this headache started but obviously Dr. Google has indicated to me that this could be a tumor. I saw my doctor about it last week and he said that its more likely a tension headache but that if the symptoms continued and I was still worried he'd order a head CT for me have a physical exam scheduled in a few days. I have no other symptoms or problems and I'm a pretty damn healthyactive 23 year old.I guess i dont know what I'm asking for here maybe just words of support from other people who have experienced something similar? The anxiety over this is killing me and there is no real reason for me to be so stressed. Am I being stupid or are my concerns legitimate? Unfortunately I'm having trouble trusting my PCP...the lymphoma scare I mentioned earlier was the result of me feeling a lump in my neck which he diagnosed as a cyst turns out it was actually an enlarged lymph node after an ultrasound was done,Anxiety

45535,My Current Battle with Employment Discrimination This is a long story so I'll try to keep it as brief as I can and only include pertinent details. For those that just want a brief summaryTLDR the Peace Corps rejected me because I admitted to having bipolar not thinking anything of it because I am high functioning and my doctor can clear me. I decided to fight this to the bitter end since I am not my mental illness and they can't reject me based on their discriminatory and outright archaic assumptions about the conditionI am a 23 year old college student that will graduate this spring with degrees in Biology and French. Three years back I was diagnosed BP II and as most of you know it was a wild ride. By communicating with my psychiatrist and by making the right lifestyle choices I have remained totally asymptomatic for more than a year.Being young and hoping to join Doctor's Without Borders someday I decided I would join the Peace Corps to gain the necessary public health program experience and to expand my French I'm looking at West Africa. I spent a large amount of time working on my resume and statement and kept in touch with my local Peace Corps recruiter. He gave me advice and assured me that I was a shoein for a position in Benin because of my health care experience and language experience I work as a fulltime Rec Therapist while finishing classes full time. Not easy but incorporating the right lifestyle choices has helped my time management.After I turned in my application I was informed that I would have to fill out a Health History form divulging any medical conditions that I had. Naturally I was honest my doctor said he'd provide a letter clearing me medically and my recruiter already said verbatim that I am extremely qualifiedWhat happened next blew me away. An automated email was sent to me after I turned in the Health History form informing me that my condition could not be supported in the country I chose. Not one person from the organization would speak to me further about the issue. I've been told dozens of times about how they're sorry but they simply don't make those decisions. What's really shocked me is that my resume and essay we're not even looked at because of admitting the condition.I have been hiding my mental health ever since my diagnosis. It has not affected my professional life or my work. I am high functioning and need no more accommodation than a healthy volunteer whatever that is. Having them reject me for checking the wrong box made me incredibly angry and hurt. But instead of accepting this I've been fighting it for the past 2 months. I've called senators lawyers mental health advocacy groups and have begun the informal resolution process with their Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. When they asked what I hoped to get out of this process I told them that I want to be medically cleared and that I want them to put an end to this discriminatory process. Odds are they will not give me an inch so I am prepared to take this to District Court there was a case in 1996 where a volunteer was rejected because she admitted to taking antidepressants. The court ruled in her favor and this decision gives me hope.The most exciting development will come the end of this month. Patrick J. Kennedy nephew of John F. Kennedy who coincidentally founded the Peace Corps will be coming to my city to advocate for mental health rights. Patrick Kennedy was diagnosed with bipolar himself so I'm doing everything in my power to go to the conference and talk to him get him a letter anything if there's an offhand chance to get him to lobby the PC on my behalf I need to take it.I'm not giving up this fight until I receive my letter of acceptance or until they tell me stop calling us or we will contact the police. I will let you guys know the newest updates as they come up if you have any ideas for me on how to fight this archaic government process please throw your ideas here.As always never give up trying new things to get your condition under control. It is possible and things will get better if you try.,Bipolar
49890,Want to go off meds without getting divorced I want to go off of my meds. Ive been on them for years but they are not helping enough anymore. Ive gone off lithium before and that went fine. I tried going off Invega but I couldnt keep my shit together. If I get the chance again Ill probably just lie to get off finally. I like lamictal but it has a lot of sideffects so Id like to get off of that too. I love my sleep med roserum. I got off of and had really bad withdrawal from lorazepam but it helps my major panic issues. So Id keep that but use it sparingly.My husband said hed seriously consider divorcing me if I go off of my meds. Im kind of devastated. We were together before I got diagnosed and medicated. We never had a bad relationship while I was off meds. I did some stupid shit occasionally but we got though it more easily than a lot of the shit Ive done medicated. He drank like a fucking fish got increasingly violent and acted like I shot him when I said Id divorce him if he didnt stop. He was sober 1 month. 1. And while infinitely better still has episodes of drinking way too much.

49989,How to find success starting a new job with bipolar disorder? I just accepted a job offer yesterday for a new job I will be starting in a couple of weeks. This will be my first adult fulltime job so I'm feeling pretty excited and a little nervous at the same time. I wanted to reach out and ask if anyone has any tips when it comes to starting a new job for people on the bipolar spectrum since we face unique challenges. How have you found success? What do you wish you did differently?,Bipolar
45398,Hypersexuality I was diagnosed with bipolar unspecified at 13 and I'm a young adult now. I didn't actually find out about my diagnosis until last year because my parents worked really hard to conceal it from me. The most recent discovery has been learning that believe it or not I wasn't just a normal horny teenage boy. I have nearly crippling hypersexuality as a cute little side effect of my bipolar. I don't really want to turn this into a nsfw thread unless it can't be helped but how do you ever cope with this? I'm a severe pornography addict to the point where I can't function if I don't get my daily fix I have painful shaking fits and the like. It's been like this since I was 11. I'm not asking for medical advice or anything like that I'm just curious if there is any hope for me.,Bipolar
45960,New BP1 I was recently admitted for a short involuntary stay at the county hospital psychiatric ward. My so took me because I had a breakdown last Monday amp cut myself and was threatening suicide and really wanted it. I was so scared and angry with my so for forcing me to go. I was screaming and crying. The hospital itself was dirty and it was overcrowded. I slept for 12 hours and then woke up to be told I was being admitted to my surprise because despite my arm being cut up I felt okay and wanted to go home. The unit I was taken to was the only available one and it was a schizophrenic unit. Wow the things i saw and experienced were remarkable. I left with a bipolar 1 diagnosis and it makes a lot of sense to me and am started on Latuda for about a week now and dont feel any different. Cut again on Monday. Hoping for a break in this depression. ?,Bipolar
49832,Voluntary or Involuntary Admission? I have read quite a few posts that talked about how their doctor told them that they might be admitted as involuntary if they didn't go in voluntarily. But didn't they just change it to Involuntary once you were at the hospital? Whenever I have gone to the ER willingly the moment the ER doctor interviews me I immediately get formed. Even when I was willing to stay voluntarily I was always admitted as an involuntary patient.Has this been the case for anyone else? If not how did you convince them to admit you voluntarily?,Bipolar
50165,I read a book cover to cover today I used to annihilate chapter books in a few hours. This year I completely lost my ability to focus. I am failing classes for the first time in my life. For contrast I have a full ride university scholarship. I haven't been able to focus on textbooks for a few months but haven't done real leisure reading in easily a year. Not because I don't want to just because I can't put in the time.Today I read an entire book 432 pages in under 24 hours. I am so proud of myself. I haven't done this since middle school and I remember every part of it I didn't just skim it.I don't want to get into the circumstances surrounding it or what it means as part of a larger whole.

46150,Unmanageable seroquel side effects after two years I've been on seroquel for about two years now and over the last couple of months I've developed side effects that I can't handle anymore and I don't know what to do. My pdoc prescribed adderall about a year and a half ago to counteract the sedation I feel even after taking my meds at night. Lately my muscles are so stiff and sore I can hardly move and sometimes it hurts so much I can't do anything but just cry. After taking my meds and laying down in bed my nose stuffs up out of nowhere and I can't breathe at all and my heart starts pounding and when I try to breathe out of my mouth and finally start falling asleep I can feel my breath slowing down and I panic that I'm going to stop breathing and I jerk awake. My legs are so restless and twitchy and I get so frustrated and I can't breathe and I don't know what to do other than just sob and wait it out until the seroquel knocks me out. This lasts for an hour or two every night. I don't even want to take the meds anymore because I know how shitty I'm going to feel. I don't even want to go to sleep anymore. I know when I tell my pdoc she's just going to try to convince me to switch back to lithium which I will never do. I had horrible painful acne so bad I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror without sobbing and wanting to die her response was wear makeup.Has anyone else had side effects like these? I don't know what changed recently and why I'm feeling this way after being relatively stable for so long. ,Bipolar

49788,Every time Im manic I want to cheat on my boyfriend Im currently manic and I cant stop thinking about it. Its like this almost every time Im manic. Its especially bad since Ive caught him cheating on me more than once so now my brain can justify it. I get extremely hypersexual when Im manic and I find have my sex with someone that Ive been having sex with for awhile extremely boring. I want new and exciting the thrill of sleeping with someone Ive never had sex with. I know this makes me seem like a shitty person but I just cant stop thinking about it despite knowing how wrong it isEdit to add I am not going to cheat I am able to reason enough to know I wont but that doesnt mean the thought isnt there I had to come off of the meds I was on due to pregnancy and it being known to cause birth defects. I go see my psychiatrist again soon to get started on something pregnancy safe hes just been out of town. Just because you personally have never experienced this feeling does not mean its not a thing. Everyones experience with mental illness is different. I am aware that mania is not an excuse to cheat when not manic I have no desire to seek attention or sex elsewhere. An open relationship ethical non monogamy is a no go for him. Hes ironically way too jealous for any of that and has made it very clear he has no interest in such a thing especially anything involving me being with another person.

49737,Tips on finding employment after quitting job due to BP? This is all very hypothetical for myself but I'm hoping others reading have insight. I am in the US.I'm in a job that often triggers me for various reasons. I've been in a almost constant depressive episode for the past almost two months. The exception is some hours of natural easehappiness from spending time with a few nonjudgmental friends throughout that time. My work performance has tanked and it's becoming an issue. I have coworkers talking to my boss about it and I don't blame them but my boss is trying to be nice about it to a degree that makes me worry that I'm taking his reputation.I will be doing an outpatient treatment program in the next few weeks. I am already on intermittent FMLA but the current plan which i do not like much is to do parttime work in the afternoons at my current job while i do the program in the mornings.I just had an anxiety attack after getting a phonecall from my boss to talk about it. I feel like the end is near but my boss and a few coworkers are still trying to be on my side and I see that. However i need to leave sooner or later. I used references to get this job I've been in it for just under a year that were absolutely glowing from people I respect. Quitting is embarrassing for me and I wonder how much it will reflect on them. I don't feel comfortable using them as references any more. I have a long job history on my resume with a new job about every three years. But i think it will look weird if i don't use anyone from those jobs as references.My main question isAssuming I don't have references how do I find a job? I'm 30 I live alone because I have a hard time with roommates. I know i can be the problem but I always try to resolve any conflict and the older I've gotten the better I've gotten but I also am in a difficult place emotionally and am having a hard time focusing and functioning. I feel like I'm at the edge and yet there's a light at the end of the tunnel of treatment if i can just figure out how to do this job a little bit longer and find something else that can help me keep my home and continue my medications and therapy.Feels like a tall order.TLDR Assuming I don't have references how do I find a job as someone in their 30s?,Bipolar
46336,First time posting on reddit... need helpadviceinspiration for dealing with a bipolar depressive episode Hello there.I am 23 years old and officially got diagnosed with bipolar type 1 about a year and a half ago after being hospitalized from a monthlong manic episode. after that I was on EI for 4 months and had to take a break from school. Basically it ruined my life.The meds helped me remain stable with a little bit of depression here and there.. nothing major. For the past 5 weeks I have fallen into a deep depression. I am crying on the floor feeling physically paralyzed can't see my friends and having very dark thoughts. I saw my psychiatrist and therapist last week and we upped my meds. I am now on 200mg Lamictal 60mg Latuda and 100 mg Modafinil. I also started light therapy work out 4 days a week take vit d iron and omega 3s meditate and am starting CBT therapy next week. I feel like I'm doing all of the right things.. which is why i feel SO frustrated that nothing seems to be working. Oh and I got my hormonal IUD taken out as my naturopath said it might be causing my mood problems.I don't want to die. There is so much more I want to do in life. But being severely depressed is no way to live.People with bipolar... what med combos are you on? What other therapy has worked for you? How did you get better? I need some hope in my life right now...Thanks all in advance. It was hard for me to post this.,Bipolar

For example depending on my episode I crave candy or turkey sandwiches or goldfish and string cheese.

49482,How soon do you tell someone youre starting to date? I am currently in the process of getting divorced but looking towards the future and getting back in the dating scene I realized I have absolutely no idea what Im doing! My exhusband was with me when I was diagnosed so its never something I had to really tell him about. I have bipolar II and overall it has been fairly well controlled until recently in going through this divorce. I had a severe for me hypomanic episode followed by a severe depressive episode but now am back on meds picking up the pieces and getting back to a feeling of normalcy. I know that the stress of dealing with my addict ex plus the stress of the divorce absolutely contributed to the severity of these episodes so Im hopeful that moving forward I will continue to be well managed. My concern is that in dating someone eventually I would want them to know what Im dealing with but I understand people who would not want to be with me due to this condition. Obviously telling someone deep mental health stuff on a first date would be offputting but Im just wondering if any of you have found a good way to handle this appropriately??

49776,Long Lasting Mania? I had spinal surgery last July and since then I feel like I've been extremely manic. I've gotten over 20 tattoos on my body and have spent all of my income as it comes in. I have 11 more scheduled and that is with me really weeding out some of the ones I don't really want. I have been oddly stable but manic at the same time some days stretching many days without need for sleep. My brain doesn't shut off.Is it possible to have long lasting mania that lasts more than 6 months? I'm terribly manic right now and I fear the hypomania that is impending. I feel that my mania will last as long as I keep getting tattoos but getting them is preventing me from being depressed as they make me very happy. I don't know I'm a mess right now.,Bipolar
45678,Some tips to save on Latuda I keep seeing a ton of posts about how expensive Latuda is for people and of course many posts about how helpful it has been. I must say for myself it has been helpful with the depression but its certainly not a fix all for me. So with that I wanted to share some tips of what I have encountered along the way with trying to afford and stay on this medication. There are some options or relief available. Not sure I'd call them solutions but instead kind of bandaids. Ultimately it wont get better until generics come out but from what I have read it doesn't look like the patent will run out till like 2026 or thereabouts.When you get the script from the doc make sure to ask about samples if they are not provided first off. I got lucky and I have to say I was on this med for probably a good 3 months just on samples alone. Perhaps my practice is a bit more forgiving on that front. I told them I had problems with getting the cost which I did so they gave me more samples to hold me over till payday. There were also times I ran out before the pharmacy could get an order in and in which case they gave me samples to hold me over till I could get filled. Get the discount card!!! It says pay as little as 15 which for me brought my cost down to 150. Not great but far less than what it was. Latuda copay Assistanthttpssecure.latuda.comsecurelatudasavings.cfm. Check if you have a preauthorization requirement for this drug. Unfortunately this might require you to call your insurance company directly. Some pharmacies might be able to tell you if its required. For me if my pdoc didnt submit a preauthorization the cost for me was near retail which is about 1300US. Check if you have a prescription deductible. I did and at the beginning of every year it renews. So I was surprised to find that my drug I was getting for 150 was now ringing up at 400. Sadly the only way past this is to pay it. But once paid my cost was back down. McKesson the company that provides the discount card will also provide you with two 14day supplies of latuda at no cost. That is right FREE. Just today I got my second free 14day supply of latuda. Call them up at 18555LATUDA and you can speak to a rep to get this. They will provide you with the info that is used the same as another discount card. Lastly I was told of another option they have available where they will supposedly try to negotiate a lower cost with the insurance company. I'm not sure what kind of success rate there is with this as I have not yet attempted to go this route. This will be my last ditch effort before telling doc its too much and have to find something else. In order to do this you would call the same number above 18555LATUDA and inquire talk to someone about what options are available and perhaps inquire specifically about negotiating how much the insurance costpay. I only found out about this one as my insurance is always rejected with the card so I called the card company to sort it out and was somehow transferred to a rep that informed me this is what her department did before transferring me to another. Anwyays hope this helps some of you. The preauthorization and deductible points should apply to all medications and is something to consider. Its possible that the other solutions might work with other medications as well if they are cost prohibitive. Edit Looks like the patent does expire on July 2 2018. So perhaps there is hope for a generic sooner than later.,Bipolar
50137,How do I accept that I am far less capable now than I was before? I had big plans growing up. I was while horrible with anything math excellent in all other school subjects. Now I can barely write a paragraph without losing focus. This disease has seriously messed me up. It's given me anxiety and inferiority and cognitive blocks that no nonBP person has to face.I just want to come to terms with it. I don't know what my abilities are how smart I am anymore. I'm certainly not capable of any kind of degree or a job anymore. I can't learn a trade or skill. I couldn't be an electrician or an engineer or a programmer or a writer.All I want more than anything is a purpose. I would take a job even if I wasn't paid. I can't volunteer though. I'm simply not smart enough anymore. I'm dumber than a rock now.How do I just come to terms with the fact that I will essentially be forced to live with an eighth of my prior capacity for the rest of my life? That I will never be able to enjoy an interesting article or cook for myself ever again because of the constant apathy and misery of persistent depression.Edit It's been about a day and I was feeling really shitty for the past few weeks.

46975,Could i have Bipolar instead? Hey there. My psychology assignment for my final term is to research an illness of which I chose bipolar. I chose this because my Dad is diagnosed with Bipolar and i wanted to learn more. Looking at it has made me start questioning my own mind as well.I have recently been diagnosed with ADHDPI. However doing research i've found that ADHD and BD can be mistaken for eachother sometimes because of similar symptoms. BD runs in my family through my dad and yet i'm not aware of anyone else in my family with ADHD which is supposedly hereditary as well. I have also had issues with depression and self destructive tendencies for a long time. History of alcoholism and pseudo substance abuse after failing school for 3 years and a seemingly innate ability to tell myself that i will never succeed and that i do not deserve anything other than misery and seemingly becoming hellbent on proving that voice right.However while i do feel that i have cycles where suddenly out of nowhere i'll just get depressed and basically zombified for a period of time I don't feel that the mania symptoms strike me at all. I do have periods where i will suddenly be very happy and everything is great silver linings in everything and sign up for lots of different clubs or take new courses etc. But i've seen it state an increased or grandiose sense of worth or feeling that you are good at everything and I have never experienced that i guess.Am i just being a hypochondriac or is this something that any of you can relate to? I don't really know if i'm just being in my head or not. Thanks for reading.,Bipolar
45993,Medication Frustration Triiger warning mentions suicide and ED long I am new here 36 f and have commented some but this is my first post. I started a little over four years ago to try and find some relief from all the bad things going on in my mind. The only other time I had been to a Dr to help with my ongoing mental issues was when I was 22 and in college. A GP prescribed me Zoloft and up the dosage a couple times and then basically didn't schedule any follow up appointments. I basically went full out party mode and made terrible decisions lacked impulse control and was hyper sexual and engaged in a lot of risky behavior that I am still embarrassed about even today. I eventually stopped taking the zoloft after about a year because my ex found out I was taking it and he said I had no right to be depressed because my life wasn't that badhe was very emotionally abusive. My father was bipolar and we lost him to suicide and my sister is also bipolar. I had no idea that antidepressants alone could trigger a hypomanicmanic episode in some one with bipolar.I knew that there was always something not right with me I would have terrible bouts of depression. I attempted suicide at 14 luckily it didn't work I just screwed up my stomach and I never told my parents. My family never talked about emotions. I didn't even know my dad was bipolar until after his death. My mom said he never believed it and refused to take medication for bipolar. Fast forward to about four years ago I break down and tell my husband that I can't take it anymore and need help. I never admitted it to him but I had a plan for suicide and it scared the shit out of me. On the outside my life seemed great married to my husband who is amazing and the love of my life we have two healthy kidsI also have an older children from my previous relationship and I am a stay at home mom which is something I really wanted. I had extreme anxiety and depression though. I started seeing a therapist who eventually said I needed to see a psychiatrist because I most likely needed meds because my issues were not going to be resolved with therapy alone. I started meds and did an inpatient program for Eating Disorders because I had an existing ED and felt myself falling back into old bad habits in order to deal with my anxiety. The ED treatment was great but my depression and anxiety were still out of control. I told my psychiatrist back my past with zoloftI was finally realizing my behavior while taking it was probably caused by being on it alone. We tried a few antidepressants and they all made me feel irritable or angry. My Dr then starts adding mood stabilizers and antipsychotics to the mix. I look up more on bipolar disorder and start to think that maybe what's wrong with me especially with my family history. I ask my Dr if she thinks I am bipolar and she says no because I don't have any type of hypomanicmanic episode and says she changed my diagnosis to mood disorder. We try a bunch of different combos either they don't work or the side effects are so bad I can't handle them. All things she is prescribing me is medication for bipolar disorder. After three years she then starts prescribing me things I already tried and didn't work the first time. I got a new Dr. The new Dr asks right away if my old Dr thought I was bipolar after I give her the list of meds I have already tried. I see her a couple times and she says she thinks I am bipolar and my extreme attacks of anxiety that come along with not sleeping and being paranoid and suicidal are episodes of dsyphoric hypomania. I am now on my third med change with this Dr. All together I have been on 30 different meds in a little over 4 years. I am so frustrated. I am always med compliant I really want something to work. I was just on Fetzima and lamotrigine. I am so irritable and can't sleep. So my Dr took me off the Fetzima because she thought it was what was causing me problems I think it might be the lamotrigine. She said it was unlikely but I had the same trouble with Vraylar and Rexulti. I am now on the lamotrigine oxcarbazepine and mitrazapine. It's been a week off Fetzima and I am still extremely irritable and not sleeping well. Sorry about the life story. I am just so frustrated and want something to work but I feel like I am starting to run out of options.,Bipolar

49682,Im new Im very recently diagnosed in conjunction w ASD. Im just very scared of my head Im scared of the way my brain makes me think and I am scared of how little control I have over it. Ive no idea what world Ive entered into mostly because I dont understand much yet despite wanting to. Ive studied psychology at university before dropping out multiple times and its so easy to look at things on the outside and understand them but to look introspectively is so difficult. Its difficult to analyse the thoughts I should and shouldnt listen to. Its difficult to place or recognise moments of irritability excitement etc. Sometimes Im panicking without even knowing Im panicking or why. Im just very much in a state of barely knowing whats going on in my head until the aftermath unless its depressive thoughts those are pretty easy to figure out and by far the most common for me. People near me just say I shouldnt think that way but its hard explaining why I feel I have no control over how I genuinely feel if that makes sense. Does it get better? Ive been prescribed mood stabilisers.,Bipolar
45485,finally got up the courage to go to the Psychiatrist. I'd been hesitant.. scared.. wary.. about going before. Thoughts racing through my head of what a diagnosis would mean for me. My pdoc didn't feel comfortable giving me a diagnosis for anything other than general anxietydepression and recommended I go to a specialist so I could get more accurate treatment. Took me well over a year to finally go. I'd made appointments and blew them off never actually going. I'm so glad I did now.I had to get over the fact that I would get diagnosed with 'something' and it would be on my medical records. I guess I had some preconceived notion that it would never go away and there would be some sort of stigma attached to me everywhere I go. Irrational as that may sound it is what prevented me from seeking professional help.I finally went this past Monday spent an hour with a P.A. talking about my history what meds I am currently on LexaproWellbutrin from my pdoc etc. She took that information and talked to one of their head Psychiatrists about it then came back about 15 minutes later with him. He was very nice understanding and seemed genuinely interested and concerned about my care. My personal research proved to be right. I have Bipolar II. I felt an inner sense of calmness and clarity now that I had a professional someone that has spent their life studying conditions such as this verifying that yes indeed there was something amiss in my brain. And that better help was coming.Lexapro had been working WONDERS for my anxiety and slightly for depression as well. Wellbutrin didn't seem to do much but made life liveable. I was not thriving or excited about anything. Just going through the motions.He took me off Wellbutrin and replaced it with a mood stabilizer Trileptal. I stopped the Wellbutrin cold turkey and started Trileptal that same night. I had a really good Tuesday and today is looking great as well. I feel much better now that I was finally able to get over myself and get proper help and hopefully better meds to balance my moods. I have a follow up appointment in 2 weeks. By then I hope to see even more positive changes with the Trileptal.I also chose to stop drinking cold turkey as well. I knew I had been drinking too much for too long. Each time I drank it was 6 beers and sometimes 45 nights a week. It became routine. A way to quell my mind at the end of the night. To slow the racing thoughts. It took the words from the Psychiatrist to really cement it in my brain that alcohol counteracts anti depressants and that in order to feel better I would need to make a lifestyle change. He said the Trileptal would assist in those nighttime racing thoughts.I even stopped smoking cannabis. This happened after I started the Wellbutrin. I think that can be attributed to the fact that Wellbutrin is somewhat of a cessation tool used for people quitting cigarettes. The urge or desire to smoke which used to be daily just stopped. I don't care anymore. It doesn't really do anything for me. Even with my MMJ card and specific strains all it really did was numb me and slow my brain down again like with Alcohol to slow the racing thoughts. So without the alcohol and cannabis I feel strongly that I can finally let my mind be a blank slate for the psych meds to work properly and not be counteracted or made less effective by other psychoactive chemicals.I am committed to feeling better and if drinking La Croix instead of beer helps in any way I'm all for it. I want to be able to let the meds do their job in the most effective manner.Thanks for being here community. I may not post much but do lurk frequently and have gleaned a ton of helpful insights over time since I have been subbed.I hope you all have a wonderful day!,Bipolar

45900,Unstable bipolar people giving people with bipolar a bad name. I've made forays into dating and I've encountered people who've had bad experiences with unstable bipolar people. Whether it's because of being unmedicated or a comorbid mental illness such as borderline these bipolar people have hurt others and left a bad impression of what people with the medical condition of bipolar are like. However maybe the impression is justified in the sense that almost all people with bipolar bring unnecessary drama to mentally healthy people? When I was unmedicated I know the mania caused trouble. And even medicated I still have some issues and understand that medication only lessens the frequency duration and severity of episodes and does not fully stop it. It makes me sad when I think that maybe no one good will love me because they can do so much better in the sense that they can find someone without bipolar and the baggage that I carry. ,Bipolar
46169,Tell me about Lamictal lamotrigine Hey Yall I'm Bipolar type 2 currently on 20mg cymbaltaand regular dose of dioxizine and clonidine which doesn't do muchI was on clonazapam for around 15 years till they pulled me off and it hasn't ever been the same. I've been off for about a year and a half now. My main symptons now are tons of anxiety and occasional panic lots of moodiness including intense fear anger and resentment especially to those I love and don't intend to hurt. I'm thinking of trying out lamotrigine have you guys had any luck with it. Of course I realize individual results will vary.. Thanks guys stay strong. ,Bipolar
47074,How many of you take or have taken Lamictal? Ive been on Lamictal for over 2 years. I started with small doses but as of August Ive been at 300 mg a day. The last couple months Ive been kind of foggy and just havent really felt like myself. If it is my Lamictal I dont understand why its just now happening since Ive been on it for so long. Its also made my mouth kind of numb for a couple hours after Ive taken it after I moved up to about 200 mg. Im curious about what other peoples experiences are.,Bipolar
45410,As a woman in my early twenties how do I build my trust in men and confidence in romantic relationships? Just in need of some advice. I am finally doing quite well dealing with being bipolar II diagnosed a year ago but I am finding some issues that are making themselves more apparent as I lean back in to the dating scene. Not only do my mental health issues make me nervous going into a relationship but I am noticing I have some real trust issues. My father was an alcoholic most of my life and was not present very often. I have not had many men in my life that I have been able to fully trust. I know where my trust problems come from but I am having trouble working on these issues. Anytime I meet a new guy and things are great as soon as they mention a good friend that is a girl my stomach just drops and I begin wondering if I can trust them. My first serious boyfriend also ended up dating his good friend right after we broke up and I think that is kinda adding to this thought spiral.I guess Im asking how can I come to terms with the fact that a guy could be unfaithful? Because of course I can never know for sure. How do I deal with that possibility without it making me push the person away out of fear? I get the worst feeling in my body just thinking about being in a relationship with someone and finding out that they secretly are very attracted to their friend that they just cant be with for whatever reason. Please help I want to have a positive relationship in my life but I am getting in the way of that. ,Bipolar
49698,Bye Bye Citalopram Ive been on a roller coaster the last 9 months with medication. I had started to think I had been misdiagnosed based on how terrible I have felt despite lithium and an SSRI plus Seroquel at bed. I even scheduled a new psych for a second opinion in April. Then through some bad juggling and admin by my GP my citalopram prescription was cancelled instead of renewed. The pharmacist gave me a loner box of meds but it was a lower dose. Fast forward a month later and Im still on the lower dose. Low and behold hallelujah I feel fantastically average. This aint no hypo and Im definitely not depressed. Wow. Im considering going to an even lower dose but my intake appointment is so close I feel like I should probably leave it for now. Woo!!,Bipolar
46125,BPII dx as of today after 5yrs of unhelpful MDD treatment! Well I've been half expecting this for awhile and wondering how I'd handle it if things went this way. I'm actually relieved. This partial hospital program I'm in has really hammered it home that no matter what I'd be dealing with a chronic episodic illness whether MDD or BP so the only real difference for me outlookwise is I might actually get some effective treatment now. I might not be treatment resistant now. I might not have to do ECT. I could cry. I'm getting up there on Lamictal with a bit of Vyvanse and I feel just... normal! Or what I imagined it would be like. Here's to hoping it's only up from here. I was already fighting for my life so I know it won't be easy by any stretch of the imagination but maybe now I'll have better help. This community is something special. Thanks for everything thus far.,Bipolar
50461,Forgetting episodes Does anyone else have holes in their memory from specific hypomania andor depressive episodes. When family have brought up situations where I was manic or depressed I generally have very little to no recognition of what theyre talking about and it usually takes a lot of detailing to get me to vaguely remember. Please tell me Im not alone its a little scary.,Bipolar
45819,Here we go again My therapist said I was hypomanic yesterday I don't know why she says this as I've been feeling stable as ever lately. I am having some sleep troubles yes but I'm not feeling sped up or anything. I suppose I have been engaging in some reckless spending and grandiose goaldirected behavior but that's about it. I mean it's possible but I'm not getting the buzzing I usually do when I'm hypo. Is it possible to be hypomanic and not be aware of it? I usually am which is the strange thing. ,Bipolar
46456,RISPERIDONE 1MG Tablet Hi everyone..Yesterday I saw a psychiatrist and he diagnosed me with bipolar schizophrenia manic depression and anxiety. He gave me this medication called risperidone in 1mg tablet form. After reading lots of negative posts online about it I'm terrified to take this. Suppose to take it in the morning not sure if that cause it could interact with my Tramadol prescription that is taken at night as a sleep aid. Was wondering if anyone may be comfortable sharing there experiences with this medication? Also how bad do you think it would effect the creative portion of ones mental state? Thanks in advance ,Bipolar
50285,Every. Single. Time. Every single time I think Im getting better Im just not. I thought I was healing but really I was masking my depressive symptoms with drugs. Now Ive ran out of drugs to binge on and I can feel myself spiralling into mania and I dont wanna sectioned again I just cant please someone help me,Bipolar
46015,Now that I'm finally balancing out I'm terrified how much of my life has passed and how bad I screwed things up It's been a long road but I've finally begun to get some normalcy in my life. I really went down the tubes for a while a long while and I made a lot of decisions that have left my old life way in the past. I feel like I have a twin old life me who had the life I wanted to have. Then it all fell to shit. Then there's current me the remaining other twin who's life is well crap. I mean I'm a loser not being down I just am. The thing that really freaks me out though is when I look back so much time has passed yet I feel stuck in cement going nowhere. I had suicidal ideation for years bad and that's gone away lately. Which is cool. I actually want to live again only problem is I can't shake the horror of all the time that's passed and how bad I fucked everything up and how low I have sunk. Anyone else deal with this? I'd love to hear any words of wisdom. ,Bipolar
50171,Bipolar disorder and adhd Hello does anyone have bipolar disorder and adhd ? Ive been taking adhd for the past decade . My therapist wanted me to get an evaluation since it had been a while . Turns out I have adhd severe anxiety and bipolar disorder . I take adderall and it helps me function never had issues with it . So Im wondering if I should get another opinion ? Or is it normal to have adhd in my case its severe and bipolar disorder. Just a little concerned since I have to find a new psychiatrist now.,Bipolar
46355,Finally done with Seroquel and Zoloft I know cold Turkey is so bad for you but I did it and successfully transferred to depakote and ritalin which has changed my days. I don't lay around wanting to die anymore. I don't want to eat everything in sight. And for the first time I'm organized. Seroquel 200mg is what I was taking until I started having chest pains and my clothes didn't fit anymore. 200mg zoloft fucked me up worse than anything. Especially the weird withdrawal. Seroquel made me sweat like a hoe in church quitting it. I'm so glad I stuck it out because I am definitely not a good candidate for seroquel or zoloft. I feel good. Not overly emotional or depressed. I feel like me again. ,Bipolar
46363,I feel like bipolar is ignored. Anyone know any good mental health nonprofits that actually support bipolar? I've liked TWLOHA since I was in high school because of their dedication to preventing suicide and they were really connected to the music scene I was into but now as I'm older and diagnosed I'll listen to their podcasts and watch their social media and there's nothing that ever acknowledges bipolar. Just depression and anxiety. I feel like most organizations are this way. They support anxiety and depression because they're the trendy things to support while things like bipolar borderline and schizophrenia are still too scary and inappropriate to mention. I'd really like to see an organization that recognizes bipolar and supports more mental illnesses than just depression and anxiety. Anyone know of any good ones? In the US so ones available in the US preferred.,Bipolar
46744,Beginning of an end I'm almost 21 years old and I can feel my life falling apart. I can't find the right medication. I'm gaining weight from my new one and can't stop eating. I got fired from my one job after being in the hospital. I'm failing half of my classes at college. I feel like because of my bipolar I'm just not made to be successful in life. I haven't been stable since early highschool. I'm so tired of rapid cycling and my moods shifting so fucking fast. I always used to say that I didn't want to live past 22 but that was even before my diagnosis. I can only see my life becoming more hopeless and I feel bad for my partner of almost a year that puts up with my bullshit. My mom says I wallow in self pity a lot and there's people worse off than me but how is that supposed to help me? I don't want to end up being on disability for the rest of my life I don't want to drop out of school because of this fucking disorder. But it just doesn't seem to end. ,Bipolar

46777,What do you consider the difference between Bipolar I and Bipolar II based on your perspective? I have Bipolar II and describe it as the sadder instead of madder version but I dont know if thats really accurate. My manic episodes are generally not dangerous and I have no temper or anger issues. But my depressive states are lengthy and horrid and dark and deadly. I only know what Ive endured though. ,Bipolar

46596,Medication help I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 when I was 15. I spent a lot of time in and out of inpatient psych and on a lot of meds. I had some success with Valproic acid but came off of it when I moved across the country about 2 years ago. I have yet to track down a psychiatrist because wait lists are long but after a really crippling few months of depression that cost me my job I went on 350mg of Wellbutrin XL. I have had really good luck with the Wellbutrin helping my depression I dont tolerate ssris at all. For about the past 6 weeks Ive been feeling like Im manic and its getting really hard to deal with now. I feel really impulsive and self destructive and I need help but I dont know where to get it. Should I go to a walk in clinic? Is there anything I can even go on without having to stop taking Wellbutrin because that has been the only thing that has ever helped the depression. Im not sure where to go or who to ask for help. Thanks in advance. ,Bipolar

Im a 24 year old female diagnosed in 2012 and I have always had struggles with facing the beast of medications organizing them and seeing it all in front of me gets so overwhelming I just dont. Even picking them up from the pharmacy is a lot to handle sometimes that I wait to pick them up. Or if at all.Whether its for my ADHD Bipolar pain management rx vitamins.. its always an internal struggle. The cognitive dissonance between knowing Im actively making the decision to not take them and knowing I want to get better is a difficult thing to face.

46920,Does anyone else have adverse reactions to touch when coming out of an episode? I just had a minor freakout over something I said basically I told my boyfriend I wasn't up for DampD tonight which he was okay with but I feel like I ruin everything and I hid myself away in the bathroom.I ended up getting really angry at myself during this and threw my phone at the wall which prompted my mother to come upstairs and ask what was going on. I blew up at her and told her everything's fine just please leave me alone which was obviously yelled not calmly spoken.I then moved to my room and started sobbing which prompted my boyfriend to come in and try to comfort me. We talked it out and I started to calm down but when he was rubbing my back it felt like my skin was burning so I pulled away. I don't really know how to describe it other than an adverse tactile reaction to touch. I notice it a lot after I have a breakdown like this.TLDR had minibreakdown lashed out and regretted it talked it out with boyfriend and when he tried to physically comfort me it felt like my skin was burning. ,Bipolar
49751,Bipolar and Grieving Soon after discovering Im bipolar I realized that it clearly affects the way I grieve. Throughout the year I was 2324 I lost 12 people I was close to in a wide variety of ways it was too much for my brain so I just didnt process it. I didnt feel like I had the time. At 26 I lost a cousin who I had greatly looked up to and I still wasnt processing so I started therapy which helped me move on from the then 13 deaths. This was also prior to medication. At this time I am now medicated and Im grieving a brother a grandmother and an aunt who all died of separate causes though two died on the same night. All in the span of February. Its again too much for my brain. Way too much. Like in the universe of shitty fuckery I have dealt with which is a lot this really takes the cake. My brain is bouncing all over. From sobbing with utter despair and literally being unable to pick myself up off the floor to being so manic that I want to tear my hair out and break everything around me so instead I manic clean to just existing. I havent even been able to return to work and its almost April. I raised my brother and I feel like I didnt just lose a brother. I lost a son and a friend. Every stage of grieving just feels pointless. Its too much. I dont know what to do,Bipolar
49723,Coming off Seroquel Okay so around this time last year I went on Seroquel IR due to unable to sleep and depressive symptoms. That shit rocked me and I couldnt handle being a zombie 16 hours a day. So I switched to XR a couple months later. Well jump to now I want to come off it. One I think the depressive symptoms are mainly gone. I just cant handle the side effects any more. The constant hunger that cant be ignored so hard to wake up at in the AM ect. I know this is bad but I stopped taking it for a few days because of hypomanic episode and it wasnt the episode but not being on it that made me feel so much fucking better. Like I could breathe.Im still on lamotrigine and want to go up more since my mood has been a little whacky so Im obviously not on nothing. But have people gone off Seroquel after a bad depressive episode and was your psych on board or did they make you switch meds? Did you just fall back into a depression? Please just let me know any of your stories. Thanks all,Bipolar

I know that sounds like a gross exaggeration but its not as much of a strech as the normies would assume. I feel so alone and everything is darker. Even visually i see more shadows than are really there. And the demigorgon is always just around the corner not a real one but a metaphorical one that represents deep anxiety.This year i promised myself i wouldnt let it happen again. I telling people i needed help but they didnt really seem to get it. I started asked for small accommodations in august but i didnt get any of what i needed till late December. Its too late now im stuck in the upsidedown for another season because people thinks i was just complaining about the winter blues.The lithium really takes the edge off.

49940,Stopped lamictal and noticed how it was affecting me I've been off of lamictal for a week now after developing mild rash symptoms.Interestingly and unbeknownst to me I noticed it had been changing my behavior.Since being off I'm less irritable more social and more creativefunny.The downside is that my sleep schedule is now shit and that my swings are back to what they used to be which isn't all that bad since my depressive swings have always been mildmoderate it's the hypomania thats the slightly problematic one but I'm aware of when it's setting in.Don't really know how to proceed really because the trade offs don't really seem worth it for me. I Uber so I can drive when I want and the hypomanic impulsivity isn't really something I think I can't handle. Should I just go back to rawdogging life? I just wish I had normal brain chemistry. Sleep hygiene is the biggest detriment but I feel like I'm giving up too much of myself for it.,Bipolar
50272,What kind of therapy do you do? I haven't had a therapist for a while because I felt like it wasn't working for me. I am very self aware which just seems to make it difficult. I can describe my feelings and thoughts well so they don't understand why I'm struggling. It's like just because I can articulate it or locate the source of the problem doesn't mean I'm actually working through it. Does anyone else have this problem?

45651,Just got my med approved my insurance Some of you know that I've been on saphris and lithium for the past year with really really good results. I've never felt this stable in my life. My insurance company sent me a letter late last week saying they would no longer cover saphris and I'd have to try a small list of acceptable APs... most of which I've tried the last of which wouldn't work for other reasons. After several days of phone tag with my doctor and two pharmacies she was able to get a hold of my insurance... and convince them I'm their client seriously? and she just called me back to say it's been authorized. I can stay on saphris.I had given up. I was already thinking of the worst case situation and let's be honest kinda freaking out. I'm just posting this because I want to give hope to anyone who is in the same situation and I want to remind all of you to freak it if the worst comes to pass not in case the worst comes to pass. Anxiety is a bitch and I'll probably struggle with it for the rest of my life but I can also choose to counter my anxiety with rational positive thoughts. I can reframe the situation. I don't need to be a slave to my own worst case thinking. Has anyone been able to get psych meds specially approved? Just curious about your experience.,Bipolar

I'm not alive right now.So I'm thinking lithium is probably destroying me more than helping me because depression is my problem not so much mania. I have experienced a bit of hypomania it was very uncomfortable but I popped Seroquel when it got bad and it passedSo I think I really need to try lamictal. What should I tell my ARNP?

MarchApril is one of my depressive times and instead of being crippled by my emotions I was proactive. I spoke with my psychiatrist earlyon so that he could make the right medication adjustments to keep the episode from getting worse.

46323,Anxiety level 1000000 Husband's surprise Christmas present For Christmas my husband bought me a 6 week training program at a local boxing club. I've never done classlike exercising so I was pretty concerned that my social anxiety would be a problem. I was right.The training program includes a strict meal plan and weekly weighins. If you lose 20 lbs in 6 weeks then you get all your money back. Unfortunately it's triggered my eating disorder and now I'm restricting like a mofo.The first class I went to I had to sit out part of the time because I almost passed out. I've done 3 classes so far and it's incredibly embarrassing when I have to take a break to sit down while everyone else is still up and punching their bags.I know I shouldn't compare myself to everyone else because I'm just a beginner and they might not be but I can't help it.I think it's sending me into a depressive state.

49678,What to actually do during a depressive episode? Hi! So Im seeing a psychiatrist for my depression and I might be bipolar. Im on medication now but its not working yet. I have more energy than before but burned down my studies and social life because of my depression and I still feel like shit.Im not bad enough for inpatient and theres no intensive outpatient where I am and I barely have therapy. I dont know what to do Im glad Im not just crying staring into nothingness and sleeping anymore.

How can I fill my days in a nontoxic way?,Bipolar
50047,How do I stop spending money??? Ill preface this post with the fact that I have bipolar and Im young. I know both those things contribute to the impulse of money spending. I am still in college and my parents give me money for necessities groceries therapy gas money to visit home. I DID have a regular job but I quit because of how toxic the workplace was. I babysit pretty regularly and I am in the running for a job as a ghost tour guide so its not like I CANT afford frivolous things but I do feel bad about not having basically any money in my savings 20 to my name right now! Its insaneI am no longer someone who buys clothes just because I like them but I did go up a few sizes due to medication increase and diet change so Ive been having to replace a lot of my old clothes. I always shop at goodwill though and lately I havent had to buy that much. I dont buy house decor anymore since I am definitely fulfilled in that aspect. I only buy art supplies when my current ones are totally out of use.I think I impulse buy fast food or even restaurant food super easily when I can just cook it or use my meal plan at school. I only have to pay 1k2k per year at school due to scholarships and financial aid but its still a big chunk my parents now pay half ever since I quit my job. My biggest vice however is legos. I buy so many legos especially when Im feeling anxious. Theyre a super efficient distraction and a really engaging hobby. Even my parents support it because they see how it calms me and makes me happy. But my issue is that whenever I get any sort of significant money I immediately go to buy legos. I dont know how to stop or budget or anything or put any of it into a savings account without just taking it right back out. Its like every other week at this point.I need help. How do you all save money? You all know what I do and dont spend it on so do you have any tips?,Bipolar
50273,Losing friends over diagnosis? Just semi recently some people who I considered long time friends and I truly believe its because I was being more open about my diagnosis. For context they has DID and alters and I tried to accommodate for them as much as I could. Yet they randomly removed me after we spent a few weeks together it was a visit I dont really know what went wrong as I took my meds and I have a passive nature in general. No manic outbursts or emotional ones at all. We all were laughing and having a great time laughing and doing fun activities. But as soon as I got home one of them just didnt want anything to do with me anymore. And I truly believe it was discriminatory behavior because I would bring up my diagnosis make jokes of because they would do the same. Making jokes of my diagnosis helps me cope in a way It took me bit to collect myself but Im doing a whole lot better with therapy now that theyre not in my life anymore. They were also very against seeking medical advice for mental illness and rather get high and not address their issues with a professional. Has anyone else here ever lost close friends that backstabbed you over your diagnosis? Or is it better for people with this disease to just keep everyone at arms length and give the cold shoulder out of fear of discrimination or assumptions on what they think bipolar is? Most people dont judge by the content of your character anymore and its so incredibly sad it has to be that way,Bipolar
49758,some questions I have adhd and my psychiatrist suspects I have cooccurring bipolar ll. i dont know how i feel about that cuz it seems like theres a fair bit of overlap between adhd and bipolar symptoms even though theyre completely different conditions. here are some questions i have how does cooccurring adhd affect bipolar symptoms?how does hypomaniamania look different than a mood shift related to adhd? if youve ever just been on stimulant medication what was your experience?,Bipolar
50309,Help Im tired of it all Before I get into this I know I was an asshole and I regret it so much that Im crying. Thats why Im here to ask so I dont have to be judged by people I know. Ive been fine for a while surprisingly considering Ive been off my meds for a while. But yesterday was rough. I was starting to feel depressed and numb again so I did everything I could to keep it at bay. I went out I tried to do hobbies spend some time outside. But then my anxiety and paranoia started setting in. I feel like I was being watched and veery sound the woods made freaked me out. Eventually I couldnt stand it anymore and had to go inside and go to bed. Something to note Ive been off my meds but just recently realized I was a fucking idiot and am moving back onto them. For context of the next day I took some hydroxyzine last night to help me calm down and sleep. I tend to wake up a bit groggy but it fades. But today ive felt horrible. Ive been depressed irritable paranoid I just dont want to be here anymore dealing with it. I have a dog and because of our house set up I have to spend all day in the dining room with dining chairs and tile floor. No where to lay down. So I laid on the floor. Earlier I had been throwing a toy for my dog but stopped because my energy felt so low. As I was lying there she kept nipping at my heels and barking when I told her to stop. Finally my anger boiled over and I yelled at her. I said awful things to her that I dont want to repeat even to strangers on the internet. I put her in her crate and went to the bathroom to take a bath and calm down. I feel so awful about it and I hate feeling like this and hurting others. My medicine is supposed to help me but as soon as I started taking it again this happened. Help.,Bipolar
50308,New diagnoses I went for years thinking I had ADHD because of a childhood diagnoses of hyperactivity in the early 70s I'm 57 now. I was put on Ritalin than sedated me until it reversed and mad me worse.I got a diagnoses Of Asperger's syndrome at age 4o And thought the episodes were part of that . I Have been getting worse but I felt like superman when I was up and took it a a good state to be in Hardly the case people would be frightened of my actions which I could not understand why they wanted me to move faster at work cooking 40 years I would become increasing more agitated as the months would go on. and would just fly off the handle and have a melt down and bye bye job.I never felt out of control until recently when my father died in February and I have been on full throttle for a month now so I changed my Psych doc and said that I was manic and took me off the anti depresses that my old doc prescribed. and gave me abilify and buspirone Just wed mar 23 2023 it has been a month since I slept more than 2 hrs. I still up but I am coming down slowly.I never notice the down side I just knew that I felt better not moving as much to the neglect of housework and no motivation to give a dam about work again I had an attitude wile when I was down almost hatting the people I worked with and being resentful of having to work.ampx200Bsorry if this is disjointed I'm still amped up to 11.,Bipolar
46564,Brother committed diagnosed home. Still manic? My brother 26 was committed for a manic episode diagnosed bipolar and was released today. Immedietly drank with his buddies took the brand new truck he bought during this manic episode and blew up at my dad for making payments on his over drawn accounts. He was committed for 20 days but just started the bipolar medication about 10 days ago. He looks and sounds so much better but he's still talking about how intelligent he is and that he has all of his finances in order and knows what he's doing. I'm afraid he hasn't actually accepted the diagnosis or realised just how much of a mess there is to clean up. He started his own company this year and I'm scared to death all of his financial issues will get so much worse. He doesn't seem to care says he feels amazing and is planning on furthering his business. I guess my question is how do I approach him about this without seeming overbearing or telling him what to do? Should I wait and see if the meds just havent kicked in yet? What do you wish your family and friends did differently?,Bipolar
46163,Am i BiPolar? Ok so I have been struggling with these severe mood swings for almost 4 years. I thought it was just severe suicidal depression but recently within the past year i have been experiencing these nights or grouping of nights where I would stay up and do a ton of random projects and crazy work ideas. Nothing ever got done but after not sleeping and all I would crash. I would hit a depressing suicidal low and not know when it's going to end. Currently this is the longest depressive episode at almost 3 weeks. It's to the point where my grades went from A's to F's and my parents think it's anxiety. I go to a therapist but she doesn't know the full story. I also am being evaluated but that takes months. Ii am taking AP Psych in school and we are learning about mental illnesses and i realized i may be bipolar. 'm trying to keep family out of it while also getting help. Can someone help me? Do you think I have bipolar disorder?,Bipolar
50173,Anyone with comorbid bipolar and pssd? Wondering how you experience the combo. For me the anhedonia makes every hypomanic episode feel incredibly empty and frustrating. I just feel increased energy and irritability and never good. I never feel pleasure. Only thing i notice that improves is some motivation to socialize and date so i become very talkative and impatient but i never feel rewarded for the motivations i get. Its like an itch you cant scratch. The increased mental libido with sexual dysfunction is also extremely frustrating. Anyone relate?,Bipolar
50391,Bipolar depression got off meds 3 years ago I randomly get this overwhelming feeling of deep disgust when I get reminded I have a functioning body full of organs and tissue etc and I get this urge to just rip out everything Ive come close to it once but Im usually around people since I lack any privacy anywhere which Im not complaining to a extent but I had this same breakdown in front of my new bf and couldnt stop crying I tried to explain the fear and disgust but he was super freaked out and couldnt understand I dont understand it myself I just recently signed up for therapy again since Ive noticed more frequent episodes but therapy doesnt give me answers why I feel this way and I Im constantly asking myself questions and it causes migraines frequently my brain is so fried at this point I feel like its just lying to me constantly,Bipolar

45766,Is lithium making me manic or did I forget what good feels like? I have a new doc and at the same time new insurance that won't cover Latuda. My old doc hadn't tried lithium for whatever reason so this new doc is giving it a shot. I'm on a super low dose and while I titrate off the Latuda he's going to raise it in small increments.And I feel great! I'd been in a depressive episode for two weeks and that is out the window. I've been more productive this week than the past two months. I have a renewed sense of energy and positivity and somehow am less anxious too. Am I overreacting? Or is this the start of mania? The thing that's got me a little bugged out is that while I used to wake up groggy and hating the world I've woken up before my alarm clock went off. Last night I got an hour less sleep and felt like a million bucks today. Also unrelated but what do you lithium folks do about pain? I used to take 800mg ibprofen for my migraine and now I can't. Tylenol has done jack all for me in the past.,Bipolar
49483,How do I make friends as someone with bipolarsocial anxiety? I've never really had a best friend and at most I've had like 23 good friends and then a bunch of people who I'm friendly with but would never interact with outside of school college. I'm worried my bipolar is scaring people away. I feel like even thought most people don't know i have bipolar they know something is wrong with me it drives them away. I'm eccentric show up having a completely different mood than the day before...typical bipolar stuff and I just feel like people know I'm not right. or maybe there's other reasons I'm not good at having best friends. Out of my two closest friends I guarantee I am in neithers top 3 top 5 maybe not even top 10. Not even being self depricating I know it's true How can I be closer friends with people?,Bipolar

50323,Urge to trigger mania I recently had the most intense manic episode of my life and went on a whirlwind of euphoria rage etc... I had to miss work several days because I couldn't handle it and my mind was racing constantly. I'm relatively sure it was caused by me taking a few adderall pills not sure how much or the mg because that's when everything started. I crashed super hard and I'm so tired now and can't even indulge in my passions. When I was manic I was able to draw for 12 straight hours and then go to work the next day without even sleeping. I can't even pick up a pencil now and I'm so frustrated with myself. I want to be able to do that again and it's making me want to buy some adderall from a friend of mine but I know that it's not gonna do me any good in the end. I just wish I could do the things I like to do and not feel like shit I miss being on top of the world. I'm probably not gonna do it because I do remember how fucking horrible it was feeling so much all the time like that but god I miss the good parts. Hope anyone can relate to this lol,Bipolar

49534,decreased need for sleep difficulty taking meds im not sure where the best place to ask this is. im too afraid of bringing it up to my providers so im hoping i can seek support here before i mention anything.im diagnosed bipolar type 1 ive only had one manic episode that led to psychosis. mostly i struggle with rapid cycles of mixed mania hypomania and depression when unmedicated.the last maybe month or so? i guess ive had a decreased need for sleep. so much that my psychiatrist noticed it before i did and prescribed medicine for sleep. im taking my mood stabilizers regularly but for some reason i just cannot make myself take sleeping medication and these past two weeks ive noticed have been pretty worrisome while reflecting on itchange in sex drive and drugs unlike myself and putting myself in dangerous situations im just really afraid of bringing it up to anybody for fear of judgement. i know how silly it is to have the solution to my problem right in front of me and i dont want to make it seem like i dont care about my mental health.i am experiencing all symptoms of hypo?mania and some mixed features of depression. it was really nice for a few days of this week but just like my first manic episode the only way i can describe it is like youre going so high up on a roller coaster that when you feel it slipping down its scary and drastic and you do everything you can to keep going up just so it doesnt crash. i feel like im in the beginning stages of that and i really dont want to do this. the euphoria and attractiveness of mania is incredible but the constant racing thoughts and heart rate the irritability and anxiety are uncomfortable and i know im prone to psychosis.it seems like the easiest solution would be to actually take my prescribed medication but it is really hard for me. i feel like theres so much more time i have to get stuff done later in the night and i see it as a waste to go to bed so early especially when i dont need to. im aware of how ridiculous it all sounds but i dont know what to do to make myself take the medication. i know i have to but i genuinely just do not want to but unfortunately i know this is probably contributing to mania.any advice or support would be helpful. thank you all who read,Bipolar
46289,Just about to start work and I feel terrible After months of job hunting I finally got the job that I want through connections. In the past year I've gotten accepted in certain jobs but I quit the moment I felt like the job wasn't what was stipulated in the contract. This new job I got is legal and legit. This is the job that i really really want.But throughout the process of passing job requirements my enthusiasm just dwindled and panic or maybe dread is a better term to express what I feel. I don't know how I will handle this job after just being able to handle my bipolar moods. I feel jittery and i don't feel that I deserve this. I play around with thoughts of overdosing to feel more balanced but of course that's stupid and counterproductive.I didn't know where to post this and even opening up to my family and SO I feel like they can't really understand what I mean when I say these things.I just want to make this job last and I just want to have the courage to stick with it even if challenges or events overwhelm me.,Bipolar

46734,Vivid dream of psychotic break I've never had a dream like last night's before and I sincerely expected I would be on my way to the hospital when I woke up. In the dream I was hallucinating and detaching so vividly it seemed like a real episode and not a dream. I mean I know dreams have natural tendencies to be weird and surreal so to say I dreamt of hallucinating doesn't do justice to how it felt. The confusion and anxiety were so palpable and as I kept waking up and falling back asleep I felt the hallucinations weren't always limited to the sleep. However today I'm fine.It's got me kind of shaken because I've been really stable lately. Has anyone else had this kind of experience?,Bipolar

45739,Content Warning Florida and Media Representation of Mental Illness Reading of the news of another mass casualty in the US yesterday was first heartbreaking then infuriating. Every news outlet I saw pointed toward the focus on mental illness. POTUS went as far as saying that he wanted to tackle the complex problem of mental illness. WTF does that mean?Is he referring to ensuring that healthcare is readily available to Americans living with mental illnesses? Or that those who have mental illnesses will be receiving assistance in obtaining treatment?Why is it that the only time people speak to mental health as an issue as a priority is when a lot of people are dead? Why is the culpability always on mental illness and never on a negligent gun legislation? Here in Canada we have a make shift day of awareness that has its own set of problems because it is funded by a corporation that doesn't respect the mental health of its own employees. We're trying but we do have basic mental health coverage and care that isn't always afforded elsewhere. Folks outside of North America is this the same portrayal? ,Bipolar

46357,PSA Steroids And Worsening Of Bipolar Symptoms Disclaimer I am not a doctor so please always consult with yours when you seek medical treatment.I don't see this talked about enough. It's flu season and many of us may become sick and be prescribed steroids. Steroids have the chance of worsening bipolar symptoms and may send you into a mixed episode or manic episode or worse. If you are prescribed steroids please mention your bipolar diagnosis with your doctor. I'm sure there are cases of bipolar people that have taken steroids and have come out fine afterwards. I'm sure there are cases where a bipolar person is required to take steroids as there are infinite personally specific medical conditions and situations. But ask yourself these questions Have you disclosed your bipolar disorder to the practitioners prescribing steroids? Are you stable? Are you medicated? Do you have the resources to get emergency help should things go wrong? I was sick last year and prednisone almost made me kill myself. I had no idea that steroids could make my bipolar disorder worse. I spent over a week in hell as it left my system. Apparently it even awakens bipolar disorder in otherwise stable bipolars. If anyone has any evidence to the contrary or input or experience please post.

46413,Should I contact BP ex in this situation? Cross posted from rbipolar sos. My BP2 Dumped me last summer in the middle of a mixed episode. Her stated view was that it was because I had made too big a deal out of something to me when she was in a bad space. She left me on the day I had a pretty significant head injury. Because of various medical stuff she had going on at the time we didnt really speak much. We had been planning to marry and move together. That didnt happen. I was completely blindsided by all this. Three months later I left town for medical treatment. Even though she said she wasnt going to do this she completely ghosted me when I left.My treatment hasnt really worked. Eight months later now I am getting closer to being unable to do my work. It looks like I have CTE. I dont have a whole lot of support in life in terms of family and other people and Im losing my livelihood. My personality has changed. I am not planning to continue my life like this and I consider it a matter of maintaining some personal dignity in the face of whats going to be an unpleasant future. Yes Ive done everything I can and Im continuing to try but I live in the United States and theres not a real viable set of alternatives for me. I will probably end my life later this spring or in early summer when I can wrap up what I need to do to not leave a mess other people have to deal with. This question is not about that decision. I have my dignity and the prognosis isnt good.And I dont know because I cant tell whether she has ever come out of this phase or if shes still in it.Should I send her a letter and and tell her goodbye? Its the only unresolved relationship in my life. It would be especially helpful to hear from people with BP. Would you want to hear from me or would it be better just to find out from other people? She was having a hard time with all relationships at the time and I dont believe at least then she hated me. I think she still loved me. I dont want to do it in such a way that would feel weird and manipulative I want to give her something tangible that if she feels anything at all at this point or some point in the future will let her feel some kind of closure or at least that she wasnt abandoned. She doesnt know how bad its been or that its degenerating. How do I say it?,Bipolar

I live in the UK with free healthcare and all that jazz problem is I'm supposed to get repeat prescriptions weekly to my local pharmacy and they just don't arrive. Most weeks I have to phone the surgery to chase them up and now I'm essentially going cold turkey from lamotrigene sertraline and also meds for thyroid. It usually takes 2448 hours for a prescription to be ready to pick up if they actually remember to do it. My bf is putting in an official complaint tomorrow but not sure if it'll do anything.

I've been taking Latuda for about two weeks now first week at 40 then upped to 60. 40 seemed okay but 60 made me throw up the meds so my psych changed me to 20mg in the morning and 40 mg in the evening. I feel absolutely horrible. After taking the meds I feel this excrutiating restlessness like a constant surge of electricity running through my brain. Nothing helps. I can't focus on anything. It's so bad that when I feel it coming on I take antihistamines to slow my brain down and sleep it off.

45522,Rant I KNEW IT! My medication is poisoning me! I originally posted this over in the rCasualConversation Weekly Chat Thread but upon reflection realized it would be much better suited to this sub as it's pretty specific towards my disorder and I feel I'd get better advice here from people who are knowledgable of what I've been dealing with. From my original postgtIt'll be 8 years this summer since I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and got put on a treatment consisting of DepakoteEpilum sodium valporate for rapid cycling moods and mania. Over the years I've constantly inquired about what sort of side effects I would experience on this drug and every single time my doctors have been frustratingly vague and flippant never sitting down and going through the effects in a thorough and detailed manner.gtAs a result I've had to do my own research and recently I uncovered several side effects that NO ONE told me aboutgtAccording to what I've read in numerous articles and medical journals prolongedlong term usage of sodium valporate can apparently CAUSE depressive episodes and according to the many medical journals I've perused it is not as effective against treating depressive bipolar episodes in the long run. Considering that I've been dealing with crippling bouts of depression over the last 7 years this makes sense but noone told me. NO ONE TOLD ME.gtIt can cause pancreatic damage and liver problems on it's own. My pyschiatric doctor the one who typically prescribes me this shit on a 3 monthly basis has been constantly drilling it into me that all the times I've gotten elevated liver enzyme readings from my 68 weekly blood tests has been because I drank alcohol whilst taking this fucking medication. Not once has she ever stopped to inform me that this stuff causes liver problems all by itself regardless of whether you drink or not let alone any mention of trouble involving the pancreas which is typically characterized by intense crampingpain in the abdomen due to organ damage and inflammation of the pancreas. This makes SO MUCH SENSE considering that all these years I've had neardaily cramping and aches in my abdomen that I always previously thought was due to IBS or my IUD being a dick.gtApparently it can increase the likelihood of polycystic ovary syndrome and something called hyperandrogenism which I have never heard of before now but is a condition to do with having too many androgens or male hormonestestosterone in the body along with uterine fibroids which also explains the agonizing cramps I often get regardless of what time of the month it is. Also I was at childbearing age 22 when they first started me on sodium valporate and whilst I have no desire to ever procreate the fact of the matter is that all these conditions lead to infertility so I feel incredibly deceived by the doctors who put me on this shit because again NOONE TOLD ME ANY OF THIS.gtI am absolutely steaming and yet I just know that ifwhen I raise these issues with my current psych doctor she will no doubt laugh off my concerns like she always fucking does and dismiss my worries as trivial.gtI know it's dangerous to quit cold turkey but I honestly feel so betrayed right now considering all that I've learned. I ended up writing a strongly worded but teethgrittingly polite letter outlining all these concerns so I can slap her in the face with it not literally but y'know and get my voice heard.gtI want to change my doctor and try to get one who will help me find an alternative course of treatment but giving that all this happened on public healthcare which is often laughably crap at times here it wouldn't surprise me if it ends up being a long drawn out process.gtUrgh. I'm so angry I could spit fire!,Bipolar
46068,I'm not sure if I should go to the hospital Sorry in advance if this is kind of disjointed I admit I'm kind of having a hard time stringing a coherent sentence together right now. I'm trying to determine if I should go ahead and go to the hospital or wait until my psychiatrist appointment on the 19th. When I went on the last day of February they RX'd 25mg of Seroquel. I felt it was kind of low considering I was reporting hearing noises that weren't there children laughing lots of random noises turning to see things and they aren't there. My psychiatrist said maybe I was misinterpreting geese or other random noises but geese don't sound like young kids laughing imho. I'm mostly not wantingable to leave the house becaue I frequently feel like I'm being watchedpeople are video taping me outside. Since then I've also had two major episodes of dissociation that felt very extreme. I feel very anxious when I go places because I feel like I'm being watched but she said maybe it's just anxiety. I feel horrible most days and I can't sleep a lot of the time one night I got 3 hours. Today I actually feel much better still awful but in comparison it feels so much less worse. I don't feel suicidal but I'm at a loss for not being able to leave the house for months. I can't live forever like this and if it's 60 days between appointments and they give me medicine that wont' work every time I dunno what to do.I'm just not sure about the hospital I feel like I'm being dramatic and I'm not sick enough. Like today I don't feel as bad as I did Saturday so what if I'm getting better? even though I'm 90 not,Bipolar

50370,Slipping Into A Classic Depression Very Weird For Me. So it's been years like 15 years since I've had a depression that was not a mixed episode. I'd been pretty stable tye past 3 years but my migraines at least that's what my doctor thinks they wre had them for years have been getting worse. Last year I wound up in the ER with one so bad that I went from moving under my own steam to get in the door with the worst pain in my life made running over my foot with a one story tall steel gate feel like kiddy play to needing help into a wheel chair cause I couldn't even stand. I've had 3 rounds of blood work all normal a CT scan and MRI normal. Now an oximetry test Tuesday night. Waiting on doctor to interpret the results and an appointment with a neurologist august 9th soonest they had and required taking a personal day off work cause it won't fit well in my work day. They've never actually gone away. Even on days I don't record as having one I lowkey always have pain just it's at a threshold tolerable enough I can for tye most part ignore it. But most days of the week I've got headache andor the front of my brain feels like it's being prickled with pins and needles not in pain those thats reserved for my temples and the icepicks behind my eyes it makes my brain mush and makes me feel physically weak. But every appointment I have because of that they test for a stroke but I come out normalno stroke. And my mind is mush it can't think it's way out of a wet paper bag full of holes heck it will even struggle for forum words.I just feel so hopeless and empty and broken. Like a pathetic worthless loser and failure at everything. That I'm not worth shit. And between tye two I'm always exhausted and don't have the energy or will to do things and even when I force myself I feel like I'm shit at it. But I'm also super irritable and pissy and angry alot. So much of the time I could scream and shout but cry and beat myself in the head at the same time. I struggling very hard to use my logic and tools to get out from under all this.,Bipolar

So I've been to a lawyer who stated that because I have nothing and make so little I am judgement proof can be sued but to no avail.

45533,Meds or anxiety?? SOS Hi friends. Ive been experiencing muscle tension and spazzing in my legs that shoots throughout my whole body over and over again. It gets stronger as the attack goes on for sometimes hours and then just disappears out of no where. Im wondering if anyone else has experienced this and what it may be from? Im prescribed Latuda benztropine trazodone and propanoral spelling may not be right in some of those Please help! These attacks make me feel like I could murder myself and everyone around me. They make me feel like theres no reason to live like this. Im not sure if the episodes are anxiety inflicted or a horrible side effect from the meds. ,Bipolar
46032,Lurker realizing I need some help copingunderstanding depressive episode relapse. I guess for some preface I was diagnosed last year but have had it all my life. I'm type 1 but was pretty functional as I typically used what I now realize is my mania in school and etc. and pretty much was excelling despite going through manic and depressive episodes thinking it was normalteenage angst etc. until about my 4th year in college when things went down south fast. Fast forward two years a couple of hospital visits and finally getting a full wrap around team I'm a lot more stable now that I'm on what I feel are the right set of meds for me atm been on a set of lithium lorazepram and buproprion for the past 3 months and it's worked amazingly. It's allowed me to work write and just generally focus like I used to without the mood swings and recognize when I'm becoming manic or depressed at high caliber level that I'm used to. I know that the meds aren't a cure all and that relapse happens but recently have had a string of events good bad and otherwise have caused my depression to come back in full swing. I recognize it for what it is and why I feel like this which is a huge step compared to before but it's just as heavy and still rather difficult to deal with unlike my mania where I know just to tune it down. I don't really know what I'm looking for in this as i have a pretty solid support system but I guess if anyone else has had relapse experiences post medication I think hearing about others dealt with hearing about it would be helpful. Because I'm really in a spot where Im really not sure how to approach it and could probably use some netflixmovie suggestions as I don't have much energy to do anything else. Thanks for reading and sorry if this is all over the place. ,Bipolar
49966,Caffeine!? I am 26 F who has been recently diagnosed with BD. I am figuring out how am I with it what are my triggers ways to cope and live with it. I have noticed that when I am agitated low on concentration and focus coffee puts me back on track. Of course it triggers anxiety that's a down side but the boost that it gives to my thinking ability is something. I cannot stop talking about my ideas my thoughts and views on things after it. This post is a result of it tooNow my question is since I am new to all this. Is feeling like this okay or coffee triggers my mania and I should completely stop having it. Ps I have read on the internet that caffeine is bad for people who have BD.,Bipolar
45787,I had a rare win today. Ive been considering getting a new car for a while and recently I have been more and more obsessed and interested in it even though its really not an immediate need. I was bored and had an abnormal amount of free time today and im trending towards manic so I found myself driving to the dealership just look at this one I really liked. I had a plan. I told the sales guy straight up when I got there this is what Ill pay Im not paying any money today other than a straight trade and increasing my payment. Okay cool we have an understanding. So I drive the car its exactly what I thought it was and I really liked it. We go inside. I let him run my credit and talking about numbers. He comes back WAY more than what we already talked about and wanting a bunch of money down. I was clear It was too much but I still let him run back and forth to try something and see what we can do and I even started agreeing to pass my boundaries and give them a down payment which would have really hurt our savings and put us in a bad financial situation. I called my dad and I called my husband and basically had them talking me off a ledge because I told myself a thousand times like a mantra if it isnt the right deal Im not doing it. After 3 hours of then trying hard to pressure me I just told them I am leaving right now give me my keys. I was shaking and so uncomfortable and Im still surprised I got out of there without fucking myself financially.,Bipolar
49463,food as the main coping mechanism I eat a lot more after I started my meds. When I am stressed or under pressure I have a big appetite for food like sweets. I eat even more when manic even tho I am not hungry. I think I do it cause I have control over it but I see now how out of control it has gotten. I gained like 40 kg in 1 year and I am so unhappy with myself. I wish I could loos them kg over night. But the appetite never gets away and I eat again. It is vicious circle.,Bipolar

45773,Recently diagnosed with 2 not sure what this means I've kind of known I was bipolar or had some underlying issue since my mother was bipolar and I tend to have reactions like her. But I don't really know the difference between one and two or what bipolar really is. I was always diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I thought that I had depersonalization along with it and it was just not an issue to the psychiatrist.I guess my questions are what is bipolar disorder? Does this include depersonalization? Does this mean that emotions are all over the place and sporadic?I am currently on Lamotrigine and Zoloft any good experiences with that? Hoping it takes affect soon since I've been really manic and depressed at the same time.,Bipolar

46766,Delusion or just incredibly elevated anxiety? Hi everybody. Last year I was diagnosed as type 2 because I havent experienced what I considered to be full blown maniaonly hypo and Im extremely prone to severe depressed lows. However Ive been wondering a lot lately whether or not Im just experiencing an intense level of anxietyinsecurity or if this crosses into the area of what would be considered a delusion. I havent had any of the more obvious signs of delusions that Ive read about on here i.e. thinking Im God or somebody else or an informant etc. but I most definitely feel all the time like I can tell 95100 exactly what people are thinking about me to the point that it hinders me from functioning in many instances. For example I will literally coup myself up in my room for daysweeks because I feel like I absolutely know exactly what my roommates or friendsfamilyprofessors are thinking of me in these high and low emotional states and I dont want to even confront them for this reason. Ive even accused my mom of basically thinking her thoughts too loud at me or even lashing out when I think shes judging me or thinking something extremely negative. Shell obviously say things like Im assuming way too much and I have no clue what Im talking about and I still dont believe her. I know logically when I think about this that its ridiculous but part of me also lets it affect me to the point that I will hide myself or freak out about it. The fact that Im partially able to understand that this obviously isnt the true case is what dissuades me from calling it a delusion but its also so strong of a fear and observation that it makes me wonder. What do you think? Has anybody else experienced anything this? ,Bipolar

I just started taking 50mg of Lamotrigine and I was told it could cause my birth control to be ineffective and vice versa that the lamotrigine could be less effective bc of the birth control. Do you take lamotrigine and have you found a birth control that is effective together? Or did you have to stop taking it?

46898,I need energy! So back in September I finally came out of a multiyear depression and since then Ive been getting CBT which has helped so much. But Im still dealing with daily fatigue. I have a fairly light schoolwork schedule right now and it still tires me out. I feel like Im really being held back by it and worried I wont be able to go away to grad school. Im exhausted from the moment I get up in the morning and Im finding it really hard to sit down and write. Its mental as well as physical fatigue hard to focus my brain on anything. I miss feeling sharp.Im dxd BP2 BPD OCD tendencies but I havent experienced true hypomania in a very long timeIm more prone to mixed episodesirritability. I do experience occasional psychotic episodes paranoia delusions that make my brain feel like it's been electrocuted and often leaves me hungover but these in addition to most of my self harm urges seem to be a result of the BPD as opposed to the Bipolar. Ive been on lamotrigine 225 mg since 20122013 went on bupropion Wellbutrin almost 2 years ago 200 mg. The bupro I went on to try to bring myself out of depression it worked a bit and I tolerate it but nothing miraculous.Now that Im not in a depression though and Im still so tired Im wondering what else to do. My doctor ran a bunch of bloodwork and my iron was kinda low but taking iron supplements hasnt fixed anything. I even tried taking Cytomel despite hypo end of normal thyroid testing but it made me very ragey and I had to stop. My Drs temp suggested that maybe its the lamotrigine causing fatigue which is interesting and I might try bringing it down a titch but a couple years ago I lowered it a bit under supervision and my selfharm urges went up. But I also want to try lowering it a bit for brain fog reasons i.e. it gives me brain fog.So! While thats something I can try Im also wondering about energizing adjuncts. Wellbutrin is not giving me energy or if it is Id hate to see how I am without itnor is it raising my libido or suppressing my cravings it just seems to have given me tinnitus but Im still worried about going off it because this is still the most stablenondepressed Ive been in years. Tbh at the end of last semester I turned to energy drinks in desperation andthey dont make me manic? Sometimes I barely feel them. Still those are obviously not great to be using. So Ive been looking into modafinilarmodafinil and Vyvanse I imagine I would stay on lamotrigine because I overall tolerate it and it seems to be doing something Sorry this is rambly and yes Ive used search for past threads buttldr Any thoughts on adding modafinilarmodafinil or Vyvanse to lamotrigine? Any other ideas on ways to gain energy? Is this the lamotrigine? The bipolar itself? Something else??Thanks all!!,Bipolar
49541,Why does my brain know when to be depressedmanic? Why does my brain know when to be depressedmanic? Typically I cycle over the course of a few days at most but my psych increased my lamictal so I stopped getting depressed as often and don't really have mood issues unless I get stressed or take caffeine or something. I've been burning the candle on both ends recently and I have had frequent and almost constant but relatively mild bursts of energy with only mild dips into normal or depression. But I decided to actually get some sleep for once and now the depressive ends are hitting me really hard and the high ends are just me being normal instead of energetic. Usually I cycle over the course of a day and I am wondering how my brain can remember that so many manic bursts happened last week. Like is there some part of the brain that counts all my episodes and tells the other parts to be depressed? I guess I'm looking for a more brain psychology answer not like an analysis of my behavior or anything.,Bipolar

50477,Do your episodes result in physical health problems? I've been battling bipolar for about about 8 years and just recently diagnosed and medicated in the past year and a half. Every episode I have results in my thyroid swelling up as a reaction to stress like so big the endocrinologist gasped when he saw it I have a whole bunch of nodules on my thyroid and now instead of the thyroid swelling up it's the nodules that are filling with fluid and swelling up....only when I'm at the end of an episode so I know it's due to stress and the endocrinologist agrees. I've also experienced SIBO and I still do if I don't follow a strict diet I became allergic to fragrance coconut on skin and Aloe Vera all out of nowhere and my hair was falling out this all happened when I was unmedicated undiagnosed and extremely stressed out and my anxiety was through the roof.

45891,Did xanthan gum make me go manic? Confused.... Can anyone relate to this? I was on a really strict diet off dairy gluten not eating anything processed and feeling pretty stable. I was even sleeping well.Then someone brought me a treat these gluten free cookies and chocolate soy milk. I ate the cookies and as time progressed started to feel more unstable. Like unpleasantly stimulated unfocused bloated and I was up all night with insomnia and strange sensations going on in my body. I then read the ingredients on the cookies and it contained xanthan gum and tapioca starch and I decided to be cautious about those ingredients and didn't have any more cookies. I didn't however read the ingredients on the chocolate soy milk which turned out to also have xanthan gum. I kept drinking this for three days and my insomnia became steadily more severe and I started having to rely on sedatives again to sleep. My mood was also elevating and it became harder to focus on anything. I was feeling insanely promiscuous S Then by day four my anxiety and panic skyrocketed. I ended up getting SO desperate feeling hyper social and feeling so needy and vulnerable and afraid that it made me reckless making dangerous plans needing to meet up with any man or else I was convinced I'd die. I NEEDED someone to hold me OR ELSE.... Almost got myself in some trouble and was NOT thinking at all. Thankfully I managed to stay in the house and not act mostly because my family came back early and I could no longer have any strange men from the internet over........Anyway since I stopped drinking that chocolate milk I still have anxiety but am finally feeling a bit... more settled...... I'm back to being my introverted self again and not wanting to socialize at all and am just thankful that nothing really bad happened. I'm just confused about WHY that happened to me. Also during that whole time I was horribly bloated.Can anyone relate to anything like this?I'm confused and feel alone in this. And this isn't something anyone else really understands.If you read the comments here you'll find a lot of people have had puzzling reactions to this ingredient and insomnia is a common responsehttpschriskresser.comharmfulorharmlessxanthangum,Bipolar

I've been so stable for the past 2 years thanks to regimented medication therapy that I'm getting this idea in my head that I'm not bipolar or don't have any problems anymore. I realize this is dangerous thinking. Has this happened to anyone else? When I worked at a mental hospital a lot of older people came in not having had an episode in 10 years and then having it hit them all at once for whatever reason.

That's probably not good? The feelingthought fades and doesn't worry me. I'm not getting manic about it. Like I don't gaf that it happened. Whatever. I believe she's real. I'm taking my meds. So I'm confused as to why that would happen.Nothing else weird had happened. I was with my husband all day and he didn't notice anything strange.

46951,Lamictal making me hypomanic I've been taking lamictal for bipolar depression and it's working great in that aspect but I can't sleep now. I have night sweats and I can't stay asleep for more than 2 hours at a time at most. After awakening from about 5 to 6 hours of disturbed sleep I still feel amazing and energized. And in addition to that I have a slightly raised anxiety level which leaves me randomly sweaty all over sometimes during the day. Would Tegretol lithium or gabapentin be a good medication to mention to my psych when I visit them next? I mean I'm just fishing for options because I don't want to take APs but I still obviously need something for the manic side of things. I should mention I have a similar experience on anti depressants because they make me unable to sleep without pills so I'm starting to think I will need something for mania and depression.,Bipolar

49622,Anxiety and fear suddenly gone Long story short after a very difficult few months and then the death of a friend I am not doing well. My therapist is asking that I seek a higher level of care which I am pursuing hoping for an IOP group spot to open up soon. I do know the ER is there if things get too serious before then but Im trying to avoid that if possible.I think I can finally admit that a lot of my thoughts lately are suicidal. Not sure why I couldnt say that for so long but the fog has lifted enough that its become clear. I havent felt this sick in nearly 10 years since before my bipolar II diagnosis. I have no intention of acting on those thoughts but they are there nearly constantly. But the weird thing is my anxiety suddenly disappeared recently. I dont feel normal or free from anxiety almost like the anxiety left and was replaced by a strange calm apathy. I no longer fear death and I havent noticed myself feeling nervous about anything. It feels almost like when the anxiety left it almost gave the suicidal thoughts permission to be there. Im not scared anymore. Its been a weird feeling and I guess Im curious if anyone else has felt something like this? It feels confusing and I think Im trying to make sense of it.,Bipolar
46463,Mental health road to recovery. Fuck. Me. Im new to reddit. My sisters been an active user for years. I finally decided to check it out. Little overwhelming with all the communities. I feel like I want to reach them all.Anyhow going through a mental health transition. Seeking help Ive felt that I needed for a long time now. I could only repress myself for so long. This last melt down completely broke me. My life that I created is in my eyes perfect. Ive worked so hard to have it all to not be my mom. And yet here I am in the shower tears blending with the water and my dog is scratching at the door to get in. But in that moment I wanted everything to stop. Even my heart. I pulled myself out of the shower. Looked in the mirror. Wiped my eyes and smiled. I couldnt convince myself I was ok but maybe I could to my husband. Got dressed went downstairs. Tried folding some laundry. Tried hiding. Tried holding back. But I looked at him and completely lost it. Immediately I made an appointment with my primary that week. From there I have now sought out a therapist and psychiatrist. Ive since tried new medications. Not to much help. How am I supposed to feel? Bipolar 2 is my official diagnosis. However I always mask and mask and mask and pretend. Im very high functioning. Before my meltdown I was the most manic Ive ever been. Reckless. Hyper sexual my husband loved that part. No sleep. Busy busy busy. What can I get into next? Whats going to keep me from crashing? Constantly on the go. And the second I withdraw in the slightest people are surprised. What do you mean you dont want to go out? You dont want to talk and socialize? Why are you being so anxious? BECAUSE THIS IS WHO I AM. Ive been so fucking good at keeping this up I trick myself. But only for so long. Other people I had convinced. Which brings me here. Im now trying another medication AND was told that marijuana isnt a great match for bipolar which is a fucking bummer. I love my maryjane. However I am dedicated and took my vows seriously. I want to be the best me wife daughter sister and friend I can be. This process is hard and challenging. I want to be open with those around me about this struggle. But for now I think I need to understand it myself before the outside world can get it. Well thanks for sticking around this long if your still reading. This journey is hard but worth it. Exhausting but rewarding. Everyone keep your head up. Its so fucking hard. But please do it for yourself. Youll make it through. Were all struggling together in different ways but we all have the same end goal. Keep fighting. ,Bipolar
49631,imposter syndrome sucks this sucks. i feel like a stranger. it feels like everyone has stronger or more intense symptoms than i do. my therapist keeps telling me that labels arent everything and that she treats the individual not the diagnosis. it made me feel like crap when she said that. like the diagnosis the name the labels i always chased to get that sense of validation were all meaningless. and now i keep thinking that something is wrong with me. but maybe its not BP2? my psychiatrist is tapering me off lexapro and will be adding lamotrigine soon. i am week 5 on wellbutrin. she wouldnt be doing this is there wasnt something actually on the bipolar spectrum right?,Bipolar
45654,Latuda and akathisia My Latuda got up to 120 mg a few days ago and I'm suffering from terrible agitation and I can't stop moving my feet up and down. Is this akathisia? And will this side effect go away or do I have to treat it with propranolol or something?,Bipolar
45592,Medication adjustments I'm frustrated . 22F Bipolar 2. I need a rant . I'm in college. I struggled with schooling my entire life I guess for the simple fact that things don't hold my attention or interests for long. Pair that with depression and random hypomania anxiety and well... nothing good. I dropped out of hignschool but got my vrade 12 and now I'm trying to better myself . While I'm doing better than before due to medication it's still a struggle. Back in February 2017 I made the hard choice to see my doctor and have a referal put in to see a psychiatrist . Since I live in a shitty area we have one fly in once every so often. So when I seen him he put me on lamotragine and said that was the issue at hand to be dealt with first then we would see what the next point of action would be ADHD depression anxiety. Since I've been doing well with anxiety he suspected ADHD would be next and seemed to think I would be able to notice after the dose was increased a few times. Fast forward to today. I'm on 150mg of lamotragine clonazepam as needed when I get aggressive panic attacks etc. I was leveled out for months at 125mgs but had a checkup for refills back in October where my family doctor increased them because the psychiatrist wanted to see about getting me up to 300mgs. Since it was what the psychiatrist wanted family doctor wanted to keep increasing to see what the differance is... I was hesitant because I'm in school I don't want to jeopardize anything and this dosage I was on was tried and true as far as I was concerned. After telling him how I felt he said your feeling good now maybe you could be feeling better so... benefit of the doubt I did as I was told. Yesterday I had another appointment. I went in figuring it was the usual routine. Told him I couldn't concentrate I was feeling distracted often and easily and my interests were shifting pretty often so I was concerned. I asked to see the psychiatrist again to talk about ADHD since that's what was suggested before and seems to be what I'm dealing with. I was told WE DONT HAVE ONE RIGHT NOW.... BUT would very soon and I would have a referral put in to see himher for when we do and they visit. Awesome right? So now he wants to lower my dosage back to 125mgs to see the difference which is the same shit I was told when he increased it to 150mgs. I don't want to do that. I'm uncomfortable possibly distressed about the thought of it altogether since I'm so sensitive to these things. I can't afford a hypomanicdepressive spiral right now not while I'm in school... so I'm thinking I'll just keep my dosage until I see another psychiatrist.... FML,Bipolar
50404,Reading too much in to signs? Hey all. The last few days have been really rough so Im chalking all of this up to just exhausted bipolar brain in overdrive but I need some advicehelp here. For the last few months Ive been seeing 222 pop up EVERYWHERE. Busses signs takeout orders etc. Id been telling myself that it was just regular old pattern recognition up until the last few days. Yesterday on 32223 my mother passed at 222am. Obviously this has just sent me in to a massive spiral of it was a sign and I was hoping others who have experienced similar phenomenathinking has any advice or insight on what this might mean or what I can do to get through this. Any and all advice is welcome and appreciated.,Bipolar
50017,What country are you in and what treatment are you receiving? I'm curious about how doctors in different countries approach bipolar treatment. I'm in the US and I'm taking 200 mg of Lamotrigine daily. My psychiatrist recommended talk therapy but I declined due to cost. He also prescribed Adderall but I couldn't tolerate it due to insomnia.I sometimes do CBT workbooks and I'm in a DBT Skills Training group. These were never recommended by a doctor but I think they help.Edit Adderall was prescribed for my ADHD diagnosis. I was also diagnosed with an Anxiety Disorder with generalized anxiety and obsessive compulsive features but I was never prescribed a medication for this condition.,Bipolar
45601,Acceptance...for now. I've been on disability for a good while now. Anyone on disability can probably relate to the strong desire to be away from it. The Social Security office generally treats you like a criminal you never know who agrees with the negative stigma and sees you as some sort of lazy leach on society and some days you fight with the notion yourself. Many people tie worth to one's ability to work and contribute and it's easy to fall into that realm of thought where you feel worthless and ashamed. Anyway to my story. Around June last year I was put on a gamechanging medication. My anxiety disappeared seemingly overnight and I felt more confident and comfortable than I have for most of my life. Gears started turning in my head. I could go out among the people! Maybe I could find some companionship and stop feeling so lonely. Maybe I could earn my keep and feel some pride for a change.This lead to me starting a second parttime job with the intention of ramping up my hours carefully and slowly the goal being to eventually be making enough to support myself without the SSDI check Medicare etc. I was certain I was on track to being an honest normal person. I took on more and more responsibilities. Things were looking good for about 6 months.Then the medication turned on me as it seems they all eventually do. Every day things get worse. While it still keeps the majority of my anxiety at bay I now have a persistent depression. I've lost interest in many things including wanting to do a good job at work. I let things slip do the bare minimum and count each second until I am able to go home. Increasing hours at a job that I am having less and less of a tolerance for seems like a good way to speed up an inevitable crash and burn. If something doesn't change soon I will likely have a breakdown andor wind up in the hospital.And for what?Before I started the new med and took the second parttime job I was doing okay for myself. My first part time job was enough to keep me connected to the outside world even though the pay might have been considered token at best. I kept myself busy with personal projects. At times I felt lonely but I had friends. I had trouble with anxiety and depression but I had time and space to cope. In my current situation I feel like I'm on a speeding train. There are no timeouts when I am feeling terrible. What time I have for my own interests is tainted by dread of the next workday and this consistent low current of depression. The second parttime job has made the first one the one I found rewarding and enjoyable feel like an inescapable chore. All I want to do now is go home and hide. All this effort put in to build a respectable life and dig myself out from under disability and I feel so much more frightened fragile and trapped than before. No medication has been effective for me for such a long duration. I was certain it was the one so I ended up biting off more than I could chew. Now I'm dependent on a drug that makes me miserable and puts me in a precarious emotional state every day. I stress out and hide from my responsibilities. Every day I feel inadequate and not up to snuff. And why? Because I felt guilty for being on disability? Because I was certain that life free off it would be better? That I couldn't have companionship selfworth or be among the living if I wasn't earning my keep in traditional terms?After much thought I have made a conscious choice to regress. Clearly working full time is not an attainable goal for me right now. I'm cutting my current average of 15 hours per week at my second job to around 7. Between it and my first job I'm likely looking at around 10 a week which I think will be manageable. Also I'm getting off the wonder drug that keeps my anxiety at bay at the cost of my sanity and happiness. I will regroup stabilize and find some damned peace.Being off disability wasn't in the cards this time and that's okay. There's a reason I was put on it in the first place. Maybe I will find an opportunity to be financially independent in the future maybe not. But I will stop with the selfshaming. I can still have a worthwhile life whatever the circumstances. TLDR I found a wonder drug thought it would finally get me off disability. It didn't and that's okay. Life goes on.EDIT Added TLDR and fixed some grammar.,Bipolar
46161,There's no amount of meds I can take that will properly medicate my overwhelming generalized anxiety without screwing everything else up It just feels cosmically unfair that the fact that I need to take multiple mood stabilizers seems to mean the balance is such that it's impossible for SSRIs to lessen very much of my anxiety. I've been seeing my pdoc for years and she's great and I trust her and we spent two years figuring out the formula for my comorbid cocktail. Before I was diagnosed bipolar obvs life was miserable but I was able to take a higher dosage of the SSRI I still take Lexapro and maybe I'm remembering with rose colored shades but I feel like back then while my life may have been spiraling out of control the anxiety wasn't quite so paralyzing. We've tried multiple times to increase the Lexapro but every time I become catatonically emotionless within the week so I know at least for Lexapro that's not a viable option.My pdoc seems to think that the anxiety is more situational than chemical but I can't help but feel this isn't a normal or completely unmedicateable level of crippling anxiety to feel constantly. At the same time this isn't an ideal point in my life to go gambling with switching up my meds again. Is it really just impossible for some of us to find chemical relief from anxiety in a way that won't throw off the balance of the mood stabilizers? I know I should pursue DBT or CBT but makes that really difficult right now when I already pay my pdoc out of pocket and am broke as a joke. Is it pessimistic or deluded to think there's no way something other than medication could treat my anxiety the way meds did in the past? I know therapy could help with depression and such but what of the everysecondofeveryday anxiety that is definitely not entirely situational and has not improved with changing situational circumstances? If the anxiety was caused by something specific I might be more optimistic about CBTDBT but it's just... generalized. It doesn't go away.I feel my options are a. try another drug and start over so to speak or b. accept that this is my lot in life as a bipolar person.,Bipolar
46767,Doctor wants medication changes There's a long history with my psychiatric illnesses and medications but I'll jump ahead. 2 and a half years ago I got extreme PPD and was hospitalized twice. I was only on a small bit of klonopin at first but it stopped working. Everything I tried made me crazier until one doctor put me on Celexa. After initial anxiety it changed my life. Saw a regular psych who tried different things so I wouldn't get manic and I was hesitant. Had a huge drunken manic episode was hospitalized again and prescribed Abilify 10 and it helped a lot. That was almost a year ago.ampx200BI was doing okay taking sleeping pills at night stomach meds ativan propanolol. I needed birth control for PMDDRecently Psych took me off sleeping pills and ended propanolol I get severe anxiety an panic attacks. My Birth Control made my anxiety unbearable one week every month so my med doc switched me to something else and increased my stomach meds acid refluxgastritis. I started an anti inflammatory diet being tired of this mess and was exercising doing well and happy which my psych thought was hypomania although I was still depressed a lot. She wanted me to drop my dosage to 10 mg while remaining on 10mg Abilify. I am terribly med sensitive and many things cause crazy reactions for a long time. That is a big cut for me. So basically in one month new birth control also sensitive no sleep meds less anti anxiety meds more stomach problems and now a decrease in a med that I had no problem with. I'm two days in and already going crazy what can I expect?ampx200BLong story short Lots of med changes. On Abilify 10mg ativan twice a day Loe Estrin Fe and Dropping 20 mg Citalopram to 10 and feel a mess.,Bipolar
45752,Latuda WithdrawalsAkathisia Hi AllI was put on Latuda for about 3 weeks 1 at 10mg 2 at 20mg as my previous stabiliser wasn't doing much for me. I assumed my worsening depressionanxiety were withdrawals but by week 3 I ended with akathisia that has really fucked me up.Pdoc took me off it immediately and prescribed me 0.25mg Xanax to take as needed which I had been taking one or two of intermittently to cope with the transition It's been 12 days since my last Latuda dose but I'm still having major depressionpaniccrying fits and I'm concerned that the longer I take the Xanax the more reliant I'm going to become on it. I'm already taking between 1.252mgday and while I'm having more frequent periods of stability it's sometimes taking more Xanax to get there and boy do I come crashing down hard once that 5 hour mark passes.Has anyone had similar experiences coming off Latuda? I'd think that with only 3 weeks on I'd be in the clear by now but I've heard some horror stories and I'm also terrified of replacing one set of symptoms with another the longer I stay on Xanax.Thanks.,Bipolar

50366,Is getting bored with your job a trait of being Bipolar? I was diagnosed when I was 35. Im 39 now. I have had so many 3 months jobs in the last two years. I get bored very quickly and I feel like the work isnt challenging enough. I was recently diagnosed as ADHD and am medicated for that as well. It has still not helped. Ive been with my current job for 6 months. Im having the same problem. I get paid very well for what is expected of me but theres so much down time. Hence the boredom.

46310,Brother is still manic Flying across country MULTIPLE times with no ID A while ago I posted about brother 27M who was manic eventually we got him admitted into a hospital with a court order clinicians agreed he was manicpsychosisillusions of grandeur etc. He was recently released after 2 weeks court order 'dissolved' as he agreed to voluntary 30day residential treatment. No surprises when he checked himself out after one day of residential treatment... And has now flown himself with another credit card he secretly has to another state without ID.I'm surprised he has been able to get on a plane 4 times now without any ID and just a photocopy of his passportlast ID. Is it that easy to get past TSA? Not really sure what we can do at this point. He's been asking for his passport because he wants to leave the country and we have it locked in a safe.

50143,Easily set off I just want to start this off by saying that Im aware that I have a problem and I want to fix it. I am easily set off. I mean really easily. There are so many instances where I get set off by smalllighthearted comments. At times I have gone off on people for really small things and it has ruined relationships. This is while being relatively stable too. What I mean is this has been when Im not depressed or manic. Another thing Ive noticed is that if someone makes a comment that hurts my feelings it really hurts me. To the point where I become severely depressed and question why I should go on with life if I cant do xyz and people dont appreciate me. There have been 2 instances where friends havent responded to my messages right away and I explode. One of those instances was when I was manic. I have ruined those two friendships. Lately I have been really good about being able to recognize the feelings that Im having and sit with them instead of releasing all of those negative emotions. Do any of you experience these things too? Is this just a normal part of being bipolar? If you have experienced this what has helped you overcome these emotions?,Bipolar
50110,So frustrated with myself... I was just diagnosed as bipolar a few months ago even though for the last 10 years I've been telling them that I thought I was. I have manic episodes but they only last a couple days then I go straight back into depression. When I am depressed I completely withdraw from society and go into my shell. I won't answer the phone or texts and I avoid doing any tasks because of a complete lack of motivation and some sort of fear about dealing with things that might be unpleasant. I'm on short term disability from work for this and an autoimmune disease and I need to turn in papers by March 23rd from my doctor ir else they will not approve my claim. I've been laying here in bed for days not bathing and in this cycle of not doing the paperwork but then feeling guilty about it and its fucking miserable. I know that avoiding the paperwork is only causing me to make the anxiety and problem worse but even the thought of likely losing my job isn't enough to overcome the lack of motivation. I'm about to call my doctor and ask about a change of med dosage. I guess I just wanted to vent to someone that might understand what I'm going through.,Bipolar

49810,Hypomaniamania doubt Does anyone ever feel like their hypomania or mania isnt that bad when in reality it is? Im always questioning my diagnosis because I feel like my mania isnt even half as bad as some things I read. Or not even close to what is portrayed on tv shows or movies. Recently its been getting worse as Ive had strong urges to do really risky stuff. For example I had such an urge to climb up the stairs and stand and lean over the railing where a kid jumped off. And I was gonna do it to get rid of the feeling but then I was scared that I would continue to lean and lean until I got the urge to jump off. Same thing happened when I crossed a bridge except I did end up leaning into it. But before this episode my mania was only feeling really confident or believing I had superpowers or paranoia that everyone was looking at me and my irritation was really bad. Like I was screaming at my computer today. Just wanna know if anyone also thinks their not bipolar because their mania isnt even half as bad as they read some peoples experiences,Bipolar
45524,For the ladies out there Bipolar and that time of the month? some stats i'm 23 diagnosed with BP 1 with psychotic features Major depressive disorder severe panic disorder PTSD amp mild ADD when i was 21 but have been dealing with BP symptoms since i was around 14 or 15. i'm also extremely sensitive to almost everything. So i notice when its that time of the month or whatever i've pretty much always noticed this My moods get a bit dangerous. i'll be mostly stable the rest of the month but since i'm already a sensitive person when i'm on my period i feel like my moods go to the extremes really quick. right now i keep having random extremely angry thoughts. i don't have anything to be mad about. but i just feel almost uncontrollably angry. its like literally my brain goes to polar opposites and its frustrating. I've been dealing with extreme moods while on my period for a really long time. i'm just not sure if its me or if Bipolar has an effect? Does anyone know if BP amps up the mood swings or am i just a moody bitch? lol. I currently am not on any medication due to some insurance problems. but i do smoke weed regularly indica only and it helps a LOT. more than the pills in my opinion but i know i need meds just need to figure out this whole insurance thing.In the past i've been on MANY medications amp honestly none of them helped while it was that time of the month. Some of them made me worse more depressedtriggered Mania. I've been told Birth Control helps but i don't notice a difference. I asked my doctor and she says its very possible but i just want to know from people who have BP.Sorry if this is an inappropriate question I'm just curious really. Side note being an adult is an inconvenience can i make a new character and start over? lol. Also i notice i ramble a lot. my thoughts are always like this amp they never really make sense. its even worse when i talk irl amp i'm actually probably the most awkward thing on this planet. It's gotten a bit worse over the years amp i think my brain kinda has lagged out on me. idk. Sorry about that. anyways hope everyone has a wonderful day!!!,Bipolar

46094,I'm depressed Friend of mine who I valued a lot just cut all ties with me. Told me that Im too needy and emotional. Theyre not wrong. Im bipolar and I had a really fucked up childhood which caused a lot of abandonment issues something Im in therapy for now. It does make me very emotional at times and I do tend to be super clingy during depressive episodes. Lately Ive been rapid cycling which causes me to have more of them. They knew all this and I was hoping they would understand. But they told me that they dont want anything to do with me and never want to see me or talk to me again. Feels weird. Just this Monday my therapist told me that my fear of abandonment is just that a fear and I need to overcome it. Told me that I need to open new pathways in my brain and know that people wont leave me. This doesnt help with that at all.I started a new job this week and its mind numbingly boring and insanely hard. Im only on week one and I already hate it. Im dreading going to work today. But I need this job. It pays well and I have a decent amount of debt that I need to pay back.Because of my childhood I dont feel like I can ever trust my parents. Im not close to any of my family. After having so many friends walk out on me over the years I feel like I cant trust the friends who did stick with me. I feel like things just need to get a bit harder and theyll leave too.I havehad dreams about doing something in the entertainment field. But lately I dont feel any drive or motivation to chase after that. I dont see the point in it. I wanted fame and money because I thought I could give the people I love awesome things with it. But I dont really love anyone anymore. Im always paranoid and worried that everyone will leave me.I just feel so alone all the time. I feel like no one really understands me. I feel like I cant connect. Even with my therapist I cant really tell her how I feel. Because sometimes my thoughts are really fucked up and when I tell people they freak out on me. Medication doesnt help. I just hate waking up in the morning now. The only times I ever feel ok is when I drink or take something. I just really hate life right now. I wish there was a permanent way to just numb everything.,Bipolar

45687,Im new Im new to this subreddit but Im very grateful to be here ! Im 21 I got diagnosed as manic depression type 2 in October. Previously I was missed diagnosed with depression and general anxiety. Ive been on and off the same medication since I was 16. Its currently not working so Ive had to take a break again to try something new. Im currently coming out of this depression part of my cycle. Usually the hypomania comes next because Im so stressed out about how hard I fucked up whatever happened in the 34 weeks of depression. I struggle a lot with trying to cope self harm. I use to cut for almost two years when I was in high school which was be main reason I got on medication to begin with. Throughout the years 1621 Ive gone on a few binders. When I was younger it was MDMA amp alcohol when I became older it was alcohol. But was all stopped by the fact that I was pregnant. My kids have been the only reason why I havent slipped back into drugs or alcohol. Im currently in outpatient treatment I guess you would call it that. I go see two doctors to talk and sort out my feelings and try and find a program fitting for me. This has been the hardest fight of my life. I thought this was over but after I had my son it creeped right back for revenge. I had him in 2016 and Ive basically missed half of his life because I dont remember from being so depressed or my anxiety. Im in this place in my life now where I dont even know where I am at everyday waking up. I feel like I dont have a path anymore. Ive lost focus in my career right now Im trying to pull myself back into this but I cant. Im mentally so exhausted I just feel useless. I fight so hard everyday to keep myself alive and calm and then my two kids all alone. I choose to put myself here and I constantly wish I didnt. I wish I could have given them a better start or a better life currently. I have a job interview Wednesday on Valentines Day. This is the first job Ive gone to since October when I tried to kill myself. I left a job after one orientation because it was a trigger to me basically. I had to hold myself back from saying things or doing things to this crazy woman who I found out lied about having cancer. I hold hope for this job I hope this can change my routine into something healthy and I can actually enjoy going to work again. I miss life I miss being able to enjoy life I just miss me. ,Bipolar

50498,recently diagnosed amp very anxious when it comes to meds hey all.i was recently diagnosed. to sum up my dilemma my entire life anytime ive had a medical problem arise ive always been dismissed as it being anxiety. i have a history of unexplained syncope episodes amp wacky blood test results but no doctor has ever taken me seriously. perks of being a 22 year old female. ive been told to take antidepressants for viral illnesses amp the like. so ive grown costumed to having a distrust towards doctors or i feel like they just use me for money amp dont listen to me ya know?anyway thats not why im here. i hit rock bottom a few months ago amp have been seeing a wonderful therapist who truly advocates for me amp gives me a voice. he referred me to a psychologist amp we did the whole genesight thing. she wants me to start taking latuda.i did the whole googling the medicine thing amp asked some friends about it amp i have yet to see a good review. i also dont want to be even more tired than i am now as im exhausted 247 as is. amp im scared meds could impact work or school.i guess im just here asking for validation to ease my anxiety. will meds actually help me? or will i feel miserable? im really scared. im so hyper aware of my body amp i freak out about any minor change even headaches. but also as the months go on the more i feel wildly reckless amp isolated. if i start taking them amp want to get off them will they forever change me like antidepressants can? id rather enjoy my few months of mania no matter how wild it can be vs forever be different..i dont mean for any of this to seem invalidating or disrespectful by the way. its just my experiencesparanoia,Bipolar
46746,Don't Want a Life with Bipolar Trigger Warning I spend most of my time deeply depressed. Suicide attempts ideation self harm isolation and generally there is just a huge part of me that bullies myself. I've been in therapy for years been hospitalized tried every med out there and I excersize meditate and eat well. At best I am minimally functional. I can't handle stress relationships destroy me and I can't connect to anyone. This is not a life I am willing to live so now what? I can't keep doing this. Life is almost purely pain and suffering for me. It's torture. I can't have a day without extremely intrusive thoughts of mutilating myself and I have a million other health problems besides bipolar. On top of that my life is generally just a disaster and I can't afford food or a place to live. I hate who I am and I hate that after years of work I am no different. All I want is to be able to love others and be loved but I think I'm broken and unfixable. What do I do? Is suicide my only option? I can't do more meds and the hospital was traumatic. I can't go back there.,Bipolar
50178,Have to get out of depressive episode ASAP Been on a depressive episode for the last 23 weeks I usually cycle with the seasons.. was living in Canada for 10 years which made my depression on winter unbearable now I live Mexico and its way better. My episode are not as severe and I guess for a moment I took it for granted that my episodes were mild and I was stable for a good while. I work independently as an artist so if Im not in the studio theres no one I have ti answer to which in general I love. I love what I do and Im so grateful to be able to do it. Im at stage in my life where Im expanding my business and moving to a bigger studio space and its all great! But the the episode started creeping in and I cant afford to give into it Im getting all these anxieties and fears I know I can do this and have been fighting everyday but this week has been really hard. Im in the studio at the moment but havent been able to lift a finger. Trying all the skills and coping mechanisms I know help me plus my meds so really hope this ends soon. Letting all this out I think will help havent talked about it much with people as Ive found I focus more on the feeling but needed to vent.,Bipolar

46799,Going to see a new Dr. tmrw and hopefully hop back on the med wagon! This is very long and in no way asking for a DX. The whole reason im booking an appt with a qualified professional tmrw is so I am able to get Dxd. This is more of a vent post Can anyone tell me about their experiences with mania and the journey to a DX I guess. Anyways loooong post under this paragraph. Im on mobile so i apologize for any mistakes.I suspect i have bipolar. My friends suspect i have bipolar. When I first went to a therapist for devoloping issues after I made a very stressful move at 18 and was really struggling she was the first to suspect Bipolar and pushed me to to see a psych. She suspected bipolar due to very impulsive behaviors sexual and dangerous and hallucinations that happened while I smoked. Unfortunately I didnt see a psych for a long time.Who really knows but i would like for this at least to be considered bc i had a hell of a time last summer and im probably gearing up for another hell summer if i dont get something straight. I in no way am qualified to diagnose myself of course and this is mostly so I can get my facts straight to tell the doctor.Last summer starting around march my mood really picked up and i was having delusions paranoia psychosis all that good stuff. Maybe it was the weed maybe it was something else. I at one point believed the owner of someone i was dogsitting for was secretly filming me from a camera in her bed and her tv. I thought every police man was out to get me. I felt watched all the time. For a straight month I only ate stale kid sized bags of smart popcorn from my trunk and this was before i got kicked out of my house. I never slept more than 2 hours. I got kicked out of my house for smoking weed constanly even though i promised I wouldnt do it again. I drove like a manic In talking going 100 down I95N any baltimorians here?? yall hit essex and the highway gets all twisty the adrenaline rush was insane At the time was in the middle of a ED relapse and just didnt give a fuck I mean i was planning to buy a dog a car an apartment with absolutely no money. Shit me and the friend i was living with had elaborate plans to start a dog grooming business. I quit my job suddenly one night for no real reason and once spent an entire 7 hours filling out loans. In september I bought a car with a loan that hand a ridiculous interest rate and smashed it into a exit sign a week later bc my phone died and i was agitated and got bored I have no idea what this was but thank god im alive bc i totally smashed my car to bits. I was wearing my seatbelt and I joke im a walking seatbelt ad.At the time I had been on Lexapro for about two weeks after seeing a psych and expressing the issues that were going on which she said sounded like anxiety and depression. The doctors in the hospital told me it was anxiety and depression. Maybe it is. I would just like some answers. I was in the hospital for six weeks where they tried out Lexapro again and after I had adverse reactions extreme irrabilty impulsiveness they switched me to Prozac and Risperdol and Dxd me with BPD and let me go. My aunt had BPD but i also have a family history of undiagnosed disorders that caused extreme psychosis my grandfather used to hear voices and suffered mood swings but he was black and this was the 60s black people didnt go to the doctor for shit like that they either drank it away or went to church. When i got out i spent 1500 dollars i didnt have on random shit including three tattoos and completly fucked up my credit. I was medicated with a low dose of Prozac 20 mg and Risperdol .1mg at the time. Three weeks later i was so depressed i did nothing but sleep and not eat. I lost ten pounds. They admitted me to the hospital for my ED about a month after I got out of my first hospitalization for the car crash. The psych there said a BPD dx didnt make sense coming from someone who had only known me for abt four weeks and pulled it off my record. She put me on prozac and seroquel but didnt give me a bipolar dx just left it as historical. I was doing okay and moved in with my Aunt in Texas and had about two weeks where i went off the seroquel bc i couldnt get it refilled. I stopped sleeping again and was just generally euphoric. Nothing too crazy I was just very happy and excited and never sleeping and playing sims like a maniac. I stopped taking my seroquel after I got it refilled bc I didnt like the feeling of forced sleep. Stopped taking my prozac too cause i just dont give a fuck lol. Now ive been off my meds for about a month and a half and Ive been okay very impulsive and hyper sexual making questionable decisions quitting a new job I had for about a week becoming a Cam girl hopping on tinder but still sleeping. I wanna go back on my meds but I know that after being off seroquel this long I have to wean up to the dose I was on 300mgs cause theres no way I can just start at that high again. Anyways anyone else just experience wild ass shit before they got a DX?? Even if im not bipolar I really dont want a repeat of last summer lol.TLDR Im trying to go back on my meds and get a DX from a doctor. Had a wild ass summerfall last year and just generally did not have a good time. Anyone else have trouble with multiple DXs before they settled on one?,Bipolar
46337,Just casually sharing my lifestory I never share my genuine and real problems with anyone close to me and I just want to get some things off my chest.Disclaimer Don't be stupid and go off your medication in a single day without anybody watching it like I did. This could seriously harm you don't do it learn from my mistakes. Also try not to lie if that's a problem for you.ampx200BWhen I was 14 my mother first took me to a GP to ask for a referral to a children's psychiatrist. From there on it was a whirlwind of seeing different psychiatrists and receiving different diagnoses. 2 years later it was agreed that I had bipolar II and I was put on medication and sent to therapy. ampx200BI'm not sure how medication worked for me I was prescribed some moodstabilisers and I took them and after I was asked how they work for me I said yeah they are great despite not feeling any difference at all. Therapy didn't help me either I'm a selfdiagnosed compulsive liar and therapy did nothing for me because I just lied to my therapist about a bunch of trivial things so I never allowed her to get close. I think I lie mostly because I don't like people getting to know too much about me and my life though often I also just lie for no reason at all. I'm not a sociopath or psychopath I do experience emotions very much and sometimes I get angry at myself for lying to people I care about. ampx200BFor some reason at some point when I was 17 I just could not manage to call my psychiatrist nor my therapist for another appointment. My mother who is a supportive and kind person normally who however always stigmatised and made fun of me for mental health issues despite having some herself refused to call them for me on the basis that I'm 17 I should be able to do this for myself now.ampx200BSo I never went back to my psychiatrist and that meant no more pharmacy recipes for my medication. That's how I uncontrolledly went off my moodstabilisers. It was a whirlwind and it pushed me right back to the start of my problems. Don't do this. This is stupid and dangerous and not recommended by ANYBODY.ampx200BSince then I have learned to control myself better and I have learned coping methods that help me. I still know I am going through phases of depression and hypomania and rapidcycling. I am learning methods that help me push through it. I believe I'm at a point in my life where I have the will and drive to get help and medication again but I try to cope. I'm turning 21 soon and currently enrolled halftime at an online university. I study in English which is not my native language but I enjoy it very much and it's a field I am very very interested in. I have a boyfriend who is older than me and financially supports me. I am a supportive family that I could always come back to running if I dropped out of university it would not be the end of the world. Even though I dropped out of high school right before graduation because I stood no chance at ever passing the math final I could get a job and not worry about money thanks to my family's circumstances.ampx200BNow I mostly suffer from the 'side effect' symptoms of BP II as I like to call them delusions emotional intensity binging on various things and irritability. I sometimes get bouts of feelings of guilt for things that are long done with or just for no reason. I feel highly emotional about wasting food money other things. Which can be a challenge when you experience hypomania sometimes lol.ampx200BThank you for reading if you came this far I hope you're coping well. I'm not sure whether I ever told my story this honestly.,Bipolar
45999,Does anyone else have the urge to stop taking their meds? I struggle with the urge to stop taking my meds all the time. I'm tired of the weight gain and the side effects. The antipsychotics seem to have the worst side effects. But I know if I stop taking them I'll turn into a crazy bitch. Yet even on medication I still also struggle with impulsive sex with strangers. Does anyone also still experience impulsive actions even on medication? This is something that makes me feel quite ashamed and is not healthy. ,Bipolar
46929,5 years Today marks 5 years without being inpatient which is a huge achievement for me. I spent a lot of time inpatient as a young adult. I probably spent more time as an inpatient than out between 1719 years old and then in and out for years after that. I've had some close calls with manic episodes but I've managed to keep things from getting to the point where it's a crisis.I'm proud of myself! It also marks 5 years of keeping the same career choice which is another huge one for me. I used to flip flop and jump from job to job so much. I'm glad I was finally ablation to find something I enjoyed which probably helped keep my episodes from being as serious as before.You can do it! It's possible even if things seem bleak. 12 years ago I tried to kill myself and was ready to die and even though sometimes those feelings return I know it's just the bipolar and not me.,Bipolar
49660,Possibly losing parenting rights due to bipolar disorder The most recent manic episode I had was after being depressed and diagnosed with major depressive disorder to be prescribed Zoloft. Within 6 weeks I was staying up for 9 days and delusional. I thought my partner was going to kill me so I called 911. The police arrived and I was very agitated and explained my delusions and they took me to the nearest psych ward for an evaluation. Unfortunately that psych ward didnt keep me long enough despite my volunteering to stay longer. They also gave me a medication I ended up allergic to which took treatment even longer.This resulted in asking my inlaws who live in a different state miles away to help me care for my daughter until I found the right medication combination and was stable. I knew it could take a few months and I had no one else available local to me. The only way my inlaws would take my daughter is if I signed over guardianship. I was under the impression it would only be for a year at the most. But honestly I wasnt really in the right mind to consent to that paperwork. I just knew I needed help and I did what I could to ensure my daughter had the best care possible while I got stable. Fast forward to now my partner and I petitioned the courts to end guardianship as I have been stable for 2 years. I have letters from my therapist and pdoc stating I am in treatment and stable and medication compliant. Well my inlaws are trying to prove I am unfit for things I did while I was manic so they can adopt my daughter without my consent or permission through the courts. They're also trying to prove that my partner their child is unfit I am less worried about that. My therapist says they're on a witch hunt and that they're just trying to raddle me and no judge would grant them adoption. I hope she's right. I just wanted to share what I am going through because 1. support would be nice. and 2. if anyone else is going through this you aren't alone.,Bipolar
50301,Brain FogMemory Loss First time poster still trying to figure out Reddit. My friend recommended this app once I got my diagnosis of Bipolar 2 last year. Im 29 diagnosed at 28. Ever since my psychiatrist diagnosed me with Bipolar Disorder I have been suffering from serious short term memory loss. Ive never had the most attentive brain but before I started taking my medicationhad someone to talk to I remembered things too well if that makes sense. For example my fianc and I were talking last night and I pulled out my calculator and typed one number in and then all of a sudden I couldnt remember what we were talking about 2 minutes prior. Then I asked what we were talking about and he gave me the most concerned look. I know he isnt mad at me but worried. Its happening so often Ive started writing everything down. Like everything conversations tasks reminders messages I need to reply back to. Its getting ridiculous. Im currently taking Busprion 15 mg 3x a day Hydroxyzine 50 mg 3x a day Aripiprazole 10 mg 1x a day and Buspar 150 mg 1x a day. Also I work a very high stress job. I am a program coordinator for a low barrier homeless shelter. We deal with death ODs fights assault of staff rape allegations. Its rough. Maybe this info will help? Idk.

46578,I am spiraling. Yesterday my panic attack lasted basically all day and today I've been waking up crying. Like the title says I feel like I'm losing the battle again. I'm on Lamictal but this weekend something triggered me and I've been failing to cope. Someone who I thought was my friend invited me to hang out and I had to drive quite a bit so it wasn't like a spur of the moment thing. Then my friend ditched me to hang out with someone else and left me with his friends who I had just met that night. I left in the morning I was staying over and they never came back. I did something kind of petty to get back at them and when I called to apologize they said they owed me a call but were out with their friend X right now so that made me feel even more like shit because apparently it's ok to ditch me but not step out for a phone call. I really cared about this person and it just sucks to be treated like I'm disposable. Normal me would have been able to handle things better but I smoked some A LOT of pot on Friday and it triggers my moods. I don't know how I'm going to get over this because my chemicals seem to be all out of whack. I just feel like life is a freaking rollercoaster of crap and I don't think I have the strength anymore. I just want to stay in bed for the rest of my life. I've also been single for a LONG time and it's because I've been unmedicated for most of my life until recently but I still have moments of crazy.

But I found a can of reduced sodium soup in my cabinet and there is no way my roommate or I would ever buy that. We both have POTS and are on high sodium diets. I got this deep seated feeling that either someone broke in and put it there or more likely there is some sort of supernatural shit going on and Im being haunted. I know rationally that this isnt true. But I still feel anxiety in my gut that Im being haunted and bad shit is going to happen. This is a pattern I tend to get really emotional about some conspiracy or something supernatural.

I never considered my overpowering urges and habits to be impulsebased and it is revolutionizing the way Im seeing things. I Googled around to learn more and I came across a bullshit shaming listicle from BP Hope I thought they were our friends!!! basically saying just discipline yourself!. As if everybody gets the impulse to stay up into the wee hours organizing their bathroom or the compulsion to spend their whole paycheck on something they didnt give a shit about a week ago or the brilliant idea to start their own business with no money but theyre just better at controlling it. At work it seems to take me twice the time to do things as everyone else and its largely due to constant small but uncontrollable things I have to do.Fuck all that.

45939,Massive disagreement between wife Bipolar Type II OCD and GADI really appreciate anyone that takes the time to weigh in on this.My wifes parents did not like me when we first started dating. They were incredibly restrictive and would only let her out to see me once a month. We got tired of that and started sneaking around to see eachother. During that time we had sex and for LDS culture that is wrong before marriage. Her parents are very strict Mormons and are the type to judge the hell out of you and spread rumors throughout the church.Come 5 months after dating they filed police reports that I was a sexual offenderrapist and needed to be imprisonment for the protection of their daughter. This paper they wrote up was so detailed i wouldnt be surprised it was in fucking MLA format. It was all based on things she had wrote in her journals which they photocopied as well and attached to the police report. They then destroyed her phone threatened not to let her go to church because I was there This went all through the regional church and suddenly my family and myself were completely ostracized. Incredible restriction went by for the next year and a half. During that time they started using the money in her banking account without her knowledge at all. They didnt stop until threatened to sue which under the circumstances I was able to which they then suddenly had all the money appear again. She was saving for when she turned 18 so we could get her the hell out of there. Which we did.Once she turned 18 she moved in with me we severed contact for months with her parents. They stated her sisters werent allowed to come to our apartment because they feared Id rape them. Blocked anyone that supported us from Facebook and any callingtexting and they went on like nothing happened.Now she has gone a long time without any support besides myself and my parents. We are still active in our church but one very far from where this all happened. She doesnt feel like she has any support from anyone so she started turning to her parents again. Her mom is incredibly manipulative and has proven herself to be.For the last few months she has been trying to essentially convince me that if I just let it go talk to them and suddenly be happy about it all again everything will be better.I was diagnosed with BPII only two months ago and before that I had to drop out of my double honors meteorology chemistry major program because my depression ruined my GPA lost my scholarships lost my job. Since then Ive been seeing a therapist twice a month changed all my Meds around and got my grades withdrawn and been recovering.My therapist was appalled to hear this story and thinks Im completely justified in not wanting to have anything to do with them. I have told my wife many times I will talk to them when Im ready and forgive them when Im able to let it go. But after she goes to dinner with them very Sunday this topic comes up where I need to forgive them start going to dinner and fix all this. The thing is she wants me to fix it her way and for what she wants. Which under other circumstances would be completely viable but I hate them. I hate her parents for two years of absolute hell. To this day they have never approached or tried to talk to me in person havent apologized. Nothing. For me that is the first step they need to initiate it. Then I will talk. My therapist agrees and honestly doesnt think I need to fix this at all right now and thinks Im completely justified in the way Im thinking.Am I over reacting? I dont know when Im overreacting with my anxiety and been in a depressed episode for a year now.Any thoughts would be appreciated.,Bipolar

50474,Possibly losing parenting rights due to bipolar disorder The most recent manic episode I had was after being depressed and diagnosed with major depressive disorder to be prescribed Zoloft. Within 6 weeks I was staying up for 9 days and delusional. I thought my partner was going to kill me so I called 911. The police arrived and I was very agitated and explained my delusions and they took me to the nearest psych ward for an evaluation. Unfortunately that psych ward didnt keep me long enough despite my volunteering to stay longer. They also gave me a medication I ended up allergic to which took treatment even longer.This resulted in asking my inlaws who live in a different state miles away to help me care for my daughter until I found the right medication combination and was stable. I knew it could take a few months and I had no one else available local to me. The only way my inlaws would take my daughter is if I signed over guardianship. I was under the impression it would only be for a year at the most. But honestly I wasnt really in the right mind to consent to that paperwork. I just knew I needed help and I did what I could to ensure my daughter had the best care possible while I got stable. Fast forward to now my partner and I petitioned the courts to end guardianship as I have been stable for 2 years. I have letters from my therapist and pdoc stating I am in treatment and stable and medication compliant. Well my inlaws are trying to prove I am unfit for things I did while I was manic so they can adopt my daughter without my consent or permission through the courts. They're also trying to prove that my partner their child is unfit I am less worried about that. My therapist says they're on a witch hunt and that they're just trying to raddle me and no judge would grant them adoption. I hope she's right. I just wanted to share what I am going through because 1. support would be nice. and 2. if anyone else is going through this you aren't alone.,Bipolar

50497,Switching meds planning pregnancy and moving across country. Recipe for disaster? For context I have type one and a history of 4 hospitalisations in 7 years. ECT worked amazingly but only for a while tried loads of medications and it seems like we've finally found a combo that works. I haven't had a serious episode for over two years now. I have a two year old son and despite the manic episode I had after four days is labour when he was born he's the best thing that has ever happened to my mental health. I love him to bits even though he was a surprise and I was totally sure I wasn't ready.Now my husband and I want a sibling for him. We both never had siblings of our own so he has no cousins and we both wish we had siblings. We want a baby sooner rather than later because the age gap keeps getting bigger. 3 years difference is ok but 4 seems like much more to me. I don't know. I've started taking folic acid and we should be ready to start trying to conceive in May. We also happen to be moving across the UK for my husband's work in July. If all goes well I could be pregnant by then.I told my psychiatrist this and he told me that my antidepressant clomipramine is dangerous to the baby in pregnancy and can cause serious heart defects. He wants to switch me to an SSRI citalopram which I've tried several of and they haven't done much for me in the past. Clomipramine worked for me I think because it's also effective in OCD and while I don't have OCD my depressive thoughts are definitely obsessive. I've been taking clomipramine for since a mild depressive episode I had a year ago and since I haven't had any depression at all and I haven't gone manic either.I'm just worried with the move even though I'm really looking forward to it and the pregnancy and the medication change might be too much. As a mother I feel having a serious episode is not an option but then am I just putting more pressure on myself? Is this crazy? Should I try it or wait another year with the baby? Even just changing medication worries me but I can't consider pregnancy without doing that first.I don't know exactly what I'm asking for here. Reassurance? Sanity check? Advice? Any and all of that is welcome.,Bipolar

50018,I'm ruining my sex life please help Okay I think this might be a bit long as I'm trying to include all the information so here we go.I f25 was diagnosed in mid 2021 but never categorized in 1 or 2. I was doing therapy combo biofeedback with the intent to get to emdr for a few months and taking 200mg lamotrigine and 10mg Lexapro but I haven't been to therapy in months because of distance and cost and I've been off my meds for months because the lamoteigine I think was causing me sleep problems. I work 9 hr days and 6 days a week most weeks while also helping my husband 35m with his online business usually don't get home most nights until 930. Here's where my problems start.My husband wants sex a lot. When we first got together we had sex every day for like a year. Then it started to slow some but was never really an issue. Now we have sex maybe once a week and it's putting a strain on our marriage. He feels like I don't love him or want him or want to be around him anymore. None of those are true and in my mind I have valid reasons for not wanting to have sex when he initiates. I have the kyleena IUD so I get some pretty painful cramps sometimes or I'm tired or it's late when we get home and I have to be at work a 6 am. Recently an additional pronlem is that I've become selfconscious about how I look again. He says I don't initiate enough or respond when he tries to get me in the mood. I tried to explain to him my reasons but he said I'm making it sound like a chore and sometimes it does feel that way until I'm actually in the act and enjoying it. It feels like too much work or too much sleep loss in exchange for little. I've gotten to the point where if we do have sex I prefer quickies. He also says that when I initiate when he's tried he doesn't turn me down unless he's exhausted.Things are very strained. I feel like I'm sleeping in bed with a stranger like an old fashioned we've never loved together or had sex before marriage type of relationship. I hate it and I hate that I can't pinpoint a cause or how to fix it. Is it mania? Depression? Stress? IUD? Exhaustion? Something I'm missing completely?I'll answer any questions that come up to explain more. Please someone help. I don't want to ruin my marriage.,Bipolar

I kept looking at the license plates of cars passing by and they all called to me in some way or another. I can't explain it but they all seemed to have special numbers related between them. I started writing them down and when I got home I analized them and I have the feeling they're all connected and they've all got something about them individually.

46345,Not Sleeping on New Meds I recently changed meds from Olanzapine to Vraylar because of side effect issues. I used to be on Seroquel until I got tardive dyskinesia. The past couple of weeks since I changed medications I've noticed that I feel on edge and wired for no reason. I fall asleep eventually but wake up 34 hours later feeling wide awake like someone gave me a shot of epinephrine. Minus feeling on edge my mood is more or less fine not up or down too much. Despite not really sleeping much I usually need 8 hours to feel human in the morning I am awake and fully functional during the day. Should I be worried that this is the start of a manic or more likely hypomanic episode or is this likely just me adjusting to my new medication? I am also on other meds that help stabilize my mood Lithium and Lamictal so this is an adjunct medication.,Bipolar

46928,What careers can BP sufferers succeed in? To start lets just say Ive had a very hard time getting my career together. Took me seven years to get a bachelors degree in Information Systems. My grades in subjects that interest me I excelled in and anything else I usually failed or received a sympathy D.My first Job out of college I was happy for about 6 months then I started struggling. This was well before I was diagnosed and started having intense panic attacks. I was able to hold that job for another year before I was let go right in the middle of the Great Recession.So I tried to freelance however I struggled. I would program for hours upon hours until I would crash after a few days. That led to poor quality work and I was in over my head. It was the perfect example of being overly ambitious and it led to me abusing Xanax to try and reduce the anxiety. I literally forgot two weeks of my life off of one binge.Luckily I was diagnosed and got on the right medications. Ive been sober for quite a few years but Ive had very little luck becoming financially independent. Thats kind of the cruelest thing about it because my mood has improved however Im still spinning my wheels. Im getting older and feel like Im running out of time to build any type of meaningful career.My question is what careers have bipolar sufferers been able to excel in? Is there anything that fits the personality type so to speak? Seriously need to know what careers would accept someone who is only productive 6 months out of the year and burns out quickly. I feel I need to work in a field completely different than what Im in because its just not working.,Bipolar

45997,How did the whole diagnosing process work ? Do you feel like it made your life better or worse ? Someone whose opinion I care about told me recently that he thinks I should go see someone and get medicated . It started kind of a big fight and at the time I was really angry because I didnt think he understood what was going on . I took some of the meds they would probably start me on when I was a teenager because of these seizures I was having and I told him I would literally rather die than take them again and feel the way they made me feel again . I hated being in a fog all the time not feeling anything at all ever the weird side effects . He tried telling me that I could tell them that and that it didnt have to be like that again but all I heard was youre being over dramatic and crazy . Which isnt really fair to him . Ive never been professionally diagnosed with anything ever but theres always been something not right . Its gotten worse the last few years more and more intense to the pint I dont even believe myself when I say I can handle it myself . I guess if Im being honest Im fucking terrified to even think about getting diagnosed and getting on meds . Im terrified of not being me anymore because even when I feel awful and like Im drowning in darkness I know that Im gonna get this high again and be ok . Im scared of getting told Im crazy . And Ive never admitted that before and now I feel more fucked up than before . ,Bipolar
46955,How can you explain your depressed but there is no real reason? I have been in an ongoing depression for almost 2 years. Yes I have had a few manic episodes but extremely short lived. I have BP1 and anxiety and several other things. I have no motivation to do anything. I have these ideas and know what to do but I just cant do it. When I start its like being in a hole with stuff constantly falling on me and I become so overwhelmed I just quit. I know people say its laziness and some of could be. But I know its something that isnt right. It is starting to affect my relationship with my husband and I myself. I am at a point where I just dont have any reason to do anything. I have had a chance at several interviews but when the time approaches I cant go thru with it. Its like Im terrified of having some kind of freak out at work and that cant happen again. I have lost all motivation and I take my medication religiously. I have been stable for several years my last hospital stay was in 2007. My medication has stayed the same but we went out of the country for 6 weeks and I have never been the same. Has anyone else just had that feeling that you know something isnt right but also terrified of talking to a psychiatrist because of medication changes. It took years to get my combo right. I have had so many reactions to most meds the thought of that just scares the hell out of me. I dont know why I felt like sharing but at least I know that everyone on here has had the experience of all the mood swings and manic and depression its like you can understand me.

46533,How I stopped letting anxiety spirals control my life xpost rmentallyhealthier I used to spend most of the day caught up in anxiety spirals. I used to fall into the trap of getting stuck in the past and beating myself up about mistakes or fretting about the way things could go wrong in the future. There's a term for this rumination. The only way I've found out of this terrible habit is through mindfulness meditation.Mindfulness is paying attention in a particular way on purpose in the present moment.Figuring this out the idea that you can live your life without reliving your life story has significantly improved my quality of life.I recently read this study httpswww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed19733812httpswww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed19733812The participants engaged in Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction therapy and the conclusion was the more mindfulness meditation had been practiced the less rumination was reported at followup assessment. Though the participants were in a full on 8 week course of therapy you can easily do this yourself with some effort.Basically the goal is to decenter from thoughts and emotions to see thoughts come and go without attaching any important truth or meaning to them.I'd recommend downloading the Headspace app it teaches this stuff in a very practical way and I found it to be very effective when I started out.,Bipolar

Not gonna lie still have some denial.. you know the Im not bipolar thoughts . However I take my meds because I know deep down there is some truth to the diagnosis . Anyone ever used to get a high when they bought stuff? I used to get this insane rush when I would buy things and spend money frivolously prior to being medicated. I did get myself into financial trouble. Now that Im medicated when I look at things to potentially buy I almost have the opposite feeling. I get out off by it all.

I had diarrhea every day it felt like my body was rejecting it. I was still sorely depressed. Then in September I got to start extended release lithium. I gradually felt better I got a job I felt more like myself. Then this last week I feel like I went through a period of hypomania. Probably relatively mild hypomania. I couldn't sleep without taking Seroquel my head felt on edge it sucked. Nothing about it was enjoyable.Right now it seems to have stopped I feel something akin to normal. But I'm scared.

46042,Rant I Guess. Hello sorry this is my first time actually posting on Reddit so I'm feeling a little nervous but it's all good.I'm a freshman in college and last October I finally saw a psychiatrist after years of struggling and got diagnosed with Bipolar 2 GAD panic disorder and social anxiety. We decided to try lithium and two other anxiety meds. I actually overdosed on the anxiety meds although I was taking the amount I was told and was having a lot of pain for like a few weeks so I wasn't really able to focus in my classes I got pretty behind and almost left on med leave. I'm now on Gabapentin and got started on Lamotrigine.I guess the lithium was working for a while but lately I have felt like an absolute mess. I will be in what feels like hypomania in the morning and be running around talking a mile a minute everything and then just get hit with depression and withdraw from everyone. Or vice versa. And this sometimes happens multiple times a day. I'm starting to feel crazy and it is taking everything that I have to just barely function nevermind actually having time to do homework or other responsibilities. I don't know what to do with myself. I just feel so terrible. It just feels like I can't achieve any sort of sane moment because if I'm not being affected by my BD my anxiety is at a 10. I just want to be calm and stable. I am just afraid of this starting to affect my family and my boyfriend. He is the most understanding person I have ever met but I feel like eventually he is going to get exhausted with me. I'm not a very happy person and I don't understand why anyone would want to spend time with me.I don't know anyone around here with BD and it is making me feel really alone which is why I guess I decided to make this post. I just feel so crazy I don't know. I'm sorry. ,Bipolar
46644,Hitting low I've had some really low lows and I think I'm headed for another one. It hit me so suddenly yesterday. I have an extremely long Self harm history and when my best friend released a new album with a self harm tw I got really scared and felt so small and vulnerable. It's stuck like that since then. It reminded me of when I was hurting myself daily and my drug habit and I'm just so lost right now. I was just manic how did this happen?,Bipolar
50267,For functioning more frequent regular tharapy or occupational tharapy? Ive been struggling with daily functioning. See the cluster fuck of a last post I had on here as case in point. Im not working because of PTSD plus bipolar making my brain panic mush. Im doing better than I have with episodes in the past. Im getting out of bed. Im doing care for my little family my husband and pets. Im mostly taking care of the kitchen and all food related things for the household.Im just resting a whole hell of a lot more than I want to. Im wasting away my day with nothing good to show for it. Probably 50 of the time Im awake Im in bed or sitting somewhere comfortable doom scrolling. I need to provide income so were not so tight on money. After consulting the hive mind of my friends and family everyone and myself have concluded that I need to start a business. I have an idea Id like to track down but I cant get going. Its become an extended issue. I just cant get going.I have a tharapist I love and I cant decide if I need to see her more often to work on this. Or if I need to go to occupational tharapy. Ive done occupational tharapy in the past and found if useful but Im not convinced it would be a second time.Ive met my deductible so more tharapy with my regular tharapist is free. Tharapy with occupational Id have to find in network. I live in a rural area so unless I can get virtual from the metro in my state it might be difficult to find something thats covered,Bipolar
50453,I am literally so tired of living like this I am 22f and I have bipolar type 2. I forgot my meds for two days and it triggered a depressive episode and im so pissed at myself because i thought i was doing good. Im so upset. I hate how it always ends back in this crazy headspace. I know its the bipolar but ohmygod this shit sucks so bad. I have to live my whole life with these random episodes of shit. Im tired. Sorry I am ranting. I just want a break for a year or something. Id do anything for relief from this disorder at this point,Bipolar
49619,i cant stop smoking. weed man. i dont get withdrawals when i stop or anything i just struggle so bad with controlling it. i promised myself id take this week off of smoking and from here on out at least taking 2 days off a week but ive already smoked 3 times this week. its the only fucking thing that keeps my moods under control when im home as my family is extremely toxic. i dont want this to turn into my old habits. ,Bipolar

49759,Bipolar x Anxiety x ADHD I was diagnosed as bipolar but honestly I don't know if I am. The signs I have seem to be more ADHD than bipolar including rejection dysphoria trouble concentrating procrastination etc. What I have that maybe are bipolar characteristics are sometimes I get irritated easily attachment issues maladptive daydreaming GAD and depression. But other than that I don't know if I'm bipolar. I am for now taking 450mg of lithium for 5 days. In 2 days I will increase to 900mg. I'm scared because I don't know if this is really my disorder. What happens to people who aren't bipolar but take lithium? I'm not feeling any positive differences it's just making me feel bad physically for now.,Bipolar
45825,Bad decisions. 32 M. BP1. I am in this viscous cycle of being depressed and wanting to alleviate those feelings. The easiest way is through deviant sexual stuff. Im happily married with a great family but its like I have to escape from the current situation of feeling horrible. Chatting w people online or attempting to chat w people is about the only thing that feels good. Then when Im manic I cant get enough and start doing the same stuff online. Then I feel super shitty about it a couple dayshours later and delete everything and stay away from it for a while. Only to be brought right back to the same place. Anyone else suffer from this sick circle?,Bipolar
46446,Getting help is extremely hard. Youre all so brave and Im proud of you! I work as a receptionist at a general practitioners office and any time someone comes in asking their options for mental health theyre usually shaking and you can tell theyve been crying. It ALWAYS reminds me of when I finally sought help after suffering for so long. I wish I could hug every one when theyre first getting help. I dont because thats weird but I really want to. ,Bipolar
46655,Doing well but life is definitely testing me right now. I had a what I'm assuming was a panic attack the other night cause I've only ever felt this sensation when I think really hard about some kind of medical condition I probably don't have. My vision went blurry and my ears were hissing. I remember fumbling with my breathing while wondering wtf was happening. I started taking deep breaths after figuring I might be having a panic attack. I ignored all my emotionally rooted thoughts and calmed myself down. Fuck. That. Shit. I feel for anyone who goes through anything like that regularly. That is down right terrifying to the piss your pants core.So I've been stable for about 6 months now doing what I'm doing and actually being successful how I perceive it anyways. I'm holding a job I'm loved by my peers and getting along with my parents better than ever. I've matured a lot I guess but being disciplined with my diet meds and sleep have made it all stay together.Just a couple weeks back my Mom got diagnosed with breast cancer... And I'm pretty sure the restaurant I'm working at is going to close soon because I've never seen a shit show like this EVER! Everyone is drunk and indifferent... It's sad. Aaaaaaand now my ex wants to talk on the phone today only have let her text me recently since making amends and healing our friendship. She's been sporadically contacting me telling me this or that reminded her of me... I really feel like she eventually prolly not today wants to try and rekindle things. She's expressed since finalizing our divorce how she feels she messed up and turned her back on me when I was simply severely depressed. I get that now and I understand why she did what she did and he don't blame her for it one bit. But I can't trust her anymore like that. She'll prolly drop me when I hit another dip in my journey. I'm overloaded right now. But I'm staying disciplined and trying to do everything how I need to to stay stable. It's working I guess but man this is the shitty part of life that usually puts me down for a year. I'm afraid but I'm excited to challenge my will through these tough times. Oh yeah I forgot in my rambling my parents whom I'm living with currently are selling their house and moving to a different city. Overall a good thing for all of us but keeping the house clean and sprucing it up for random showings today with a few hours notice is stressful.Stay positive peeps and keep on chugging along. Sometimes it's awesome cause sometimes it sucks.,Bipolar
50279,food as the main coping mechanism I eat a lot more after I started my meds. When I am stressed or under pressure I have a big appetite for food like sweets. I eat even more when manic even tho I am not hungry. I think I do it cause I have control over it but I see now how out of control it has gotten. I gained like 40 kg in 1 year and I am so unhappy with myself. I wish I could loos them kg over night. But the appetite never gets away and I eat again. It is vicious circle.,Bipolar
45579,Recent upset and trouble with meds. So i haven't been formally diagnosed because I'm not 18 but I'm currently on an atypical antipyschotic Saphris. Lately I've been having a few episodes. I'm extra irritable and my mood has been kind of volatile. Last week my long distance bf and i broke up. He was cheating on me and I've been really upset. I can't tell if what I'm feeling is normal or if it's a side effect of this disorder. I don't know if i should go up on my medications or ride this out. Does anyone have any advice or have felt anything similar? ,Bipolar
46293,Intense bursts of anxiety and stress I did a little bit of research prior to this but I couldn't find anything specific enough to my situation.Does anyone here get these intense bursts of like anxiety agitation and stress seemingly from out of nowhere?I always need to step away when I feel this way just to clear my head and it's over the most trivial things often a sudden change of plans or having to multitask e.g. being part of a conversation while getting texts I need to reply to.It completely overwhelms me to the point where I can't think straight. I get really snappy and rude and I feel terrible about it cause I can't control it and it affects the people around me. It's a very confusing feeling but it fades again after maybe 1020 minutes of clearing my head. That's also around the time where embarrassment kicks in and I start apologising for being so cold and rude.Can anyone relate? How do you handle it and maybe prevent it from overwhelming you?,Bipolar
49762,Im manic adviceinput please Disclaimer not asking if I'm manic Ik im manic I just am curious on if what I think caused it is even possibleWell it's official my guess was correct i know this because i've been crying for no reason and I was like oh im just dramatic then i started getting very irritable then paranoid and now I feel coked up. I hate it here idk what triggered it. Is it possible that realllly good news could have triggered it? Cause over springbreak I got the best news that the person who sexually assaulted me got suspended from the school. And I had like this burst of euphoria because I was so happy I stayed up for two days because I had so much energy but other than that I don't think I had any other symptoms. Last week tuesday is when the random crying episodes began. My ex has been trying to take care of me because I would just ball for no reason and I was trying to figure out why like i couldnt be alone or else i would start crying from anxiety and then on sunday I was so depressed I was staring off into space and wouldnt move or talk so my ex had to help me out of bed.Yesterday I had sugar and was like hm this is a suspisuous amount of energy. Then today after I got a good critique from my proffesor I got filled with energy then I ate food and drank water and now I have even more because when Im manic and I eat or drink water it makes the mania worse. But like seriously could good news have caused this? Over break I was also pretty inconsistant with meds but I was still taking them. Like I think I missed one night dose Which I've done before and I've felt compleltly fine. I take 300mg total 200mg morning 100mg at night of lamictal I was preparing for a depressive episode if i lost but now i'm having a mixed episode for the first time in a year which i was really happy about my winning streak against that and I havent been manic since like novemeber. Anyways from the way I'm typing im like 100 sure that I am and it's just been getting worse throughout the day. I need to take some hydroxizine that typically takes me down from the euphoria. Like I feel great but I hate feeling this happy and peppy and literally nausious from energy it's 3pm and I've eaten like four fried mozzarella sticks and that made me so stuffed.Okay sorry again do you think this good new could have triggered it? Because it wasn't until springbreak that i thought I was hypomanic but it's been like two weeks and the symptoms have gotten worse.,Bipolar
45471,Depression I am becoming increasingly depressed. Im very unhappy with my workFinancial situation. Im unhappy with my body. Im just unhappy. I feel like someone put molasses in my brain to gunk it up and slow it down.Besides contacting my doctor I dont know what to do. I tend to be manic and not depressed very often.,Bipolar
46846,Never gets better I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder late last year started meds was doing great! The best Ive been in years until my meds started giving me side effects. Its been about 2 weeks since Ive stopped the meds and realized that Im never going to get better. I cant function without meds. I just think its better to kill myself now 16 then let my life get worse. Theres no hope. Ill always be like this.,Bipolar
50348,Can you sleep when manic? When you experience mania are you able to sleep if you want to or are you unable to sleep?I find I have no problems sleeping when manic I just don't want to and don't really feel like I need it.,Bipolar
46440,Tegretol I got prescribed tegretol today for bipolar 2. Just wondering what I should expect to feel. I guess I thought that this feeling was just happiness but apparently it's mania? Kind of a shock to me actually but it makes sense. What does it feel like to be on a med like this? I've been taking zoloft for about 5 months and that's what triggered this mania. Waiting on my insurance to get tegretol 200mg 2x daily.Thanks.,Bipolar
45429,Manic Pixie Dream Girls? What are your views on the Manic Pixie Dream Girlhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiManicPixieDreamGirl trope in movies? Especially the ladies on here?While the characters aren't usually explicitly bipolar in films and more along the lines of having borderline personality as someone with BPD I personally find them more cringeinducing than relatable Despite attracting the same kinds of guys. Ugh. and I kind of hate the term. ,Bipolar
46512,Doctors appointment I have a doctors appointment on Monday. How do I go about mentioning I feel I may be bipolar without them looking at me like an idiot ,Bipolar
50136,You guys I cant feel anything during sex anymore and it is driving me mad. Ok hear me out. Im on 100 mg of Zirprasidone and I take Propanolol for anxiety. My meds help me tremendously like I hardly even have any bp symptoms anymore. But heres the thing I cant feel anything during sex anymore. Nothing not a thing. Literally nothing. Its driving me nuts! I can feel sex but I cannot feel any pleasure during sex anymore and it makes me feel left out and sad. Should I tell my psychiatrist about this? What do I do? Its to the point where I get sad every time I have sex now.,Bipolar
50048,Needing advicesupport I had a manic episode about 6 months ago that has completely derailed my life. I quit my dream job burned professional bridges too left my home and my Roomate to find another place to live quickly moved to a city where I knew no one left personal belongings behind racked up 14k in credit card debt. I met someone I shouldnt have trusted and helped him buy a car. Luckily I was able to sell it but I also bought myself a new car I didnt need. I am now 10k underwater in a car loan and had to move back in with my parents. I am close to 30 years old. My professional career is destroyed and I lost most of my friendships. The ones I still have now keep me at a distance due to my behaviors. Everyone says that they didnt recognize me at all during this time and I am ashamed. I am unemployed in debt and unable to function normally. I have memories surface of the episode still and it sends me into the deepest despair.. I feel like there is no point in living anymore. I dont know how to exist in this new reality of my life.Anyone who can relate?? Or is my situation just extremely crazy?,Bipolar
46614,Hypomania I can't ignore the red flags anymore! It's not just because it's finally spring that I'm feeling this good. It's not just because it's spring that I'm this active. I'm getting up at 4 am cause I'm just not tired anymore. I never sit downIt's not only happiness that makes me laugh so much even though I'm doing really well generally speaking.I have to admit to myself that I'm hypomanic. I've been riding the high for a couple of days getting things done but it has to stop now before it gets worse.I've started dating this guy that I've wanted to date for years.He knows I'm bipolar he just doesn't know what bipolar is just yet. Or how it affects me. And my surroundings. We were on the phone last night and i was... Not in control. At all. He was so confused and i don't blame him.I was at a meeting today and i could. not. sit still.Every spring is the same! April is rough.may is soo good.June is meh. Juli is sweet.August is sweetSeptember is kinda melancholic. October is heartwarming and cozy.The rest of the year is fine.But spring? Soo sweet and full of promise...Anywho... Tonight I'm taking my sleep meds on top of my regular meds. That usually stops hypomania. At most in a couple of days. I should have done it yesterday.,Bipolar
46713,Forgive! and Forget? I don't often let people do unforgivable things and get away with it. At 37 and BP1 it's just easier to let those bridges burn. Occasionally though there are those few people in my life that rarely if ever hurt me but it has happened recently. After multiple conversations with said person we have decided to move past it amicably. It's important to me that this person remains in my support circle. Anyway I have forgiven them without problem. I'm a pretty open person and people fuck up. It's life. It's how we recover from it. Well... I can't seem to forget it. I'm having trust issues and generally feel not so great when I'm around them. Like a bad energy kinda feel bad. The last few days I've had this overwhelming sense of dread. I don't know. Does anyone else experience such issues and if so how have you dealt with them? Oh yeah on top of everything I've been rapid cycling daily within a mixed episode for a few weeks. It's starting to wear on me more than I'd like.,Bipolar
46303,I can't stop crying A year ago I got out of a 7 year relationship A year ago I got sober off alcohol I don't understand why I'm feeling so horrible all these feelings are here nowWhy? Why now!? I grieved his loss and got over itIt feels like I'm going through all of it all over again Is this normal? Can anyone relate?,Bipolar
49712,off my meds for two weeks! Its 1am and im so happy right now lol sleep? no fucking way i wanna go work out So what do you guys do when youre wired in the middle of the night? I might go to the gym again tbh it was fun today. I should rest tho before i hurt myself. What kind of drinks help you guys sleep? Or calm down?,Bipolar
50462,Has anyone tried Fanapt or have experiences? My psych just prescribed me 1mg fanapt and Ive never heard of it before. Just wanted to see if anyone has had experiences with it. Its also hard to get I had to special order it to a specific pharmacy.,Bipolar
50479,Has anyone ever... Has anyone ever stumble or read about something that could happen in the future and you start feeling weird and anxious and scared that it WILL happen because you read it as if you could manifestwill the scenario into existence? because you feel like you have abilities to predict it to happen?? and the thing would probably never happened if you didn't read it.,Bipolar
18402,So every expert has told me that once I stopped smoking pot after awhile I would not be so depressed. Today after 4 weeks I passed a drug test! Problem is that I am still depressed like I was before as a user. Nothing has changed at all! I feel completely wronged. I am really thinking about just saying f it and smoking a joint. Anyone else have this problem? How could the experts be so wrong? Stopped smoking pot and still depressed,Depression
38270,i ll try to keep it a short a possible for the past year i have been struggling with frequent wave of deep depression lasting for day or week but at the same time i have time where im just ok dont have any self esteem issue self image issue and etc so in the end all im trying to figure out if this is normal or if it a type of depression though i couldnt find anything similar to it or bipolar disorder which also seems somewhat unlikely because i never have manic or extremly energetic episode i just want to know if what im dealing with so ill have a clearer idea about how to act further,Depression
25496,Our society sucks. I mean it is definitely better than it was at least mental health is becoming more normalized. However it still has a long way to go. Currently helping out my sister in law with what kind of lie that is based in truth to tell her boss why she needs a semi urgent doctors appointment. Because even though employers say they support mental health we all know the levels of acceptance and denial in the work force and she does not want to look weak and emotional in front of work competitors and miss out on promotions. Currently we are going with the doctors appt for sleep apnea and doctors appointment for anemia rout since anxiety induced insomnia is part of the problem and anemia really could be part of it. Obviously not going to mention the suicidal ideation part! Figuring out the best lies to tell your employer when getting urgent help,Depression
38142,i don t think i m being irrational i know that nobody will ever want to be with me romantically im getting more depressed by the day and i already notice my few friend distancing themselves i can t blame them i m sure i m not fun to be around there s very few people with whom i feel like i can share how i m really feeling but doing so just push them away i need my life to be different not to be stuck in this worthless body i need optimism but there s none left in me i don t think i ll ever be able to kill myself so it s just going to be 0 0 0 maybe even 0 or 0 more year of this void maybe i ll be struck by lightning or something finger crossed,Depression
18571,I have never been so close to just ending my life. I have been unable to walk for over a year and just got another job again. However my left leg is not doing so well and I will probably need surgery. I have had multiple surgeries on my right knee got denied workmans compensation and eventually lost my job because my FMLA was up. A few weeks ago my girlfriend left me for someone else and all I want to do is take the leftover percocet I have from my operations. I did everything for her and bent over backwards always there for her when she was suicidal but when I told her how I felt she left me and said good luck. Discarded like a used fucking tampon. I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for about 14 years now and every day just brings me closer. Work in 5 hours and I cannot sleep I am not sure what to do guys. I have nobody and I keep telling myself being alone is okay but sometimes it is not. I felt like I was making so much progress with my trust issues but she fucked it up so bad. I am so tempted to take these pills guys. Even if I did kill myself she still would not care. She left me to die no remorse. I still have some goals but if my body keeps breaking and I am not able to obtain them... I just do not know anymore. Rock bottom.,Depression
20887,I feel so alone and lonely and it hurts. Its scary tbh. It stresses me out. I am not sure if this belongs here but I feel so alone,Depression
22903,I do not know if it is just me who deals with this but I never honestly confess my true depressed thoughts if anyone asks about my mood. It just feels so wrong and almost attention seeking I do not want to be a burden for anyone. So I just pretend to be okay although most of my friends know of my diagnosis and struggles. But as soon as anyone else opens up about not doing okay I feel so wrong and disgusted by myself. I feel sorry for them and bad myself. I feel like garbage for telling them I had a good day right before them confessing they have not. I hate this. Feeling bad because others are able to confess their depressed feelings but not me,Depression
18697,My depression started at the beginning of May and it feels like a week ago. Its already the middle of July and I am just amazed at how time goes fast when you are at your darkest and lowest fucken point. I have been getting better and healing over this month though but that was just an observation I made. Time goes fast when you are depressed,Depression
12946,Obvious throwaway. I have just lived life just I do not know just living so that my little sister does not lose her older sibling. I had a family once. Two families united. It was not perfect but it was a family. My grandmother always hated me she would tell me that I was useless at the age of 8 and that i would grow up to be a fat and useless slob that would attain nothing in life. My father well he never really cared for me he would let his mother talk about me and say all of this to me. I am now known as the recluse of the family who is a failure. My father believes in many superstitious stuff. My parents were going to divorce when I was 13 it shattered my whole reality. I lost vision of what family even was. That was the day that i lost both sides of my family. My father brainwashed me by suggesting certain ideas to the point that i could envision them in my mind. He used me to get back with my mother. I ruined my mother and my sisters life for being weak. Years pass family still broken. Have been diagnosed with severe depression. Dad talks ill about my mother and accuses her of adultery with women. I try to defend her he believes nothing but the superstitious beliefs and advice that his family and peers offer. I have done nothing yet I have been beat physically and mentally. I am not even loving for myself. I do not know what to do anymore. I have always wanted to die since I was a child but I have held on long enough for my little sister. I cannot keep doing this. My mind is breaking. I feel myself slipping away. No one wanted me in this world not even my own family. My own father my own grandmother and the paternal side of the family. I was the oldest grandchild but i was always belittled so that the smaller boy could be seen as the prodigy. I was nothing. I am dirt. I am trash. I want to die I am so weak. My sister has tried to make me feel better for what I have attained in life. I did not attain it because I wanted to I only did it because it was expected of me. I do not know what I am doing with my life. I can envision no future. I am broken. No person will want me as their partner. I want to die. I need to die maybe that way i can free my family of the shackles of a useless parasite as my dad called me. I can tell my own mother dislikes me too deep down. Why would not she it is my fault my father is still in our life. He broke her too. She is beyond repair. I have doomed us all. Both sides of the family hate each other. Death threats have happened attempts at murder have happened. I do not think i deserve to live. Autism and severe depression are nothing but a joke in my father's and mother's eyes. I am meant to be normal like everyone else who is able to live life headstrong. I cannot take this anymore. I have never had anyone and i never will. So many thoughts so much i want to say nothing comes out. No one really cares. it is all a facade. Deep down we are all selfish. it is okay the weak like me are not meant to survive. I am weak. I am nothing. For anyone willing to read.,Depression
22196,Makes me feel real good. And people wonder why we are killing ourselves Love seeing 8 men are trash just for existing lol posts in a row on twitter while I am depressed,Depression

26280,I have the most amazing loving parents and sibling for whom I would do anything and sacrifice everything. I also have food on my table everyday a roof over my head phones a console a laptop stable internet etc. yet I hate my life. I do not think there has been a day where the thought of dying has not crossed my mind. I just feel... Sad. I feel like a spoiled brat who is faking these feelings and should be grateful for everything he has I feel like a good for nothing idiot who only knows how to disappoint and worry people and I also feel like a waste of space who has nothing interesting to say and annoys people in social situations. I try and hide these feelings in order to not worry my family but I cannot be bothered with anything anymore. I have also tried having a more positive outlook on life lying to myself that if I were to try harder everything would be better. That has not worked. I do not even know why I am venting here when I have everything I could ever want in life. I just want to disappear. I have been blessed with a wonderful life but i cannot remember the last time I genuinely felt happy.,Depression
38348,so i live in a small country in asia in this country it s like if you love someone you get a bad reputation your mom or dad is shamed at school if their kid is caught dating someone who doe that and our phone are also being checked by the school to see if we disturb a girl or are in a relationship with them the parent here are like you can date after being married xd so yeah i am very annoyed and sad about the fact that i can t love someone cuz of these,Depression
26937,My parents got divorced when I was 5 I am 16 now and they kept telling me terrible things about each other they still do I used to visit my dad once a week and I do not really have much memory with him. All I remember is him telling me about my mom and such a monster she is the whole they same as my mom and all those times I was wondering which parent should I trust Btw sorry for my English I am not sure if I am using the right Grammer Three years ago he got his first child from his new wife and he stopped seeing me we still see each other But it is like twice a month or less I feel like I never had a good time with him and I do not really feel close to him as I should feel to my father I really want to fix this and get to know him better I kind of feel jealous to my half siblings What should I do to get closer to my parents? How should I get closer to my parents?,Depression
17457,I did not fucking ask to be hereBut now I am here and people love me and they will be devastated if I leave and I cannot do that to them. When I am around other people I feel ok anyway. So fine ok I will not kill myself. I will do it just for you loved ones even though living is misery every second of every day I have no spark inside and I just want to sleep. But I will get out of bed just for you to make you happy. BUT..... Society keeps societying does not it?I cannot just 'stick around' for Your sake. I have to actively work. I have to work hard. and I have to work hard in the way that society wants me to. cannot just be a part time barista oh no. that is embarrassing and also I will be homeless within a month. No I have to study and internship and make something of myself. And even then I better study the right thing. Because we only appreciate CERTAIN KINDS of hard work around here. But I do not fucking want to LIVE let alone WORK TO LIVE. Is this a joke? I hate myself. I hate society. I hate being here and I do not fucking want to be here!! I am only here because it will make people sad if I leave!! But here I am shoveling societies shit because I am not allowed to JUST exist!Fuck off! I hate it! Either let me kill myself or let me simply exist!! I would not mind staying alive for my loved ones if I did not also have to fucking fight like a dog to survive.,Depression
23408,Everybody hates me. My roommate who is supposed to be my best friend hates me. She will not admit it but she does. We do not do anything fun together. We do not spend any time together. We just coexist or we are fighting. I think she is grown to resent me more and more as time has went on. Its just another failed friendship. Another thing I fucked up. Without her I do not have any friends. Even my dog likes Erin more. She always wants to spend time with her and not with me. She never wants to be around me. I am a bad trainer and owner. I have no one to talk to. Everyone is tired of listening to me. They get mad or frustrated or depressed or anxious if I talk about how I feel. I have a therapist but I only talk to her for an hour a week and it does not really help anyways. Even my parents do not want to listen anymore. I should just shut up. I should just not exist at all. I do not have any friends or any reason to live. I keep trying but its all useless. I wish I was dead. I wish I never existed. I am tired of feeling so alone and tired and useless and like a failure all the time. I am tired of fighting every day. I am so tired. I am never going to be good enough. I am never going to be loved. I just want it all to stop I do not have anything new or interesting to say,Depression
15694,I am tired. I am just going to kill homeless people. if you can track this page to where i live come and find me and call the cops. you will deserve the reward. if not let me be and ill gas light this whole fucking house and ill hide butane in peoples bushes so it will lead to their house and willl eventually kill at least 30 people and 5 houses after years of trauma mental and physical abuse I have finally fucking snapped,Depression
22701,Yeah I am back again to mention something else. also I put 2 comments in my last post. My father also verbally and mentally abuses me. He calls me useless ugly shit etc often. When I forget to do stuff he yells at me mean phrases which I do not want to mention and also picks something up or uses his hands to make a motion like he is about to hit me. One time he put the back not sharp side of a knife at my neck. When I was a bit younger he also choked me by my neck. I am just discussing this and even so my life is terrible I do not want to bring the police into this. I am just too scared and also I may pass out if I se the police go to where I live. I do not deal with those situations or the one I am having in my life now. Letting it all spill out just makes me feel better. I hate my life 2,Depression
15940,I just exist because I have nothing else to do. My job is boring my life is boring I think my only friend does not even like me anymore I only get texts when my fwb wants to fuck and I do not even like sex anymore. Even when I am playing online video games I am asking myself wtf is happening in my life. I have been trying to make new friends to go outside and talk with people but maybe I am the problem. I am a boring person with a boring life boring stories and I get ghosted after a couple of messages. Man I do not even GAFOS about life anymore. I feel... numb. My family tells me I look like a street dog when someone tries to be friendly you know always scared to be beaten and expecting to be hurt again. But that is my life now this is who I am right now. I have been ignored ghosted and treated like shit lately and I became so plain nobody likes me anymore. Remember that feeling when you had a crush a dream or expecting something from life itself? I miss that feeling. I wake up at 6 am every single day with zero calls zero messages not a single person asks me if I am still alive.And do not come and say get out of your comfort zone or do not expect something from others. because you are as broken as I am. IDGAFOS anymore. I am an NPC in someone else's life. I do not even feel like ending my life anymore. I do not feel anything just a void.,Depression
23235,You know how white women in America complain about period shaming when a dumbass man makes a she must be on her period joke? Well I have another scenario to raise you....Has anyone ever made sure no one touches you for 3 days and make you not enter the kitchen and make you wash your clothes and bowls separately and not even hand food to you directly but instead place it on a nearby table for you to pick it up because they might accidentally touch you or say they cannot reheat food in a bowl you already touched because it is impure to bring it back into the kitchen and scream at you for sitting to close to other people therefore accidentally brushing up by them making them impure as well?No? Well I guess my dad is just special. Yes I live in America in 2021 and have lived here for 20 years and my dad still does this. A quirky thing my abusive father likes to do,Depression
11047,Is anyone else trying to rebound? I am thinking I am facing an endoflife scenario. there is nothing left I want to do alone and I have failed to meet anyone new. All my old friends are gone. Next 12 months look like the end of the road. A deadend. everyone is plans for the next 12 months?,Depression
39499,so because of my anxiety i have this big fear of being alone i m afraid that i will lose my mind and hurt myself or something i constantly surround myself with people and when my partner leaf town i have family stay with me i feel like this is kind of becoming a problem because i m never facing my anxiety alone so when i m alone driving or doing anything else alone i panic,Depression
26336,I am a student and work parttime.Today my professor shamed infront of my whole class for not being able to pay my fees on time. I need help to cover part of my semester fees as i could not earn much due to covid. I do not know what to do.I feel hopeless. I do not know how to show my face again in class. I am feeling so ashamed. I will be grateful to anyone who can help. I got shamed infront of my whole class for not being able to pay my fees on time,Depression
8642,Who else knows the feeling of going into a new place but knowing that the new people you will meet you will disappoint when they get to know you? I started a new job and while I am still looking for work from home jobs this job is so hard to wake up to every morning. The work itself requires a lot of emotional labor and is the kind that does not finish. People were nice to me here at first but the way that I am I do not act the way I look I guess. I am way too shy do not take risks naive. Now its lucky if people look my way. I was never good with people and coming back to work with other people reminds me of that and its just frustrating all over again. I get headaches at the end of the day. And then I have to do it all over again the next day. I tried this job but Ill need to find something new. Its a cycle,Depression
25739,Title says it all really. The hours inbetween socializing with friends are slow and agonizing.My brain gets scared that I annoy my friends or that I will say something to hurt them intentionally so I make excuses that I need to take a break for a few or that I should probably go to bed.All lies of course because I lay in my bed and idolize a world in which I do not exist. Sleep is just a way to fall back into my nightmares of living in a world where I feel content happy even only to have it ripped away from me when my eyes open.I only feel like myself when I drink but even then I struggle to pick up the bottle because do I even like who I really am? Or is it really even me or just an amalgamation of ideas of what I would want to be all sewn together poorly?I feel I have no purpose in this life and even though they would all say otherwise I feel as if I truly have no one in this world. Surrounded by people who care yet I have never felt more alone,Depression
12490,TWI've gone on a very bad downward spiral again recently. I tried to take my own life back in '18 spent some days in the psych ward. Some of you have probably been there too.Since then I have not really gotten better I have just crawled my way into surviving with a strenght I was not sure I had. Two weeks after the attempt I went back to work and I now realize damn that is so f up. It was like now hurry up and be profitable againI quit that job last year before the pandemic. Since then I tried to get another job. I recently landed one which I was really hoping was just going to be something I could handle. Woopdeedoo. How do I fool myself every time. Two months later here we are I collapsed hard this time more from my anxiety than from my depression. I just told my boss I was sick until I could figure out what to do. I called my psych she knows me well. She told me she suggested at least a month off. I know this company would kick me to the curb if I take one month off so I though it was better to resign saying I got another job offer patch it up bye bye.What else can I do other than try my hardest to fix the things this mental illness causes as best as I can? Nothing else.My mom understands. Not everything because no one who has not had a mental illness can fully understand it. But she is supportive. she is been my anchor all this time. She is the sole reason I am typing today I would no doubt be gone if she were gone. Things is I moved back here last year after quitting my job. The reason I moved was because my grandma who I was living with since 2012 had a stroke and now needs a fulltime caregiver. it is a two bedroom apartment so I had to get out. I guess my stepfather who sees me as daughter pft has not really liked that. I guess he feels like always as if I were here to try and steal my mom or something. I actually felt bad and I thought maybe I am being an obstacle between a couple even though being honest and kind to myself quite rare I have helped the hell out of them after he was diagnosed cancer last year and I took care of the house while they were gone.I think now he just wants me out. I am quite impressed at his lack of care despite being a firsthand witness of my attempt in '18. I asked my mom because I felt something was off they are gone til tomorrow. She said he I quote is worried that I will never be able to live on my own.I do not know if she does but I do see the meaning behind those words. it is a not very subtle get out of my house and leave me alone with my wife. I guess I should have seen it coming knowing the only love that is unconditional is my mom's. As I wrote down this post I calmed down a little bit. Right now I need to get back on my feet. I will resign from this job because there is no way I can handle it next week or ever. I will work with my psychiatrist to get me back to semi functional as I like to call it. Then I am grabbing my money and I am getting the hell out. Screw this. Screw him and his expectations. He can shove his fake care and love up where light does not reach. He has the nerve to judge me the nerve to expect me to go on after I collapse when he has two kids 32 and 27 who have NEVER. WORKED.NEVER.I guess I kind of answered myself in this post but I would still appreciate any input you might have. I feel stronger now. I feel angry. that is good angry is better than guilty. Eventually I know I will just let go of him because I do not live with resentment. How am I going to manage once I leave? I have no clue. But I cannot manage here anyway either. And if I am not wanted then I shall go.The good side of me still wishes him good. The good side of me cries at how stupid I am because amidst having a mental breakdown I felt so happy that yesterday he was told his cancer treatment ends next month. I was so genuinely happy because I do love him. I guess I am just not loved back. And you can tell me he loves me in his own way but I do not believe in that. You either love someone or you do not. Thank you for the space. I will be down and up and down and up again. But I think eventually I will just pack up my things and go. And remind myself yet again every day that love is absolutely conditional. How do you deal with the judgement and disappointment of others when they realize you are not who they expected?,Depression
39094,hey all i m 0 and i started taking 0mg citalopram in summer last year i had no side effect except for a decreased appetite and worsened insomnia i already suffered with that though everything wa going well until the start of this year when my anxiety suddenly got out of control my doctor think i grew resistant to the 0mg or something my dose wa increased to 0mg the end of feb for the first week i felt fine but then i started to feel nauseous the second week then over last weekend i began to be physically sick i take citalopram in the morning a soon a i wake up because i used to take it at night and it wasn t good for my insomnia a well a this for the good of being completely transparent i am a social university student who doe enjoy drinking even though alcohol wa fine with 0mg could it be possible that it is not now i know this is an important piece of context hence why i m including it basically did anyone else suffer with nausea and vomiting after increasing their dose should i be concerned that it s been week since starting the new dose and my side effect haven t settled also how worried should i be mixing citalopram with this new dose when i wa fine when i drank on 0mg thanks for any advice,Depression
13342,I am taking Venlafaxine. it is an SSRI. does not cure my depression but it certainly takes the edge off. Are you on medication? Are you on medication?,Depression
8823,How high should it be to kill you?If you are here to say something else than answering my question do not because that will make things worse.I have decided what way and have few areas in mind but I need some further answers. I do not want to screw up and end up in a wheel chair or so for the rest of my life. I get that while you jump off a bridge you probably have seconds to realise and regret what is happening but that is fine. I have suffered for years seconds is nothing to me.Is 10m 100m 300m enough? If I land in water how high? etc... Thanks How high should a bridge be?,Depression
24813,And I do not think anybody ever will. Nobody loves me.,Depression

10401,hey all just wanted to ask if saying that I am depressed and suicidal to my mother ok? My family is shit I hate most of my brothers but I know my mom might care about me but she would be horrified that I have tried to suicide right... What should I do? I want some honest advice,Depression
25978,I am going through a pretty rough time. In the morning when I wake up I just feel a sort of dull sadness and I am very listless as I go about the morning. Then midday hits and I am just completely down. No energy nothing cheers me up. Then as the sun goes down I start getting that panicky sad where I feel like I am just going to burst into tears at any minute. Its the same pattern every day and I cannot stand it. Is this normal? Is it normal to feel a certain kind of sad in the morning and a different kind as the day goes on in the same pattern consistently every day?,Depression
16220,It took year 30 to accept that i was depressed for most of my 20s. I did not work very over weight i laid on a makeshift bed on the floor all day and night went no contact with the very little friends i had hoping for the day i had the courage to finish it....but I never questioned why i felt like this. One day my mom took me to Mexico because apparently i had black magic casted on me.....total BS in my opinion but.......but that trip was the breath of fresh air i need because I final understood and accepted that I was depressed.....I had a sickness that can be cured mananged really to be honest I still have stints of depression but mostly the physical aspect no negative thoughts. I have a decent life good job own placecar still working on the weight loss but I am doing my best with the extra years I was given on that trip to Mexico. People always ask the question what would you do if you could back in time? Obviously never going to happen. The closest to this is that if a younger person than me reads this and feels how i felt Its okay to admit and accept that you have depression because that is the first step to recovery do not feel ashamed admission is the first step. First step is admission,Depression
38551,somewhat a depression post but i feel a if i don t know what my preference is i like men and woman but at the same time i ve never felt that emotionally just sexually am i just a weirdo or is their a statement for it,Depression
17595,So i was just minding my business at the trainstation waiting for my train to go to scchool after a stressful morning at my workplace. It was around midday and it was raining badly i just sat down on a bench near me and tuned into some music when suddenly this old lady just sat down next to me and started talking to meSo.. weekend now huh? She asked me. I put down my headphones and replied with not really still have to work a shift on saturday. I really was not interested to chitchat with her so i hastily put my headphones back on or atleast tried to. Before i actually put them on she said Ah school. Which grade are you in? I quickly replied again grade 10 before she turned her head to me and smilingly said You have a great future ahead of you! I doubt that but thank you. i said back. There was a small moment of silence but the old lady eventually broke it with her words You know.. you need to stop troubling yourself with the past. you are young and strong there is no need for you to worry about a tiny fraction of your life which is the past. Start focusing on the future.. better yet yout future! Forget your age and focus on your future because only you can shape it the way you want. do not try and change the past because it already solidified into your life but your future on the other hand.. If i were you I would use your young strength and willpower to shape a future that would suit me right. I would give allot just to go back in time and tell my young self everything I have just told you because i know i could have done better than i actually did. If i did better in the past then maybe now i would not have to take the train to my last days of work everyday haha. Well here goes my train.. take care of yourself okay darling?With those words she entered the train and waved goodbye to me. I had abusive parents so i never got such advice and honestly it felt magical to hear something like that. I just needed to share this with someone and hopefully this advice will help some of you on here like it helped me.Keep on going you all! Had a smalltalk with an old lady at the trainstation today.,Depression
9508,Does anyone else ever feel invisible? I just feel like I do not matter. My voice is never heard. My feelings are not valid or my opinions are not smart enough. My family members never let me finish a complete thought. Someone always wants to finish my sentence and it could not be further from what I am trying to say. It hurts to feel like I am not a complete person. I have not always been around my family due to being in active addiction most of my young adult life. But now I am in recovery 4 yrs and I am around them all the time. They do not make me feel bad about my past but I feel like I do not get the same respect as everyone else. it is frustrating and I just want to be heard. Invisible,Depression
15194,i hate college. i know its not suppose to be easy but its way too stressful. i might fail this class I am currently in and i do not know what my parents will do if i fail. i just want to be able to focus on me and my life and wellbeing for once and not work and school. i want to take time off school but I am scared because my family would hate me for it and idk where i would work. id feel like a failure too if i did that. i do not know what to do. 1 in 5 college students are so stressed out they consider suicide. i am that 1 in 5.,Depression
38406,i know this is weird to ask but anyone got any alternative to cutting i m too scared to punch a wall not scared enough to not cut somehow and i can t cut without getting caught due to helicopter parent they have caught me cutting so my mother doe body check regularly again i know it s weird to ask but any suggestion are appreciated,Depression

19955,Yet one thousand steps back One step forward,Depression
25148,we have come to know each other so well. We almost seem like a couple. I know she is really fond of me as I am of her but in a different way. She has texted me 'I love you' as a form of appreciation the friendship kind of one and I can never say it back. If I would say it back I would mean it in another way. The way that would be considered impossible due to the incompatibilities regarding our sexual orientations. I cry a lot. I think it is the feeling of a treasure within inches of reach but knowing I will never get to grasp it. Our relationship is a perfect one but an impossible one. I M20 am in love with my lesbian best friend,Depression
22690,I barely do stuff anymore and every day just feels the same no one likes me and I am just burden i just really feel like i should kill myself but I am just trying not to. Nothing feels good anymore i do not want to live anymore.,Depression
7074,I am 31. I was living my perfect life for 7 years. Prior to that I was depressed and felt lost in life. I was engaged to my soulmate the one person I felt Id spent my life searching for and could not live without. We had a beautiful 4 bed house in need of work which I was working hard on renovating. I was also at university getting a bachelor of science in CGI having realised finally what I wanted to do with my life. I was a whirlwind of happiness and productivity. We were looking forward to when I graduated so we could work more on the house together get married finally and start trying for a baby. For the first time in my life I had lasting longterm happiness it was beautiful. The week I graduated she told me she would fallen out of love with me and there was nothing to be done. I think my absence and stress due to uni had turned me into a burnt out argumentative and barely present person over lockdown. She had ownership of the house so I lost that too and had to move back in with my parents. I had so much work still to do to create a showreel and get a job and was kind of looking forward to doing it but now I have lost all passion for my work. Its been 3 months and I still dream about her every night. I lay in bed drifting in and out of consciousness until the afternoon unable to face another day of rotting away in my parents dark spare room. The amount of daylight I waste in bed means I have to spend more of the worst loneliest hours of the late night unable to sleep.I do not want to die I just want my old life back but that is never going to happen. My existence is utterly intolerable. My life crumbled in a week I lost everything I am now a lost soul,Depression
12428,My lifestyle should be indicative of someone who is happy. Exercise regularly work eat well read go for long walks etc. yet I never ever just get that feeling of feeling good that is the best way I can describe it. I sometimes am distracted by the deep feeling of meaninglessness that life is but it always returns there is nothing I want in life sex drugs money do not do anything for me I do not want kids or marriage. Drink drugs sex money none of it makes me happy when it comes along when it would have years ago. there is no relief. do not ever feel good,Depression
13424,i do not have anyone. I am tired of crying and throwing up. i just want it to end. why am i so lonely? why am i less deserving of having friends than everyone else? ,Depression
40102,people don t care unless it affect them i hate people,Depression
15236,For the last 2 Months I have been really struggling. Everyone in my life thinks things are getting better and that I am starting to get a handle on my depression but really I have just been telling a series of lies so no one realises how low I have fallen.I do not know how to make it better. I keep telling myself if I can just get my home cleaned up if I can just get myself to go to work if I can just make one little step forward then everything will be okay. But that one little step is either never enough or to hard to make.I am now at a point where I have been off work for 2 weeks and tomorrow I am going to have to go back and I know that as soon as I walk through the door Ill be fired. I get it. And I have made what plans I can to get by but I hate myself so much for letting it get to this point. I always wonder why cannot I be appreciative of the opportunities I have. Maybe if I was more grateful I would not mess up so much.I really need some support and words of encouragement to carry me through what I know Is going to be a hard day tomorrow. I really hope there is someone out there to read this because I just cannot be alone anymore. I cannot handle it all alone anymore. About to be fired,Depression
48025,I am filled with envy pride and resentment. I will start of by saying that I may or may not be suffering from depression. Ever since I turned 21 I started feeling jelous towards my peers profesionally academically relationship wise. I am 27 now and things haven't really improved.Everytime I try to share these emotions with someone namely my mother she just brushed them off and made no big deal out of them. Telling me to just man up basically. When I shared them with friends they either said nothing or told me to get over it.. as such I bottle these feelings because it seems to be a nuisance to other people. Fucking assholes.I feel envy profesionally because I do not work in the places I wish to work and for positions I want to work at. I am underpaid working a job I have grown out of for years.Relationship wise I barely have any friends anymore after college. No partners due to me not taking the initiative to do so. Not due to lack of confidence but due to constant daydreaming and fantasizing about being in a relationship instead of actually pursuing it.I do not feel like an independent person up till recently I was living with my parents and just now am learning to live on my own. I wanted this to be sooner but due to my own lack of initiative and financial struggles I was not able to.I have been addicted to pornography and videogames ever since I was a teen. Just now I am trying to fix these issues. But its hard man... really hard after 15 years of constant use. Makes me feel disgusting. Full of hatred. But at any inconvinience or struggle I immediately resort to these two things.Lately I have been suffering from mood swings from manic anger and anxiety to relative peace serenity and reflection. Within the same hour even. I have also seemed to garner small panic attacks at the most ridiculous and inconsequential things that happen to me. I talk to myself. Alot. Alot alot over the years. For about a couple years now this self talk has turnt more negative over time. Insulting my own capability and intelligence at any mistake.There have also been times...in which I contemplated suicide... but not seriously. Just the idea of ending it all has crossed my mind.I dont really know why I wrote this. I guess I also have been feeling lonely.,Depression
38151,nobody would care if i wa dead i don t think my family would even react i starved myself and fasted everyday and looked sick and no one even noticed or remembers,Depression
11073,Sometimes I think it would be better if I did not exist. All traces of my existence erased nobody would suffer or remember me. That would be perfect bc I do not want to die or live either or feel pain but I want to take the weight of living off my back peacefully. Life is not worth all the sadness I feel when I start thinking about how I am miserable. There are times where I am feeling good and think Life is good after all. I want to live like this a little longer I want to live but this happiness does not last forever and I start overthinking againI also feel guilty for not wanting to live bc my family is wonderful and I have everything I want. I do not think I have the right to be sad about my life bc I definitively could be worse. I live normally I am not really sad or gloomy most of my days it is just that I am tired and empty. I go to a good school but now I hate studying I do not want to study more in college and I do not want to work after that but I will do it because I have to. If I am going to be forced by life to choose what to do for the rest of it then so be it. I do not have a career I would like to follow so I will just pick the one I hate least. Whatever I am just a lazy mf that does not want to deal with hardshipsI'm young so maybe I will feel better someday. Perhaps one day I will laugh at how I was stupid as a teenager that complained about everything and acted like they were depressed but until then I will just keep living i guess I am tired of life but I do not want to die,Depression
22826,I have been enough times on the bottom to know the path out. But each time I feel more like not wanting to. I am old there is nothing I have not tried even plan sounds like already tried. The sad thing is that I know I will get up. And I know I will get down... This is hell not eternal pain but just enough to almost kill you but enough peace so you can wish for more.I wonder how many tries I can do it... How to cope with not wanting to cope...,Depression
22309,I will not be remembered for anything and Ill die as nothing ,Depression

48117,I dont enjoy being awake or alive I find it tedious wake up with nothing to do no reason to be alive all the goals seem meaningless. Whats the point of going to bed if I just wake up again to feel the same empty sometimes I dont even wish for a gf or anything of the sort just someone to talk to I find them and three things happen I either push them away because Im not good at anything else they loose interest or just leave but almost every time I fuck shit up.,Depression
26407,Quitting setraline Zoloft?Hi i originally started taking sertraline 50mg in February 2020 due to a massive depressive period in my life while also experiencing extreme panic attacks. The sertraline bought me out of the depression some what and I was back to a baseline although not back to my normal self just to a kind of numbish baseline however still better than being majorly depressed. I upped my does to 100mg about 6 monhs ago as I again started to feel low again. However the past few months I have really tried to help my mental health and feel I have quite a good grip on it and feel a lot more stable however still slightly numb dur to the sertraline. This past weekend I took a dose of 100mg at 9pm on Friday night i ran out of my pills and could not get anymore until this morning Monday morning. I still have not taken another dose but I am not sure what to do now as I have decided I want to discontinue taking them. Shall i cut my pills and take 50mg for a week then 25mg. I am starting to feel like my happy unnumb self again after not taking them for a few days so what do you recommend I do? Thankyou Quitting sertraline Zoloft?,Depression

25504,Idk how to start this but I am 19 and I have been depressed since about 1415. I thought it was just a phase but I got a plumbing job which is what I went college for and wanted to do since I left school and the depression never went away they ended up letting me go of the job which did not help. My whole family knows about my depression but they do not know how bad it is should I tell them or try and figure it out on my own? I am also in the process of also quitting weed how much will this help my depression? The doctors have tried putting me on anti depressants but I said no should I take them? Sorry for all the questions. Help????? I have no idea what to do,Depression

10749,I am 22M living in a Mumbai India . I come from a well to do family with loving and supportive parents but now everytime I con only think about how I failed them. They never forced me do anything and never pressurised me to perform great in school. I did not have a bad social life either there was no bullying in my school I had good at social interactions with my peers and teachers and had a great rapo with them. My father came from nothing and achieved everything himself. I feel a pressure to out do him but nobody is telling me to do so. I have screwed up my life academically I never had to work hard to achieve anything I was good at sports and academics but slowly as competition started to increase i gave up on things and retreated. I started consoling myself that somehow I am destined to be sucessful and I started to belive it. Everytime I sleep I hope I do not wake up tomorrow or if I do wake up I wake up when i was 13 yrs old so I can re do my life with the current wisdom. Everytime my family goes out on vacation I hope they do not come back die so I can have an excuse for the failure I will become in future. The only reason I am not killing my self is because I do not want my parents to suffer due to me as they did everything right and provided everything for me. I hope everybody forgets about my existence just so I can just leave. I am lost I do not know what is ahead,Depression
17071,I just turned 38 and did 100 miles on my bike on my birthday. It was the 2nd time I have done it I did it once last year I broke my record from last year by 2 hours I was not sore at all after. I am 9 years sober I have been lifting weights at home for 7 off those years. I look like Jean Claude Van Dam. People hear this and think I am fit and active and have friends. Truth is I feel more and more isolated the harder I work. I just lost a relationship because she was a drinker and would ditch me to drink with her friends. My friends have all drifted away and nobody invites me out because I am sober. I am not a fitness freak I smoke 3 packs of cigarettes a day if I have the money. I do not fit in with cyclists I go at my own pace in gym shorts and tennis shoes. I do not go to the gym because I wreak like cigarettes. I am a jacked lonely crazy person that cannot get help. I have visible abs for the first time in my life because I have been going on 7day fasts playing with the idea of starving myself to death. Christmas 2020 I put a Facebook post up and shoveled 4 complete strangers driveways because. With the way I pushed myself with drugs and alcohol and with the way I am pushing myself with fitnessI feel like I cannot die. I am a beast. I have been horribly depressed most of my life and just had a huge life falling out panic attack. All I want is to die before I hate myself more. I am a 38 year old man and in the best shape of my life due to crippling depression,Depression
8065,I put this together while sobbing so hard I almost made myself vomit last night. I had a pounding headache had to hold my breath so my parents would not hear me crying.I have been in love with her since 2018. Was rejected and ghosted in 2020. I cry constantly and have been grieving every day for 3 years. I have never hd a girlfriend before and I am 25. The pain from never being able to be with her has contributed to my decision to kill myself I have already attempted but failed to hang myself a few times. Its something I have to cope with every day. Its a sickness that never goes away. Its a pain that is not just emotional but physical. Again I have been dealing with this every single day since fall of 2018.It reads.Dear KI wish you knew how special you are to me. I wish you knew you how happy I would be if we were together. But I know that would not make you happy. So I have to let you be happy. That is what I want because I love you so much.I wish you knew how happy you make me. I wish you knew how full of love my heart is for you. I wish I could hold you in my arms and protect you so that no one could hurt you.When I was young I learned the word for always in French toujours. It always sounded like a beautiful graceful yet heavy word to me. Something about how it sounds. It sounds melancholy sentimental but genuine and strong.you will always be in my heart. Toujours. Always. you will always be in my heart. I promise.I love you so much. I have written a few suicide notes I am going to send to a few different people when I do it. This one is going to the girl I am in love with.,Depression
38314,it just hit me sadness is everywhere even when im happy it feel like im drowning in sadness,Depression
11557,Its been so frustrating trying to find mental help. I am going through a divorce and it seems that all the issues I swept under the rug for years in regards to my marriage and my tendency to play dead have all come up to haunt me. I am trying to be a good mother and I have been but anything that is not urgent or does not have to do with my kids I tend to ignore. I was always the primary and only care provider for our boys but I realize that I need help to become whole once and for all. Please help if you can. Help! I need a psychiatrist but seems like they are all booked!,Depression
27059,This is just a rant of a random internet stranger that cannot even speak English I was diagnosed with depression couple years ago or so I was on medication tried few which did not work and I stuck into one which I have given up on aswell.. I kind of knew I was depressed before I was diagnosed and even after that I denied it for the longest time I guess first step to healing is accepting that I am not ok well here I am couple years later now I know I am depressed but I do not feel like I have the right to be depressedSomeone once told me that depression was like a dark hound following you around keeping you down and standing on top of you not letting go at first I looked at my depression the same way only to realize that my depression is not a hound its always changing.. Sometimes my depression is the entire room or the building and I sink into it with no way out and at times its a tiny ball that I can throw away for a moment only for it to creep back larger than ever.. It used to be better for me I could move to different city and it felt like the depression was behind for while but it always caught upto me and always getting its hold on me.. Now my depression is my entire home and even if I try to escape it follows me coats me into armour that protects me from every good feeling every little bit of hope and it keeps me locked in tight squishes me to the husk I have become..Today I tried to break the armour I paid off the loans I had and went to drive on this road next to the ocean to see if I could sneak away into the darkness of the sea with my car and end it all. I only ended up stopping at the bus stop crying there wondering what the hell am I going to do with my life stuck in a limbo being miserable living or creating misery by dying..So I am just here.. lost and afraid.. I do not have the heart to tell anyone how bad I am really doing I do not even think anyone is going to read any of this and I am more of ranting into the darkness to feel atleast something Depressed lost and afraid,Depression
22036,I have fucking had enough of all this shit I am so close to killing myself,Depression
23269,Man in fucking tired. I laugh but I cannot breathe I cannot think I cannot help but cry for hours in my room. I cannot stand this family anymore I just want to kill myself and I have tried before but I cannot even fucking do that right for fuck sake. I am tired i really am of no one fucking listening to me of no one understanding me WELL FUCK THE UNDERSTANDING PART. At least listen but nope. My head feels numb from the number of times I hit it against the wall how the fuck have I survived 15 years in this house I do not know. Someone probably has it so much worse then me that I cannot even imagine but who the fuck cares about how they have it. I want someone to care about how I have it I want someone to listen to me scream for hours on end about how fucked up everything is. I want someone to agree with me and not contradict the first fucking sentence that comes out of my mouth. I am straying away from my belief in God everyday no matter how hard I try I cannot fulfil any wish of mine I cannot do anything I put my mind to...well anymore at least I cannot think straight I cannot breathe. Seeing my mother trying to keep our family together is just rough man in tired of seeing her be abused by my dad physically for 7 or 8 years of my life and now mentally. I hate him I would shoot him if someone gave me a gun without hesitating. I hate my sister she is a little devil and I mean that literally she is the reason for so many problems in my house I do not want to live anymore I am tired of fucking hearing the same god fucking damned phrase it gets better with time. Fuck. Time. it is bullshit god favours the bold more like god favours the rich and famous. I do not want to do this anymore I am not scared of death or what is after it. I know a very pleasant hell awaits me but I am not scared for some reason. I am not able to stop myself from crying sometimes I cannot hold back emotions. I just want to hug someone for so long that I fall asleep. I want to talk about how I do not want to live and I do not want constructive criticism I just want you to listen I just want someone to listen. I give up cus there is no one I know like that. I give up cus I do not know where my life is headed I give up of hearing comparisons of me to other children of my age and how they score really well I give up of my parents assuming that the games I play and the people I talk to behind their back are the reason for my anger I give up of this motherfucking bullshit of a life. I give up. Thank you for reading. Man I am tired,Depression
20952,It feels like I am being punished for having issues that I do not know how to deal with. What more can I do? I already hit rock fucking bottom and somehow things get even worse. And I never realized how much no one gave a fuck about me but it is all very obvious now. My family is living happy since they do not have to worry about because I am such a burden and all I do is get in the way of them trying to live their life even though I am so unproblematic that I choose to suffer in silence so I do not bother anybody. I hate that I am probably going to end up doing something that I will regret but I have been wronged too many times. I hate my family so much and I just need some kind of retribution. I want them to feel as hopeless and helpless as I feel right now. I hate it here.,Depression
20797,There is no point being alive when you got no one to live for and you hate yourself. I have been mentally abused most of my life and no one seemed to care not even my best friend. My parents do not love me. They pretend like they do but every single day i get assured that I am an unloved failure. I do not want to physically hurt myself anymore i want to finally end my miserable life. No one would mourn me anyway. No one would even notice. One person that actually tried to help me said that if i have not killed myself yet even though i wanted to do it for a long time that means I am strong. Now i know it does not means I am strong. It means I am a fucking coward. I just want to do it,Depression
22578,I hate looking in the mirror so much. I do not really know why. I do not exactly like how I look but I do not think I am ugly either. But every time I look in the mirror everything is so off. I do not like what I see. It just feels wrong. it is gotten to the point where I actively close my eyes or look away from mirrors. I literally turn the lights off when I have to brush my teeth and stuff. I hate looking in the mirror,Depression
21802,Delete your apps turn your phone off give yourself 510 minutes of silence. Remember who you are ground yourself focus on your body and breathing. The mind can be overwhelming its difficult to make sense and piece together every aspect of your life. Noise surrounds us in many forms distractions people work media. Its okay to switch it off and remind yourself of how real you are and what you have been through. Everything is going to be okay take it one small step at a time. Some advice for anyone having a bad episode.,Depression
13917,I do not know why I am typing this I just have no where to turn I feel as though I have truly reached the end of what I can take. I have absolutely no reason to feel depressed but here I am struggling every fucking day. Its getting harder and harder to put on my social self I cannot take trying to act okay but I feel as though if I let how then I am just being a drain on everyone else they all have their own problems why should I also put the worry of me on their list as well. But I cannot go on like this. I have considered just ending it but for one I do not have the money for a funeral and I could not expect my family to pay for that as well and too I can only imagine how much of a toll it would take on other people like my family and friends and its not at all fair for them to have to deal with that but I cannot imagine having to deal with feeling like this going on with life. I have tried therapy and different types of anti depressants but nothing works I just do not know what to do anymore and I feel as though I just needed to vent this all out. But even this posting on a page about depression on a throw away account feels as though I am just seeking attention I do not know what to do anymore At the end of my line,Depression
22494,I have had a rough few months but these last few weeks have been almost nonstop with this feeling. I put my heart and soul into every person I talk to. I put as much as I can into every interaction I have but sometimes that passion manifests into babbling or talking about too much because of my ADHD. I would do anything for the people I love and I do that. But when I look around its almost like constantly waiting for someone to return the favor. I seem like a background character to everyone while I know some of my friends have people very central to their lives but those people are never me. I just am really at a bit of my own ropes end. I want to ask for help but do not want to have someone roll their eyes and say again? and its getting to me. I feel quite useless unloved and problematic.,Depression
20976,I finally decided to move out and go low contact no contact with my narcissistic mother. However that means I will not be able to see my previous boys as often anymore. I am heartbroken over it. My sweet puppies I spent everyday with them now I do not even know when the next time Ill see them is. Not only that the words that my mom said to me and how she treated me like I am not her daughter and just some random person really hurt me. My mom was very important to me and it hurts to have to do this so I can be better. I have the rest of my family but I do not want to bother them more than I have. I feel even worse now and even more lonely because I do not even have my own mother to turn to or my sweet dogs to cuddle with anymore. I know with how she is she is going to make me the enemy and say that I am the insane one because I admitted to her that I have attempted 3 times. I have forgiven her for so long. I do not think I am even capable of letting her come back into my life ever again unless she really straightens up. My ma,Depression
7090,I hate being alive. Every minute of everyday is just filled with pain and anguish. Why must we be forced to stay in a world that some of us do not see any hope or any type of future in? I am honestly at the end of my rope and there is nothing I can do to get myself out of this hole. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up because living is just a nightmare. there is no point,Depression
20475,cooking everyday has not been easy for lately. I just have intrusive thoughts when I am cooking. Why am I cooking and feeding myself everyday if I am just going to be depressed? go kill yourself.So I just cook one meal and eat like instant type of food for the rest of the day. I have heard some ppl cook their entire week of meal in one go but I feel like the food will go bad after 34days. Does anyone have cooking hacks?,Depression
15688,everytime i force myself to hang out with them i have no energy to act happy or energetic. I am making them sad disappointed tired and worried about me. i feel an urge to cut them off but i know i should not i have done it way too many times before and regreted it bad. I am draining them. they propably feel obligated to keep in contact with me because 'that is what friends do'. uggghhhh i hate depression. disappointing my friends,Depression
38172,i m failing out of college right now because i can t fucking focus every time i try to do my work i feel so restless and irritable i get hit with this stupid melancholy feeling for no good reason and it make me feel like doing nothing but lay in bed until i die of starvation but dying is too painful for a number of reason so i really have no easy way out hell i don t even have an out that seems reasonably doable i feel so trapped i want to talk to my loved one and tell them i m dying over here metaphorically but it feel impossible to tell them without something awful happening help,Depression
20418,it is pretty hard to explain I do not know entirely where to begin. But I will sum up my life in the past 3 years.I lived in one place for most of my life one day when I was 14 we had to move due to rent raising where I lived.I have only ever lived with my Dad I have never had a mom figure in my life and my mom abused me we could never find a place to move that satisfied my Dad the first place we moved to I did okay and was happy but after that for 3 years I moved to at least 6 different places. 6 different schools I absolutely hated it. I have been severely depressed ever since then I started anti depressants and they just fucked me up.Now I cannot distinguish reality and actually see what the fuck I am doing wrong to be so miserable.I honestly am starting to think suicide might be a better option here... I could slit my veins and bleed out and life would just fade away. what is my problem?,Depression
38034,i didn t do the best in school i doubt i ll have any success i hate blaming it on other thing but i wa homeless for a little while and constantly on the edge of being homeless and i knew it i wa physically abused and have ptsd because of it i ve struggled with substance abuse i m just feeling like i ve already messed up and i don t even have good memory of my childhood i don t know what to do i m only 9 and i m just over it all i don t see it getting better im closed off from my friend and family i barely see them im just so lost mentally,Depression
14364,I get advice all the time. They really do not get I am just not meant to be happy though. I let them give the advice usually and say thank you because they think I am just being an annoying pessimistic depressed ass if I reply saying that did not work or will not work for me. I have done A huge majority of advice people have said and I am not happy. Like therapy? Did it. medications? Did it. go outside and meet good people? Did it.working out? did it got fit still depressed.Quit my addictions like video games and porn? Did it. get a girlfriend? Did it. The list goes on and on.I am the very definition of a lost because. I laugh because these advices would work on the average person probably 99 percent of the population but for me my brain is so utterly fucked. Which nobody will really understand unless they had it. I was cursed with this shit. I am starting to find it funny when people give me advice for my depression now,Depression
15371,I am having many family problems and living situation problem and I just do not know what to do anymore. I am having many sad thoughts about just hating life and wishing it would all end.While I have said I would never end my life with how much I have been hating life I wish it would just end. I do not know anymore Very unhappy with life,Depression
26532,How life kind of has a end all button that you can press at anytime. I am starting to stare at that button and I do not want too. it is funny,Depression
19181,I am so fucking tired of being me I hate myself so fucking much. I am so useless to everyone. I just wish I was good for something. I came do anything besides be a mess and a burden to everything and everybody around me. cannot start a conversation cannot keep a conversation not funny not interesting cannot clean my room cannot look after my pets cannot look after myself cannot cook cannot clean cannot work I just cannot be fucking useful. I really wish assisted suicide was legal. Fuck everything,Depression
48281,Jobless depressed unmotivated 26 year old loser Im a 26 year old woman still living at home with mom and step dad. I live in the outskirts of Los Angeles so its not like Im in the most affordable of areas but ya I went to school got 2 associates degrees and then just dropped out after that. I havent really done anything since just hopped around from job to job up until recently where I went through another horrible depressive episode and missed a few days of work and for the first time in my life got FIRED! I deserved it but wow has it made me realize how not normal I really am. Ive been depressed and horrible anxious since I can remember and its gotten in the way of everything and everyone my entire life i guess my question here is what should I start doing with my life? I feel as though I want a fresh start. Ive been sitting here for the past week and I cant for the life of me figure out what to do. All I know is I can not work another customer service job I hate them so much. Please give suggestions on job paths for people like me. Thank you!!!,Depression
26559,I have no motivation to do anything... like anything hobbies do not interest me as they did before. I used to like playing video games but now I try and play for like 30 mins and it gets boring when I used to play for a few hours years ago. I used to play basketball but I do not have the same interest anymore... I can play it for probably 30 mins and then it also gets boring when I used to play hours like a few years ago. I have online businesses that I want to start but its impossible to do because I literally have no motivation to start it I have started other online ventures in the past but now I have no motivation.I literally wake up go on my PC and I guess browse the internet for hours. Time goes by fast as fuck even though I do not do anything. Time goes by fast even when not on my PC like I guess the days go by fast and it feels like I do not have time to do anything... even though I am not doing anything. I forget so much and I do not even remember what happened in the few weeks or remember stuff. I want to do stuff because it feels like I am wasting my time doing nothing. Its been like this for the past 2 years and months go by and I have nothing accomplished. It feels like this year started a few months ago yet we are already half way through the year its scary and I do not know what to do. Motivation,Depression
18972,We had a night out in town and I told her how much I like her and asked if she still felt anything towards me. That ship has sailed. she said.I will not even be able to look at her after this. I have a class with her tomorrow and we are supposed to go to a show the day after. Fuck. Forget both of those.There goes the closest friend I have ever had. I know all my other friends through her so I can write them off too. Two years down the drain. I will have nobody left.Why would I ever fall in love? I know I am unlovable. This'll be the first and last time I ever do. I should have left things the way they were. Let it continue eating me up inside. Anything is better than this.And I would been doing so well too. Finally got on top of my mental health for the beginning of a new college semester after the previous one being a travesty. Shame.Here come the destructive thoughts. Here we go again. I am done for. My best friend turned me down,Depression

19500,I feel like the people that I love most in my life do not need me or want me. I feel so alone. I am exhausted from the stress and I do not feel like I can talk to anybody about it because Ill be a burden by talking about myself and my feelings. I feel that the ones who mean the most to me can manage and do not need me. Nobody gives a shit if I am really okay or not. As long as I look it and get out of bed and go to work then I must be fine. This loneliness really really sucks. I hate crying and I really need a hug. Just feel like nobody gives a shit about me,Depression

13377,To start I am here because of relationship anxiety. I had posted recently about having immense anxiety about a girl I barely knew. Awesome girl. Very grounded very sweet. But for some odd reason chemistry somewhere down the way I had become infatuated rather quick. And then a certain unease crept in that felt like I was screwing up somewhere. within moments I automatically jumped to very negative affirmations that swirled in my head day and night for the past two weeks. The ones that stick out you are going to fuck this up you are not normal she will find out your issues and dip from yo crazy ass!!Somewhere down the way I deeply pondered at the last part. Life looking back was rather well....Childhood!!I had parents who had issues in their relationship on their own let own their own individual demons. I acknowledge that they always did their best to make sure we were fed and had a roof over our heads. But a lot of things I felt I had to teach myself on my own. In the beginning life was okay but after awhile it got tough for my parents way back. and certain choices were made then that led to exodus from Hawaii to the mainland. Things were the best we could make but they were not ideal. At some point in time we slept in a car as a family.We never stayed in one place for longer than a year. always constantly moving since I was a kid it practically never ended until I had gotten a place of my own. It did not with my parents anger issues mother's narcissism and my father's drinking and abuse. Still through it all they stuck it out for us but I wonder sometimes if that was a good idea...When both of my younger siblings were diagnosed with autism both of my parents had gotten distant from me it felt. I completely understand and a lot of it I give myself shit for it. But also my younger siblings have been sheltered too much as well. It was hard then as a kid to tell them that there was a difference between compromising and spoiling. We gave them no structure or guidance. After awhile I was left with most of responsibilities of watching and raising my younger siblings which are the memories I enjoy most in my life. Looking back now it was not all bad.The level of abuse between my parents ruined a lot of opportunities for us. Always hurting themselves us our possessions fighting relocating separating getting back together again rinse and repeat. Lived through toxic before I knew what that meant. Ran away for the first time when I was 11 and went across the county almost. It became clockwork. because of the constant moving I could never maintain friendships. And on top of that I was scared to bring friends around. To some degree it got to a point where we filed a false domestic violence report on my father He actually was getting his shit together at the time to get into a farm program and avoid sleeping on the street. Also a good time learned Martial arts did gardening. Another good time.Parents had gotten back together at some point in time before High School. Life was good for a bit stable. Then the issues arose. I was having issues with my parents then and went out and hung out with the wrong crowd was partying and drinking all the time even skipping school. I graduated but barely. My graduation on the other hand was finding out my mother was gambling addict and also was in part to ruining a lot of our prospects in life.I do not want to hold onto any of this against my parents. Now they are still trying their best to survive and they have changed over the years. But lately this surfaced too and I have not felt well when I talked to my mother about this. She did not know what to say and I began to be frustrated about it but I realize now that she was not prepared to handle the issues I was going through and she was trying her best. Its still upsetting when she does not remember anything she has done wrong. But I need to move on I love my mother and I only have one. No matter how batshit crazy she is.I love my dad we are okay we hang out have lunch every once in awhile and he is conscious of his actions. But he still has a lot of work to do. But I am proud of how far he is come. I love you Dad.Adulthood!!! the super condensed versionRight after graduation was a shitshow. Lost the place me and pops split. ended up in a shelter for a year and a half. Dad came here from a different country under extreme circumstances I do not want to get into but frankly he was prepared for life as much as I was. Went to community college while homeless. Got an apartment with other guys my age from the shelter. Then realized alcoholism was genetic. Fucked off my responsibilities. Split. Went upstate to stay with my mother. At the time I realized she was up to same tricks which led to a lot of fights between us and eventually she stole from me and kicked me out. stayed with a girl next door first relationship then left me for the father of her baby I was still fucking off my responsibilities then and subsequently back on the street.moved around from place to place. Met another girl fell in love but she had major depressive disorder and schizo. after a year the relationship took a turn for the worst. She began to be emotionally abusive and always kicked me out. I did my best but at the end of the day we have come to terms that she never actually loved me. She went into another relationship a couple weeks later. But I fell hard.Interesting part COVIDI moved back the other side of the state to stay with my dad. The place he had for me was a clean and sober house ran by a slumlord. Then COVID hit the states. I was quarantined in a horrible place post breakup living with my dad who was emotionally abusive. I could not handle it. I got my shit together got a job at the hospital and got my own apartment!!!NOW....Been doing everything I needed to. Kept up with bills work out every day eating healthy drinking less. Then I met this girl. Same birthday independent very grounded. And now everything came back. Now my anxiety is becoming debilitating in certain areas. I am becoming more irritable although a lot of that is from the shortcomings of the healthcare industry. But if this is going to become a thing I need in dealing with this anxious attachment style. I have pushed away my remaining friends because of my last relationship and I am starting to push everyone else away right now. Either way if you made this far thanks for taking the time. I know I am better than this and I know I can be better than this. I just wish I did not mess this up with her just to learn. Frankly I just wish things like this did not happen just for a learning lesson. Feels like the purpose of my life is just to be an example. do not be like this guy. I just want to be happy and honest. I try to do the right thing in anything I do and I try to help people as much as I can. But why I cannot be happy or trust other people? Why cannot I just be happy?Wishing I could time travel now.....ampx200BTry your best because everything else is easy. Always do the right thing. Goodwill will always be paid forward. Finding closure in my crazy life To pursue true happiness within myself,Depression
37749,hi idk if anyone will comment and thats okay i just need to talk or something since i m just so tired of my thought and just this worthless feeling i have all the time dealing with depression is no joke and being in a small town suck more since there not many resource or help for me i ve gotten a little help here and there but have just fallen back to being in my room isolating myself i have suicidal thought quite often and worry i might act on them not soon mind you just scared of myself i think of plan on how i could do it i ve written letter directed towards family member and friend before though i keep them to myself i ve self harmed before but haven t for quite sometime though i worry i may resort to that again i really just want help but i have no idea how i can even get it anyhow i thank anyone for reading if you did i don t have a lot of hope left but i guess i m still alive so yeah,Depression
15277,I have stopped taking my antidepressants. They made me completely numb and I never felt any emotion at all while I was on them. Since I stopped all the emotions of the past started flooding back and now I do realise why I started taking them in the first place. I am feeling all these negative emotions again and I started to see the world very negatively too. Everything bad that happens to me even if it is out of anybody's control I take it personally. For example when somebody accidentally bumps into me they do it because they hate me and think I am ugly. When I drop a pen or whatever it is because I am useless and I cannot do anything right. Every small thing hurts me way too much. I have been trying to talk to my bf about it. But he struggles mentally too and somehow he always finds a way to turn the tables around and make me comfort him even when I need it the most at that time. I tell him how bad I feel and he apologises for being a bad bf because he could not keep me happy. that is not true at all he is not a bad bf because he could not keep me happy and it hurts me that he thinks so. I have one other friend I do trust enough to tell but I feel like I will be a bother to her. I did tell her a few times and she did listen and even helped me calm down but I do not want to bother her too much. My mom and brother do not understand me at all my brother makes fun of me and my scars and threatens to beat me so badly that I will have to go to the hospital and my mom just does not understand which makes her frustrated and makes her yell at me. I feel like everybody is walking over me. it is a chaos in my mind and I cannot get the peace back. But I also do not want to feel like a robot again. I do not want to go back on antidepressants.This was just a rant I just needed to get it off my chest Feeling lonely and nobody listens,Depression

25602,I really need someone to talk to. I do not know what to do. I feel alone right now. I am scared shitless. I am waiting for a call from my doctors office I am a few hours to see what the tumor is after I had a CT scan yesterday. There is a possibility that it could be cancerous. Both of my parents have had cancer in their 40s so I am worried. I am a year old 20 girl and my doctor just found a tumor,Depression

7194,From year to year it gets worse medications will not help me anymore. What is called therapy here is actually an annual visit to the doctor for a new prescription Cheer up find a job. Great advice for a person who cannot leave the house and more than once passed out from anxiety when buying groceries. I am too old and worthless to try any further. I want it to be over. I will never be okay,Depression
20464,I am thinking of getting escort for the first time but I am still a little hesitant. I was hoping to hear some of your experiences if it was worth it or not how to set it uppay etc.Ideally I would like to put it on a credit card since I do not have that much cash. Is that even an option? Like would they charge it as some massage service and allow me to pay with card? Or would it be cash only? Has anyone here hired an escort? Was it worth it?,Depression
14366,i just do not want to wake up. i do not even want to sleep. nothing good is coming. I am alone I am desperate nothing feels real anymore. I am already kept pushing so long just for it to fall apart over and over I am so tired i do not want to keep on i just wwnt to stop but i keep moving and working and trying to talk to people and its led to this. nothing I am empty but for reget and shame about who i am what i want and all i have not done. i do not see a reason to push on i do not have anything to look forward to just another day where I am not enough for anyone not even myself. i do not see a difference between tomarrow yesterday or the day before its all the same feeling i want it to end. i want to be able to tell myself i did enough i held out long enough that its ok to just give in but i always feel like tomorrow could be the day something changes if i just push a bit more i can be happy. i honestly hate it. i just want to stop I just want to stop,Depression
38994,convinced myself when i take it in they will be annoyed at me and judge me for it not working nothing physically broken that i can see really just need someone to tell me not to overthink it if you re retail yourself that s a bonus,Depression
15006,I have been really struggling this past year with sadness. It started with a bad break up and not getting into the college I wanted. I know this shit sound super stupid and like a small deal but it has affected me really hard. I started going on week long benders of drinking to the point I spend hours recovering from the hangover. My relationship with family is a mess my mom and I do not talk a lot and my dad has expressed his disappointment in me. My best friend has moved to another country and the ones that stayed are busy and I do not keep in touch with them as much as I would want to. I have tried reaching out to many people but I just do not feel comfortable disclosing my feelings to people I know. Man I know this shit has to end but I just feel so shitty every time a wake up and before I sleep. I have gotten really out of shape and gained around 30 pounds this last year and lost all my motivation to work out. Hope to find my rhythm soon and get better but its been really difficult Very lost,Depression
18844,I do not like my life I do not like society I do not like the future that is awaiting us and I do not want to live anymore. If I did not have family I would kill myself but since I know they would blame themselves for the rest of their lives I sadly do not feel the freedom to do that. Over the last years I have been increasingly isolating myself from the world often not answering phone callstexts etc. because I just do not see the point in doing anything if at the core of my beliefs I do not see the point in living. Some facts about me I am male 29 pretty healthy have a university degree get by fincancially live in one of the best places in the world and had a decent childhoodupbringing. My feelings are not an emotional reaction but rather a rational conclusion formed over the years.I really do not want to go to therapy I have tried it twice. It makes me feel like this life is even more useless if I need to work my ass off just to be able to afford therapy so that they can ask me fancy questions tell me to meditate or to medicate so everything might get a little bit more bearable.I just do not want to live! But I also do not want to be the asshole that messes up other lives by killing myself. What can I do? I just do not want to live! But I also do not want to be the asshole that messes up other lives by killing myself. What can I do?,Depression
17547,So I just had a mental breakdown after a lot of stress and pain. I know this will not last but I feel much better Having a mental breakdown really helps sometimes.,Depression
9375,Reaching out was tough I needed a year of I can handle it on my own amp it is not bad enough to admit that I cannot handle it. So I went to my doc got a prescription for therapy even adjusted in accordance with my endocrinologist my HRT dosage. I had counselling interviews with a two therapists which could not take me as their patient though and I got an assumed diagnose for an anxiety and depressive disorder as well as an adjustment disorder. After asking many therapists and being denied as a patient I give up now. I still got a couple of suitable therapists from one of the counselling interviews but I got no strenght or motivation to check them out partly because I do not think my situation will ever improve even though I wish I had answers.I am just too tired of facing this existance of suffering and loneliness where it does not seem to get better. Of course people always tell you that it gets better etc etc but I do not believe the phrases anymore. I got no hope left and wish this suffering would just end. I just hate myself other people and this never ending loneliness. Heck I am that much of a failure that I do not even manage to SH while wanting to yes everyone would say that is a good thing but it just makes me feel foolish.Meanwhile I am forced to endure this existence IF I HAVE TO STAY I WANT TO LIVE AND NOT SENSELESSLY EXIST!! I toture myself with checking out social media and making me feel even worse or remind me of my suffering while not being able to stop with this bad habit. exhalesJust release me from this suffering please ... Started trying to get help could not get any amp am now giving up while wishing to just dissolve,Depression

10610,Tw suicide mentionIm going to be honest I have been thinking about suicide lately I have been so alone lately And there are times where I feel like completely emptyAnd you might think that is just me being sadNoIts literally nothingIm not sure how to describe it as anything different its just nothingAnd sometimes I have just started crying for no real reason and I cannot stop crying I know that I am slowly losing everything because of this And I cannot tell anyone this because I know the second I do Ill be treated like some charity caseI do not want thatAll I want is to be okayIve said that in my letter to myself To at least be okayWhy cannot I be okayIts not like I fully want to feel happyOr have everything I ever wantedIs it so hard to ask God or the universe or whatever the hell is out there to be okay?If I cannot be okay can I at least feel something positive because I have not had that this past yearI just do not know what to do anymore at all and I really would like some guidance I am really empty,Depression
10671,Probably is not the right subreddit to post this in but I just want opinions.What should I do with myself?Should I enlist in the military?I know some people are automatically going to say yes but I want some honest opinions.Basically I am 23 years old and I feel completely lost in life. I am still living with my parents I am working as a janitor at a school I have a useless college degree I have never had a girlfriend or been on any dates. Even though I am young I just feel like I am already failing miserably. I frequently consider suicide as a serious solution. I was going to enlist in the military right out of high school. However I took four years of HS JROTC and absolutely hated it. My experience with ROTC ruined my view of the military and I decided not to join. Now here I am five years later and I am not sure what to do.Now here is my other issue. I have very bad anxiety. Like I live in a constant state of anxiety and I am pretty sure I have depression because I actively consider suicide frequently. I get stressed out very easily and I feel very stupid because I frequently misinterpret simple instructions which honestly might just be anxiety setting me off in the wrong direction but still. I am also not physically fit in any capacity I can hardly perform push ups. I only recently started considering enlisting again because some people have told me that joining the military helped them a lot with their lives and I am just wanting some honest opinions on if anyone thinks I should join or if I should figure something else out. What should I do in life?,Depression
24177,I am 34 weeks pregnant. I have started taking sertraline for my boarderline personality disorder they primarily wanted me taking it because I have manic depression as well and my doctors are concerned about post partum. Well today I had my pre admit for the hospital I have barely been on these for a week but they told me that my baby would likely experience withdrawal once born. I am not sure I want to put it through that but at the same time they are saying that the benefits for my well being outweigh the risk put on my baby. My SO says he supports me on whatever I choose to do and that he thinks it is best if I take them personally because my moods have been so all over. I constantly feel like I am drowning lately I know it is not just me it is my family they are inconsiderate and its getting to me. I really just need some TLC I need to feel like they care. It does not feel like they do I am simply here to make everything convenient for them and now I am in a position where they are taking more than I can give. I have had suicidal ideaology for the better part of my life since I can remember I have romanticized dying. Only because that means the pain would end. I sound dramatic but I had a very traumatic childhood and I have never had a chance to recover or the support I need. I am tired though this new doctor has narrowed it down he hit the nail on the head with his diagnosis I think which was boarderline personality disorder manic depression anxiety disorder as well as PTSD. Honestly it all makes sense my moods my behaviour everything. Now it is just figuring out how to stop it so I can be the best version of myself for my littles and not fuck them up. So the medication was where he wanted to start and then he referred me to a few different therapists one for DBT therapy and trauma groups and then just normal therapy. I am scared though I do not want to hurt my baby. But I am hurting. I guess I just needed to get it out I feel like a bad person for needing this shit I wish I could just be normal. Meds and baby.,Depression
14462,At both 16 and 24 today I am an unemployed virgin. At 16 no one would bat an eye.

Now I am pathetic,Depression
21308,My ultra toxic family made me much more suicidal than I am in last 3 years. I do not know what to do. I have no balls to leave home. I live in a 3rd world country and probably I will die in streets If I leave. They ruined my childhood and satill ruining my life. I could not do something which will make my happy until this day bcz of them. 20 empty years. I am trapped inside those walls and I know nobody's going to save me. Instead of living here trapped ending my life seems more logical for me. I have come to an end,Depression
7311,I have been laying in bed all day. i do not have the energy to eat and i have not done anything but stare at my phone for the last 12 hours. i do not really care about myself a whole lot and i cannot muster up the energy to climb out of this depressive spiral right now. i do not feel like i have anyone in real life to talk to about this. any advice would be appreciated. m19 feeling emotionally numb do not know what to do.,Depression
19694,I am sad again as always. Constantly being reminded about how I will never mean anything to anyone. I attach to too many people so easily. do not know if its because of me being an empath or if I am just desperate for love and attention. I want love. I really do. But at the same time I do not I do not want love. It terrifies me. I do not trust another soul to love me back the same way I love them. To care about me the way I do. It will always be me who gives more. No one can ever love me. I am not worthy of it. Ill never be enough. Not pretty. Not smart. Not skinny. Nothing. there is nothing to love about me. I do not even love myself. I do not even love myself.,Depression
47114,Life is depressing Im pretty sure this has been posted a million times here before. But I just feel like Im done with life and Im only 24 and no matter what it is Im doing Im either feeling anxious or depressed as they do come hand in hand. I dont enjoy hanging out with family or friends Id rather be alone but when Im alone and at home I feel useless and depressed. Im too tired to even explain in detail but Im sure you all know this feeling. And I do know the steps to get out of this rut but that effort needed is draining itself people that dont go through this are so lucky. Im just feeling numb and depressed and I dont wanna do anything about it.,Depression

15050,I feel like there is no good way of describing how I am feeling to people who do not get it. I have absolutely no desire to participate in normal life anymore. Any social event I have to participate in is almost 100 faked. Every small setback just makes me give up even more. I have to hold back tears almost all day every day. But I feel like I cannot call in sick to work because they will just call me lazy and emotional. So now it is a really bad headache or a migraine that sends me to my dark quiet bedroom for the rest of the night. People can relate to headaches and do not try and tell you to just stop having headaches. at this point I barely still give a shit about pleasing other people but I still do for now. Maybe if life gets a little worse I will be less afraid to just say it is taking everything in my power to just get out of bed every day. and not give two shits about whether they believe me or relate to me anymore. Just telling people it is a headache from now on.,Depression
14363,I have wanted one for a long time but I have not been able to get one because of my roommate's dog and how he never wanted one.A few days ago I was offered to take over a lease. I have been needing to move out of my current living arrangement because it is toxic and I finally have an opportunity to live on my own. This will be my first apartment living alone. I feel like being fully alone can be bad though so I would love to adopt a cat that could keep me some company. I think this will be good for me. I think I am going to adopt a cat,Depression

24767,So I have been a long time reader on here and I figured this would be the best place for help.So about four months ago I started feeling aloof I guess you would call it but I have been feeling worse and worse. All the things that used to really make me feel good now just kind of feel like chores. Never really feel like leaving my room. I am 28 this month and I am not sure if I am just feeling down or if depression is what I am experiencing. I have had periods like this in the past but I have been told there is no reason for me to be depressed and usually I take it on the chin and keep walking forward because that is what I am supposed to do. do not really have any real friends so any advice would be much appreciated I could use some perspective,Depression
7518,What are clear symptoms of depression in your opinion? At what point did you enroll in therapywould you recommend enrolling in therapy? What are symptoms of depression?,Depression
19398,I feel like the last four years were just a big scam. College did not give me any new prospects and it gave me 30000 in debt plus 60000 of parent plus loans for my immigrant mom who does not even know that she took out those loans becuse she cannot speak or read english.I have an awesome girlfriend but she lives in another country on the other side of the world and we have not met in person yet. I promised her that we would meet this summer but covid changed our plans. I need to find some entry level job so I can start paying off this massive loan but it just looks so hopeless. I am thinking of getting 2 jobs maybe one in retail and one at an Amazon warehouse but even then it would take me forever to pay them off. If I cannot live with or even visit my girlfriend then maybe I am not the right guy for her. At this point I am just a financial burden for my parents not to mention a massive dissapointment. I have two younger brothers and I feel like they will learn from my massive errors and do the right thing after high school. But I do not think there is any hope for me anymore. Just graduated college and feel like my life is reaching an expiration date,Depression
22999,This is the second time in a month where I just forgot to set my alarm. By the time I woke up I was already 40 min late and when I clocked in an hour and 20. I hate how I am so forgetful and cannot even remember basic shit. I am not going to be able to get over this and my day is wrecked. Over an hour late to work this morning,Depression
11985,I have read so many peoples experience on Reddit with depression and it always makes me feel whole again. Like oh that is it! This person was just lacking self esteem! that is my problem too If I study the six pillars Ill be back to normal. So I do and for a day or two I feel great. But the cycle always seems to start again. I am not even sure if its depression but I sure feel different these days. I am 18 and when I was sixteen I felt so on top of everything even looking back at texts I was smart funny clever and arrogant . I had hobbies and never avoided people. Now I am isolated and anxious around friends and coworkers. Constantly thinking how to say things what tone to use is this an appropriate answer to this persons question and incredibly frustrated at my lack of real connection with anybody. Even my cognitive function I feel has gotten weaker like a bon fire that has simmered down To a candle light. I started blaming the isolation with my family and now I think it was marijuana use. I hate going to my retail job my mind blanks so often in conversation and worst of all my boss is a nice to me for the wrong reasons. He thinks I have a learning disability. My questions s where do I get help? And does anyone think I needs medication I am fighting my dad because he does not think I need any meds and that I just have low self esteem? I think hes right about the self esteem but maybe there is more problems like adhd or depression? Confused and frustrated needed to rant.,Depression

25733,My depression is getting worse and I am feeling hopeless lost and down all the time and my family thinks I just want attention. It used to be only a few nights now it almost every night and day. I do not hang out with my friends any more and when I do I am forcing myself to have fun and laugh. I really need someone whenever I cry for help no one helps me. A cry for help not attention.,Depression

20746,I want to start college this fall I do not know if I will have the drive or focus to get through the days. What can I do? How do I find the strength to go to and stay in college?,Depression
19031,I cannot hold a job down longer than a month until my head starts really cracking down on my ass and I snap and cannot get out of bed until I get a phone call saying I am fired.I cannot go outside ever since I had a severe panic attack literally thought I was going to die that is extremely fun. So I am unable to go outside with chest pains and anxiety majority of the time.I cannot even interact with other people that is even worse since all I can do is talk to myself my GF and my mother. I cut off most of my family.It does not even matter at this point I am fucking 20 years old who cannot just work how everybody else does and function that way. I am not sure if my childhood trauma would play a part in this or not. I do not even have a therapist either I am not one for taking medication. I cannot work I cannot go outside and I cannot interact with other people.,Depression
22921,Throughout my life I have struggled with depression. it is always just been a constant thing simmering under the surface. it is ruined my life to be honest. I had so much trouble in school and now at 36 the reality of my life is hitting me so hard. I am 36 and I have never had a stable job. I do not have any friends and my family while kind to me I think they are done with me along with everyone else. My husband supports me and I am draining him. I know I am. I feel guilty about it every day but I cannot seem to figure out how to get better. I have been to therapy a few times and it only seems to make things worse especially the more they dig at my problems. I do not want to go to a psych ward because I am pretty sure that would only add to my problems. I do not see any other path to success or getting better right now and for the first time ever I wonder if I would be better off dead. it is frightening to feel this way... I would usually be able to tell myself something or focus on something else to get it to stop. But I dunno about this time. I do not know what to do right now. This is the first time in my life that I have genuinely felt like I would be better off dead.,Depression
17471,I feel like I have no destiny. Like I was never meant to be does anyone else have exact thoughts? Feeling purposeless,Depression

7303,I feel like I have always had one sided friendships. like I am always the one who puts in all the work. And it sucks because it used to hurt less. When I was a kid before I moved for the first time friendships were easy. My best friend lived a few houses down and wed have sleepovers all the time. we did not have phones so we would talk and hangout during recess and on the weekends. and then I moved. and I was the weird new kid. it took me three years to make friends. and just when I started to fit in we moved again. and again I was the weird new kid. I would somehow find my way into friend groups that were already established. but because they would known each other forever they never included me in anything. because I was not really one of them. I bounced around friend groups for 3 years. until I met the new weird girl. we bonded over how shitty moving was and we made fast friends. we are still best friends more than 10 years later. we made our own friend group and it was nice. but she graduated 2 years before I did. and the year after she left my friend group changed. we took in two freshman that seemed to hate me for no other reason than I was the defacto leader. they thought they were hot shit and gossiped and lied and turned my friends against me. except one. and I was... okay. I had other friends and spent time on the sidelines in their friend groups. but then they all graduated. or moved. and it was just me and a school full of people who either hated me or did not know I existed. I was facing senior year alone and with the worst schedule I had ever seen a senior have. so I dropped out. cut off all my hair. attended the local community college to get my GED. kept my head down mostly. did not really make friends. after I got my GED I kept taking classes. nothing in particular just general stuff. edged my way into more friend groups. again they never made plans with me. but I was used to it. I did my own thing. and I was ok. I had a job then. and a semi decent boyfriend. I wasted two years in college and never got enough credits to even really count as half a year. dropped out. lost all my school friends when I stopped going to school. worked and spent time with my boyfriend. life was good I had my best friend who hung out with me all the time a good job and a semi decent boyfriend. and then we broke up. and my parents moved. so I moved. in with a man twice my age in a state id never been to. and he went to work in Alaska. left me alone in a house with four animals to look after a job that gave me four hours a week and a freezer full of burritos. i made one friend that was a good friend. kept me company when I needed it. washed my dishes if I made him food. took me out places. he was probably the only reason I am still alive. then the man who is house I lived in came back. I somehow managed to get back with my ex in that time and I moved with my parents to another state id never been in. the friend who would saved me stopped texting. stopped responding. after six months of no friends and no job I moved back to my hometown to be with my boyfriend. who kicked me out in less than a month. so I lived with my sister. and her two kids husband and fil. slept on a cot in my niece's room. eventually broke up with my boyfriend. worked too many hours in a job that sucked and did not have time or money to make friends. in a desperate move I moved in with a new partner. to a different state. this one I would at least visited. I got a job. we had nice roommates. everything was nice. until my partner had a mental breakdown. moved out. left me alone where I could not afford the rent. so I moved across the country back to my parents. where I live still. I have been here for two years. no job. a wonderful boyfriend who loves me and one friend. that never reaches out if I do not reach out first. never wants to spend time with me unless I ask. and suddenly I am back in middle school. a depressed fuck with no real friends no motivation and a the biggest wish to have never existed in the first place. shitty friends are the worst. I do not even try anymore. I do not want to try anymore. I want to fade into the background until no one remembers I ever existed. If you are reading this know that I do not want to die. I do not want to stop living. my death would be too painful to people I care about. I would never do that to them. but if a genie came to me and gave me one wish I would ask to have never been born. obviously there is a lot more going on that fuels my depression but this is the most prevalent right now. Rant. Down in my feels tonight. it is a long one.,Depression
22147,I have not been at peace with myself for months now. I feel like there is a void in my life that nothing can ever fill. I go out with friends for movies and I will be happy for a moment or two and then I am hit with the sudden relaxation that moments like that do not last forever. The things I enjoy doing video games etc. are not as fun as used to be now. I am always in search of happiness and it is never enough. Then what does the universe possibly owe me? I am so bored and unmotivated each day and get out of bed at noon and accomplish nothing productive. The self loathing and hatred never stops too. I feel like an asshole all the time and I compulsively try to take care of others to deny it. Then am I not doing it just to feel better about myself? I am seen as an extrovert but really I am just afraid of being alone. And I cannot really open up to my friends without changing the topic. I feel ashamed whenever I do not feel okay because there are others that have it worse than me and I am very fortunate enough to be where I am now. Therefore I do not think I am depressed or there is anything seriously concerning about me. I have suicidal thoughts here and there and that is about it. I do not feel like I can turn to anyone so please tell me to get my shit together reddit. I have not been feeling okay.,Depression
13312,I am scared. I just need someone to explain what happens. What do they do? How do parents handle it? How are the antidepressants? Once you are diagnosed can you really recover? What questions do they ask....if its major what then? Will I be treated differently? Is it better undiagnosed? I do not like psychologists. I do not want to have sessions. I know I need help and I am probably far into the rut but I do not know what To do. What are the stages or what is the procedure of being diagnosed with depression?,Depression
37977,while i wait for my school counselor to give me an update on the whole online school therapy thing i wa convinced to check out a confidential free and text based crisis hotline it s apparently designed for teen like me who have noone in their life that they could talk to now for me personally my experience wa subpar i don t want to disrespect the volunteer work there but after the successful attempt one in the morning and one just hour earlier i felt like i wa just a number on a waiting list the system constantly kicked me out of the conversation and the one time i actually had a decent conversation it felt like they were trying to cast me aside a quick a possible a soon a i mentioned that music help me organize my thought at time they told me to just listen to music and the conversation closed immediately after maybe i m stupid or maybe it s just my anxiety and paranoia but they seemed annoyed i guess it would help to say what i wa expecting i wa thinking it would be a deep dive into why i feel the way i do but it wa more just a short session of giving me a metaphorical ice pack and sending me home with an old stale lollipop if i didn t feel worthless enough already then well a for the nd successful attempt it wa even shorter they asked me how i wa feeling they asked a question to confirm what i said i answered and then the very next message wa telling me that i must ve stepped away and that the conversation had been closed the automated reply also hit me with a stinger saying you matter it doesn t feel like it it doesn t help that i had to reply stop over and over because i kept getting auto reply from the bot needle to say i have le faith that online school therapy will even put a dent in how i feel tldr seeking help a many advise when situation like these crop up hasn t worked this time around and my already weak ability to see a good future for myself ha withered away a bit more,Depression
25064,Hey folks I was wondering if anyone else has experience with something I am dealing with. I am on escitalopram 20mg. Been on it for a while now but I am having crazy vivid dreams. Bizzare!!! Whenever I sleep I dream. Even naps. Every single night. I do not need movies I just got to sleep anyone else? Escitalopram,Depression
15516,I have such low self esteem I hate myself and I am stressed and depressed and tired all the time.My boyfriend is always angry and screaming at games or at work and that just makes me feel worse. I am afraid of him all the time even though he does not do anything to me or yell at me.Today somebody complemented my outfit at the grocery store and it felt really nice and I was so excited! I turned back around and started walking and accidentally hit my boyfriend in the ankle with the cart and he snapped at me in front of a few people and I apologized a million times but he was just cold and acted like I was not there while we were checking out and I just got so upset and I kept apologizing and I even told him he could yell at me if he wanted but all he said was I am not mad. Watch where you are going. And the way he said it only upset me more and I feel worthless and like a piece of shit again.I felt good for maybe a solid 10 seconds before being reminded of what a useless sack of shit I am again that I cannot even walk without fucking something up. Why am I so upset over something so stupid?? If it were the other way around I rationally know it is not a big deal but since I am the one who did it I feel like it is the end of the fucking world and he hates me and I am a worthless piece of garbage. I feel like I do not even sldeserve to be around normal people Settles I wish he would just scream at me or hit me or do something so I can just be punished for being a shitty piece of ahit bitch girlfriend. I hate myself so much I do not deserve anything good ever. I feel like I deserve to be punished any time I fuck up even a little and then maybe I will start fucking acting right. I deserve nothing good. The time iest things make me hate myself,Depression

9767,I am being kind of ghosted by 3 friends. I try to apologize for being bad at communicating but my apology might be too late? I worry about my day job every day. Did I make my bosses mad? That fear seems to never go away. I write when I get the time. I am still getting depressed but the depression seems to be moving slower than before. I am in a weird situation. I just needed to vent. Venting feeling weird,Depression
8457,I am 25F. I was diagnosed with depression at 12 and borderline personality disorder at 23. It comes and goes but when its bad its BAD. Things are not going amazing in my life at the moment but also not particularly bad either. But i feel like I am in a serious slump.I have tried therapy multiple times in the last 13 years multiple different therapists and approaches but it honestly has never done anything for me at all.I have been on SO many different medications throughout the years and finally am on one that helps more than the others but still not fully. Nobody in my family deals with any mood disorders so they are not very understanding when i do go through slumps so i feel like I am not taken seriously and no one truly understands how bad i feel.I also do not want to try therapy again for the simple fact that i cannot afford it. I make too much for Medicaid and even with good insurance i was paying almost 300 out of pocket twice a month just for therapy alone not including my general appointments for my medication.I really only have 3 people i can talk to. One being my boyfriend of 6 years who is supportive and as helpful as he can be but given the fact hes never struggled with it himself he does not really understand. The other is my best friend who is honestly not the greatest friend in general and i feel like i bother her when i talk to her. The last person is my sister but she picks and chooses when she wants to listenhelp.I hate burdening people with my issues and i feel that is all i do. But i also feel like I am going to lose my mind. do not really know what to do anymore,Depression
16286,Warning I am kind of just ranting to myself to collect my thoughts17m I do not understand it. Obviously I am in control but I constantly make stupid decisions and I do not understand why. I think I am just lazy and I want to feel like there is a reason besides myself that I keep fucking up. Its completely stupid shit like I do not do my homework because I do not know. I want to it would not be hard but I do not. So then I end up having a 32 ACT while having a 2.1 GPA. Another time I liked a girl and she liked me and I just ghosted her out of the blue because well I do not know. Did this to a friend of mine as well and I do not know why. Maybe I feel like I am not in control because I am a moron and do not ever actually TRY to take control of my life I feel like I am not the one in control,Depression
17668,Tomorrow is the only day off I have for the next two weeks so I am drinking as an excuse for the roller coaster of emotions I am going to have working 10 hours a day. I am an introvert so my only hobbies are video games manga anime and cute animals Working full time and coming home just to be lonely is the worst because I am usually uncomfortable with rl friends coworkers Would anyone like to talk? My depression is bad again,Depression
15933,I want so bad for something to go right. A happy life with friends and people who love me. Sometimes things are so unbelievably terrible that I start to wonder if religion is real and I died and went to hell. I think it would be something like this. I have not even seen a familiar face in over a month. Loneliness is killing me and nobody wants someone broken anymore. Things have been so bad throughout my life that I am starting to wonder if I was a terrible person in my past life and this one is punishment. I do not even believe in past lives.,Depression
8119,So to me that means that being depressed means I am pressed down I side myself because the environment is not safe for me. Sometimes small changes make the environment safe different dress behaving certain ways etc. But it is more interesting to me how I can change my environment by changing parts of me that I am ok with changing. I do not want to change parts of myself my personality values and characteristics. I like and respect these parts of me that remember reality and events and protect me. But I am willing to change parts of myself like the actions I take to connect with people. The actions I take to be more pushed our into the world environments where it is safe for me to be seen exactly as I truly am. The etymology of depression means to pushpress down,Depression

8787,I have not relapsed this badly in a bit and I am sliding back down the rabbithole and I really do not want to because I know how far this can go and I fear if it will go further this time. I live in a country with strict covid restrictions and we are strongly encouraged to stay home. Dining in has been restricted and I have little excuses to go out besides saying I am going to a friend's house. My friends have been gracious enough to invite me over anytime I need to but my mother would make a lot of negative comments about me leaving the house in this pandemic and it just discourages me to do thingstell her that I want to go somewhere do something. I have been receiving negative reinforcements snide remarks talking behind your back breathing down your neck parenting etc since young and this has affected me a lot as a person and I have been trying to be a better person each day. I met a guy who loved me despite everything and tried to make me a better person too he was my shelter and escape everytime my mum hits me with the negative shit. But recently he abandoned me and left me to fend for myself and he took the light away with him too. Today I signed up for a credit card and was nagged to no end by my mother and was called stupid over something that I did my research for. And it hit me that things have always been like this since I was young. Everything I do is not right and everything I do is dumb and everything I do has to be controlled by her. And I am so drained. I have not cried like today in awhile I know when it is a depressive cry. I need to leave this place and environment. I need to. Sliding back down the rabbithole,Depression

21605,I feel extremely lonely. I drove the only person I love and who treated me kindly and always was there for me away forever. The one time I find love I find it hard to love. she is convinced I am bpd but everytime I asked for help i just feel like I am being ignored and brushed off.

Just turned 23 last month and spent it in bed and with my ex leaving me and telling me its over for ever. We were engaged and planning on having kids in a year. I dk what to do the doctors just give you meds and that is it. I am truely lost and never thought Id make a post like this ever. I feel like I am at the end of the road. Its been a constant cycle since my teens. I can never find peace. And to make it worst I felt like I was going to die around 23. Sorry for rambling I just do not know what to do.

It makes it so hard to do anything. I am home from work today and I have so much I need to do but every time I stand up I feel sick. I just keep laying down.

16626,So title explains most of my problem. I feel like I could sleep less. But right now sleeping is a coping mechanism if I take that away I am scared about what would happen I sleep up to 14 hours a day,Depression
23486,I have suffered depression my entire life but from 2017 2020 I finally felt like I had conquered it. Then COVID hit and I had to isolate. I had to work from home and it felt like I lost my life.Now that vaccines are available and things are starting to return to some normalcy I just cannot snap out of the COVID depression I went into. I am completely unable to function at work and am getting into trouble. I have lost all my confidence and desire to do anything other than sleep.My previous depressions were always drug related. Either taking my meds incorrectly or dabbling in drugs that threw me overboard. This time around there are no drugs. I am doing everything I can to be healthy. Good diet. Try to get good sleep. Tons of exercise. But nothing is snapping me out of it.Maybe it is the WFH thing that has me down. As much as I hate commuting to work I just cannot seem to focus or think anymore. Never had that issue in the office.My workplace is now putting things on me that I cannot handle. I am so stressed Constantly and have no confidence nor desire to do any of the work. I want to just give my 2 weeks and walk away but I am terrified I will not find another job since my qualifications have always been lacking. But how much longer can I take the stress? At some point I am going to be driven over the edge. Whether that be next week or 3 months from now. But I am too scared to look for another job with how I am feeling. What will be different anywhere else? My career is a challenging one and I do not feel up for the challenge anymore. I do not know if it is just COVID or if I have just changed as a person. Is it just a matter of going back into work and feeling like a functional member of society again? Does anyone else feel this way? COVID depression has made me unable to function. Anyone else experience this?,Depression
16972,I have never really recognized my depression like it is recently. I am diagnosed bipolar so normally and normally i rapid cycle but recently my depression is sticking around. I am married and she gave birth to our daughter this past December. I love that little girl more than anything it just feels like i am not enough i know i can do better but i never have the energy just going into work 3 days a week is a mental battle and the other 4 i stay at home watching her i do not know what to do i feel so lost I feel lost.,Depression
25654,My co workers making small talks at work last night and she asked me what I do at home when I am not work. She asked if I went to the gym or went to dance classes or whatever I do. And my mind literally blank and just said I do not do much I just stay at home and I still live with my parents. I felt so pathetic. It just emphasised how much anxiety and depression consumed me. I wish Id be more active in other hobbies and doing other things apart from work. Id love to paint and play music but I do not have the motivation to do so. I just rinse and repeat the day to day tasks. My life is so mundane but I am okay with it. I am just tired. I literally have no life,Depression
10624,What to do in this situation? it is getting harder to put on a smile for everyone when inside I am screaming,Depression

25766,I am bored.. and tired.... I feel like a burden... like I do not entirely matter School is starting in about a month and I am not looking forward to it.. I am scared I will be seen as an embarrassment again. That I will be the laughing stock the weird kid. The kid that cries in the corner.. I do not want people finding out about this.. possible depression either... I am just afraid on someone finding out and either belittling me because my problems are not as important as others... or worse changing how they act around me. Or telling my mom about it... she is suffered so much the past year... plus there is the financial problem.. she just.. cannot find out.... not now.... I am just not happy,Depression
21787,Everyday feels the same and I am distancing myself from my friends. Its not like I want to be alone I actually hate being alone. But I just cannot use my little energy to contact them. they are all so happy and cheerful but I feel so isolated from them. Like they all hate me for me being myself. I guess I do not blame them. My face body voice personality speech I hate it all. And As a cherry on top I am relapsing on my eating disorder god I just want to love my body and I also just want to feel loved. I have not felt so bad since 2017 when I first developed anorexia. I just want things to be normal again nobody should feel this way. I am so damn tired,Depression
11198,there is this guy on whom my bestfriend had a crush on and genuinely i did not find anything attracting in him and years went by she got new crushes and stuff and there was this day where i just remember him randomly and this was not just for hours it went on for months. He is the only thing on my mind and that is when i realized i have fallen bad for this dude and yeah we spoke and i confessed but neither he wanted to date nor me because the age difference is 4 years smth but it is been a year and i still have not moved on from him. Everytime i tryna imagine a perfect guy in the whole damn world it is only him i can think of. how tf am i supposed to move on that dream guy of mine,Depression
26600,...do not even know what to say. I feel like literally nobody actually wants me in their life. I am single and apparently friendless too. Feel like if I did not still live with my parents I would actually see nobody outside of work. The small group of friends I have just had a 4th of July bbq and nobody invited me or even told me it was happening.,Depression
20350,Hello! I have bipolar disorder and general anxiety for a little back groundand I am currently moving states so I do not have my therapist atm. I found a medicine regiment that has been working for me finally but the past 34 days I am having bad depressionlike the lowest of lows that came out of no where. I do not have any energy to do anything. I cannot enjoy things and if I do it is just for a few mins and its gonesometimes feeling worse after. I know that you have to get out more and do things you enjoy to start to come out of it but what do you do when you physically cannot even get the energy to make yourself a tad bit better. it is pretty much crippling at the moment and I hate it. I am not sure how to get out of this slump,Depression

26161,I know there is a top post about this already but I wanted to write to hopefully get this off my chest. Life just seems completely meaningless like there is nothing to live for. I am surrounded by people. People are fucking everywhere. I have lots of friends and possibilities to do just something are endless but they all seem meaningless. I know what I live for but when I cannot make any progress and any and all entertainment seems pointless I just do not know what to live for. The feeling in itself is meaningless because I know there is no intrinsic meaning to be found so why is it there? I know it is triggered by boredom and loneliness but only two days ago I was with my family the whole day. I did not speak to anyone yesterday or today but I do not feel like that is very long at all. I should be able to entertain myself but how..... Life seems meaningless,Depression
37871,i already called in yesterday for work i wa up all night laying here just awake counting down the hour to work wa so exhausted by the time work came around that i called in and even then i couldn t sleep it s now 0 pm and i ve gotten under an hour of sleep in the last 0 hr i m starting to worry a bit this month ha been so hard for me i literally almost walked into traffic on the way to work last week been cry so much i m so alone and it really scare me because i m going through all of this by myself,Depression
23813,When I was fifteen my emotions were pretty concrete like words emanating from an angry mouth with no retrieval. Each syllable sounded so clear like listening to the rustling winds while staring at the moon and being stuck in one place as the ages progressed. Various emotions clearly demarcated like boundary lines separating countries. The world was at peace. Love meant love. Sadness meant sadness. Happiness meant happiness. There was not any intermixing any mixed races.Pain was a traveller transcending moving relocating staying and leaving I run out of verbs. Pain was a libertine leaving bits of it in every emotion until they forgot if they were themselves or just fragments of pain. Moving about the emotion fabric creating ripples and breaking barriers it started tearing my emotions apart. The world seemed to be gathering arms for an impending war.As I got back up still staring at the moon hearing the rustling winds as if they were violin strings creating music in the air ages had progressed. My emotions had lost their colour turned pale with freckles all over them like craters left on the ground by she will bombings.Distortions and clarity are not really akin and thus my emotions became a distorted clarity it was holding on to edges of sanity as its world crumpled in doubt. I was eighteen and I could not differentiate between love and sadness.It stretched and tore apart reaching the limits of insanity trying to be sane. My emotions became half distortions half sanity and I stood somewhere on the boundary of two. The new sanity did not look like the fifteen year old one. It had new ideals. It did not believe in love. It loved sadness. Happiness was once in a month movie treat. Hope had a one day expiry clause.The new distortions were still confused about what the post 2a.m I love you meant. People said it all the time but acted like you were only meant to be loved post 2a.m.It was not half sanity half distortion. It was full pain.By the time I turned twenty I stopped looking at the moon. I closed my eyes and listened to Bach play Concerto in D Minor lying silently in my room. My emotions had a new shape without distortions fully sane. I stared at the fifteen year old me. I smiled as a tear trickled down my cheek.The new emotions founded nostalgia tragic. They had their own ideals. They were coloured with different paints. Pain was no longer a libertine. It was a colonizer.On a particular day in my life when I had started believing in my new concrete emotion like Sisyphus finally accepting his fate someone removed the band aid and the wound was still bleeding. It dwindled trying to erase itself from existence. It no longer knew what it meant. Happiness seemed like a foreign language and there was no translator. It succumbed waiting to die but it was covered in bandages. On days people just termed it as midlife crisis. It was no longer a crisis. It was a war destroying everything.The war is over. Yes Its over. But you need to know It was not a war destroying everything but a god creating something new. The new emotions are beautiful like a symmetric circle rising up into the heaven looking much like a divine halo. It is no longer countries called happiness or sadness or love or hope or pain. Its one huge continent named life mixing everything in a perfect blend. When the worlds broke a tiny broken part formed a small ring overshadowing my emotions and on days nothing is beautiful. It is just my fears and my insecurities and everything dark like a distortion.On days I wonder if it is my emotions hiding my insecurities or the other way round. But at least the war is over. There is no distorted clarity. Age of emotions,Depression
14067,I 19m have a relentlessly emotionally abusive father. He claims to love us my mom me and my older brother but whenever the slightest thing goes wrong he snaps and turns into a monster. Then he has the gall to argue that its all our fault. The worst part is how he demands Godlike respect from us his own wife my mom included and then just fucking shits all over us like were expendable dolls with human faces. I honestly do not feel like I have a dad anymore and I have had intrusive thoughts about doing horrible things to him but I know I could never actually do it. I am so lost and broken and I fucking hate the man my mom married. To add insult to injury she is a saint. I love my mom she is always kind to everyone and this is with the same pressure that my dad deals with that he complains about and uses as an excuse do not Know How to Cope with Emotionally Abusive Father,Depression
15643,What do you do when you are at your absolute lowest. I hate my job and I cannot think straight about what other job I want because I am always there. When I am not I just want to forget who I am and play games with my friends. I lost my love. My self worth is non existent. My therapist wants me to go on anti depressants as she is drained and thinks they will put fuel in my fire as I do not seem to have any. Haunted by things I want but cannot get like a decent relationship and someone that loved me and does not further hurt me. I just cannot get my shit straight. I am scared of the anti depressants. I am scared of my depression. I live for my family and just not to put them through pain. But I just cannot make any headway. I cannot feel good about myself or think yes I can. Only no I cannot. I am worthless and scared of everything.I feel like I am treading water. Delaying the inevitable one day at a time. Work.. work work bloody work.,Depression
8936,I apologize in advance for any spelling mistakes and other errors i will probably make.Well the post title is just that living is fun and all sometimes but i just cannot handle it anymore. No matter what i try i either end up hurting myself more in the progress or failing miserably from the beginning.I applied for roughly 30 jobs in the last two months and almost got rejected from everyone because i had a burnout in my senior year due to my teacher and my sister moving out. And the ones where I actually managed to get an interview quickly shut me down because i got self harm scars from when i was younger.And ofc the only way i know how to get rid of this shit is either SH or drowning out my sorrows in videogames and just pretending it did never happen.But that is not the part that makes me not be alive anymore i got an emotionally abusive mother and an physical abbusive father the occasional kick or punch i can deal with but it my mother who really hurts me. Every single time something is missing in the house Dosent matter what it is. I get accused of taking it eating it or having it last and thus loosing it. Followed up by a verbal assault of what a disappointment i am how useless i am and how she sometimes wishes she would have aborted me.I often considered running away atleast to a friend or atleast the unemployment office to get away from here. But the last time i brought up living with a friend for a month she ran into my parents room threatening to kill herself if i moved away.In the last couple of weeks it has been extra rough for me idk why but i just cannot seem to let go of the past. Like rn i just lay in bed trying to fall asleep but just cannot and keep doing stuff to drown out the memories of my best friend simply using me to get closer to crush to date her and then botch ditching me.Another friend of mine just using me for money because she knew i needed someone and that i would buy her things just to not leave me alone again.Seeing my best friend since middle school slowly getting addicted to drugs until he killed himself.My first gf cheating on me and even afterwards telling me how good it felt.And tbh the thing that hurts the most is Hannah she was a friend of my GF and me at the time and when shit hit the fan she was there for me i cried so fucking much during that time and she was there for me i tried to be the best friend i could at that time cheering her up even though I was fucked myself. But apparently i did not do good enough of a jobIt would be better for all of us if you finally killed yourself That still sticks with me today i think about it every single time i get closer to someone every time i talk to a friend. That maybe they all think so and she was right that i should stop beeing such a pussy and finally kill myself.Its funny that i kept this to almost last tbh maybe its because i do not really want to talk about it or because it happened at such a young age that is its practicaly a part of me at this point when i was i think 8 or 9 I was sexually assaulted by an older classmate i think 11 or 12 I am sorry for the numbers.At first it Started out as playing then someday he just undressed and acted like nothing was wrong and suggested we play doctors and such idk what is he called it I am sorry. Idk it just kind of happened and then stopped someday when he switched schools. I cannot have a bodily relationship with anyone if someone hugs me without asking and telling me beforehand i get panic attacks when i layed in bed once with a friend of mine i had to get up because i just could not stay next to bed in ber and feel scared.I just do not want to live with all this fucking baggage anymore every single day seems to get worse and worse. And there is nothing i can do about it.I am sorry if you read this you should not have but i just needed somewhere to write this downI just do not want all this fucking baggage Sometimes i just do not want to live anymore or atleast not as myself.,Depression
48228,Here comes the low... Was in a good mood today and I feel it dissipating Im terrified of going back down into that pit. Theres no hope down there only agony and self hatred. Why cant I escape this? Why does my past always drive me to feeling suicidal?,Depression
16575,Stop therapy a couple years ago bc i was dependent on my parents and became afraid of them. My logic was that if i stopped therapy then they would not have to drive me and i could spend less time with them.I resorted to watching youtubers to help me sort through my mind and I would like to think that I am better. I am not suicidal nor do I want to self harm anymore but i still feel like shit.So yeah I would like to think I am better but not sure if I am. I can technically go do the counseling to which there are 8 free sessions in college rn and it covers the 8 sessions. I also can drive and will be dorming so I will not have to worry about my parents. I am worried about the time cost though 8 hours is still 8 hours. Also I am afraid of having to cut counseling short bc I will prob be too emotionally invested by the end of the 8 sessions without working through my issues. How do you know if you still are struggling?,Depression
17355,Hate. Hate is too kind a word for the detestability I selfinflict upon myself. I am a traitor in my own mind. Wanting to betray my heart and usurp the throne. I have purloined my soul and left it an empty vessel. I take heed not of my salvation for I do not fear death I fear life more than any mercenary. It is a cruel and unjust bishop that shall condemn me to a purgatory of an unpayable debt I shall never reimburse. I shall not yield I shall be my own executioner. However I will fight kick and scream. I will writhe like a woman in labour. Until this fateful day shall I meet this hooded apparition? Will he embrace me as kin or shall he cast me away like? I am the last soldier on the precipice of hope. I shall defend against the unending hoard. I shall clad myself with the armour of a steely stubborn will Greaves to protect my falling ambition into a chasm of inhibition and I shall wear a pair of Gaped Gauntlets to wield my blade of desperation. I will fight until my inevitable damnation. I am endowed with eternal hate this I know...is my fate. Fighting Demons,Depression
13744,All I am is a cesspool of mistakes hurting others and pain. Why should I even exist? No one would care if I was gone. I am a horrible human being. I am poison,Depression
24066,I have had what is likely depression for about 3 years now. I do not know why it came about and I do not understand why its going away. But its wrong and I do not want to get better.I am so used to the familiarity of it. There was a certain amount of comfort to those feelings of numbemptiness or just plain heaviness. I had my low times I selfharmed and it sorta got better for a week before going downhill the cycle repeating 2 weeks after. It was reliable. It was known. It made the highs feel better.But for a few months now I have been by most views improving. I have less depressive episodes. It went from 3 weeks to 5 to 8. The sadness behind the selfharm is fading and as it does the strength of temptations grows weaker.And yet I cling to what remains. I am not ready to get better. I am not ready to lose the comfort of harming. The depression is part of who I am at this point and I do not know how to live without it. Perhaps because my depression never had a clear because there is no closure nothing in my life has improved to justify or explain me getting better.I am here because my partner suggested I ask if anyone else has experience with this. I am not really sure how much you all will know of this but its worth a shot. Thank you in advance. I am getting better and I hate it.,Depression
14741,So I just dropped my BF 31 off at the hospital this morning for the first time ever. He had an attempted suicide in the night by taking extra antidepressants when he woke up in the middle of the night. Hes been open with me about being depressed and has been good about taking his medication. The whole situation was scary. I called in sick right away to spend the day with him which is when he proceeded to tell me why he was upset and what happened in the middle of the night while I slept. When we got to emerg I was told I could not go in with him so I waited in the car. They got him in quickly and I was being updated as they slowly took everything away from him and he spoke with medical people. Then they took his phone and it hit me like a tone of bricks. I had no idea anything that was happening and I was just trusting these people. Covid fucking sucks! I wanted to be there ask the doctors what is happening what hes allowed or not. I wanted to bring him a snack when he was hungry. All I could do was hold on tight to my phone for the day and hope I would hear from him. I have received 2 calls from him now. I know a bit more but I am still on edge. Any significant others on here that have some advice for how to do this? I am just very scared but logically I know hes in a safe space. First hospital visit,Depression
11555,I have been going to a professional and taking antiDs for a while now. Its been a huge help and I am able to work and get through the day without feeling like heavy and slow. My girlfriend has seen a professional once in her life years ago but stopped. Her mother is against medicine and she does not want to try antidepressants because she does not want to deal with her mother. Were both legal adults. I want to get her help and I honestly feel helpless its putting a strain in our relationship. Has anyone been in a similar situation with a person they care about? How did you get over that obstacle? How should I go about this? Girlfriend and I are depressed. I am actively trying to get out of depression but she does not want to. How can I help her?,Depression

7357,My worst nightmare is coming true.My world is falling apart. I have no idea how I will tell my friends or parents. I hate that it will be confirmed that I am an idiot and that everyone will see me as one.I have always wanted to graduate and I need to for what I want to do.I am thinking that I should not be here. Future looks incredibly bleak and it is confirmed I am worthless.Literally no reason to not die besides me being too pussy to do so. Getting kicked out of school,Depression
38989,i don t know how i can feel this horrible and unable to breathe so badly and this only be anxiety i genuinely feel like i m going to pas out and i have nothing to be anxious about is this really what anxiety feel like i can t take a deep breath this is so awful,Depression
37707,it s just a constant reminder that you don t really have any friend seeing everyone having fun laughing hanging out with eachother and then there s me depressing awkward and lonely i fucking hate it i just can t take it every single day being reminded of how much of a sad loser i am,Depression
13833,I am so done. I have to deal with my parents constantly breaking down my confidence that I am trying to work on and being VERY mentally abusive. I get comments about my weight my intelligence my clothing style my actions etc. I cannot even breath without being judged. my parents like to twist the word respect so i get treated like shit but then I have to walk on eggshells when I am around them. it is not like I am a bad kid. I have A'sB's planning for college never get into any trouble yet I am constantly ridiculed like I am the worst kid in the world. Then I have my friends where recently they have been judging me as well for multiple things. They make my parents sound like they are the best and chillest parents ever when they have NO idea what happens behind closed doors. I have ADHD and anxiety and one of the things that I do is that I cannot function if my hands are dry so i carry around lotion with me. EVERY time i would take out the lotion they would give me a weird look. They also like to call me out on a lot of things or call me names just at random and it does not help my already not very mental state. My one friend has called me a 'pig' before on multiple occasions and always has to point out my SH scars and call them 'tic tac toe' like its some sort of joke when all it does is make me want to cut again. I am trying so hard to work on myself and work on my confidence but I feel like I am suffocating. OH also to mention I have found out alcohol causes my spiraling thoughts to temporarily go away so now I am trying not to start an addiction to either SH or Alcohol but I have no one to fucking help me or be there for me without having that feeling of being judged. I also had my girlfriend try to hurt herself and her homophobic parents found out about us so now I have not heard from her for over 2 weeks. I am trying to cope with everything and no one even seems to care. I am just a fucking kid yet I feel like everyone is treating me like I should know how to fix every single problem I have. I want someone to hold my hand and tell me it is going to be okay. I want that embrace of a hug that makes me feel like all my problems have gone away. I want help. I want to be happy like how I was when I was younger. Why did I have to grow up so fast. I am done with constant mental abuse,Depression
8171,M 20 So I am writing this cuse iv been wanting to get it off my chest iv tried killing my self last week by overdosing and sent to the hospital then to a mental health facility i got out in 4 days and when I was in there I was feeling a lot better and thought I can do this but when I got out I realized that I am back were I started I am on antidepressants but you still have suicide thoughts and still depressed its so weird that I am alive and I have to work and live idk how to explain that but I was not ready to keep going with life I do not really have a purpose or some that cares about me I just want to be loved and wanted .Iv been bullied in high school cuse I was special ed and really quite it felt like if I said something worng or stupid they just laugh I just struggled with my math and English because I was in special ed class I struggle alot in the really world like with work. I had friends but I felt they just use me for my money so they were just being kind. after high school so called friends started using drugs and i have stayed off that path trying to be good. had a hard time talking to females very shy never went on a date to high school I wanted to date after tried dating apps went to partys and never made a connection. if I chose to live i want to live knowing I not alone like a girlfriend or some who cares and I can cry on there shoulder and they can tell me its all right I know how it feels. parents are not any help when in high school they verbal abused me so that and the bulling at school fuck me up there better now but I cannot talk to them and tell them you made my life even harder. I look at people I know and there happy getting married and have a good time and I ask my self why cannot I be like what is wrong with me that iv tried to put my self put there but nothing works Thank you if your reading this sorry for spelling errors if your depressed or suicide you not alone it hurts so much I know hugs for evey one love My suicide attempt and my story,Depression
21089,I am trying so hard to avoid selfdestructive behavior. Drinking selfharming engaging with people I should not. Wallowing. it is getting harder and harder to avoid. Every day I feel myself losing my grip a little more and soon I am going to falter and do something stupid. And the coping mechanisms are becoming less and less effective. I know the path I am on. I know where it goes.I know all of this but I am powerless to stop it. Selfdestructive behavior,Depression
8478,I am 24M living in Parents' house. My dad has dreams about business and he thinks I am the guy who is going to complete those dreams. I never did a job anywhere. So I have poor work ethic. I do not know how to spend like literally I live on things I only need becuase that is how I brought up. On the other hand my brother dad and mom spend lot of money on things which I would not have bought because I am conditioned in that way. Even if I want something important but expensive thing I would convince myself that it is not needed and would go for cheaper alternative.To conclude I do not have good work ethic I feel guilty everytime I 'overspend' I am 24 yo useless guy Not to mention ugly I do not think I can do business and there are lot of expectations from family and Girlfriend.

8740,You want someone to feel emotional pain?? Why?? I think that sounds wonderful if no one could cry at my funeral I would not want to bring emotional pain like that to someone especially if its someone I care about. I think that is the thing driving me from ever kicking the chair. I hate to offend but I think that is selfish to wish for someone to feel emotional grief like that have you seen someone go through grief??? Its terrible. Its ugly and painful and I would not wish it on anyone. So why would you want someone to go through that? Sorry if I hurt someone by saying this I do not intend this to be offensive I am just astounded that people genuinely think this and I want to know why? I hate it when someone says no one is going to cry for me when I am gone,Depression
19435,No one cares though lol. I am going to overdose rn. I am just done trying. Nobody gives a fuck about me. I am not doing anything well. I am bad at everything I do. what is the point of living if I am useless. I just bother people and eventually people get tired of me being depressed and suicidal for years. They end up leaving. Well see yah world! cannot say Ill miss you I want to die so bad,Depression
16158,It does not change. Nothing ever changes. I do not know what is wrong with me but I am starting to not care. I had suicidal thoughts and ideation for about 13 years i think up until this year they stopped but I noticed so did all of my empathy compassion kindness and really any other feeling. I am in a perpetual state of not caring about anything or anyone. I just do not care anymore. I just want out really. I am too fucking broken to live I am too abnormal to have a normal life. I wish I knew what was wrong what does everyone see in me that scares them away? What the fuck is wrong with me? I do not know I just wish I could sleep forever. I am so tired of this life,Depression
39354,to be fair i don t have access to much of my family s history past my parent so i don t know if there s a possibility that someone in my family tree had anxiety but when i wa younger i remember taking online test about anxiety because i couldn t see a therapist then worrying about the result did i somehow create my anxiety by self diagnosis then spin it into the real thing,Depression
20379,I have been doing really bad and called my psychiatrists office twice last week trying to get an earlier appointment than today and that was my bad I was too depressed to bother calling back. I feel like that should have been concerning to them though.Today I finally had my scheduled phone appointment and it was supposed to happen at 320. He never called. I am so frustrated I feel like I have been crying out for help for so long and he did not even care enough to call. Its just made me feel even more insignificant and worthless.I always thought he did not care because hes always talked over me in appointments and never seems to remember anything about me after two years and does not seem to have even bothered to read my file before we meet. I did not really need todays confirmation and its a real kick to the stomach. I do not know what I am going to do anymore. I just want help I am so tired of fighting the system Vent about shitty Psychiatrist,Depression
16928,I do not think I really can afford professional help or medication but I was wondering if one day I could feel hopeful like if one day I can save up enough and somethinganything can make my brain not make me feel like absolute shit and I can feel somewhat peaceful? I am not expecting a one time fix I know it does not work like that and I am aware anti dep do not make you cheery all of a sudden but even if it just makes the hopeless heavy feeling on my chest feel somewhat alleviated Does medication help?!,Depression

26755,I have dealt with depression for the majority of my life. I had trouble with it as a teenager tried to kill myself while I was in the service while on vacation at home during the holiday and it just keeps coming back every so often. I imagine ending it often but have not actively tried in a long time. I just feel like a failure. I am about to turn 40 and I do not even like to look myself in the mirror anymore. Life just does not seem fulfilling. I daydream a lot about my past and what I should have done instead. I thought really hard about just ending it yesterday but did not go thru with it. How do you cope? What do you do to try and keep going? I do not know what to do anymore,Depression
18640,she is absolutely horrible. She seems to blame our fucked up relationship ALLL on me! Like NONE of its apparently her fault. She has this thing where she is ALWAYS a victim. And she literally thinks she is perfect. Like if you ask her what flaws she has its something like I am to nice and let people use me. My dad is abusive and I am very similar to him facial wise and a little bit personality wise too I am NOT abusive! my other siblings take after my mom so she likes them more. I am basically a replacement for my father and all the problems she has with him have been placed on me. She calls me abusive at the drop of a hat and constantly calls me names. Yet somehow I am the fucked up one. Like right now we just got in a fight and she is still arguing with me even though I gave up and I am listening to music now.Our relationship is over even if in the far off future she apologized or something which would not happen unless hell freezed over she is done to much damage. Sometimes just being around her disgusts me. Anyway.. I am so sick of my mom,Depression
47639,Please help Ive been stuck in another depressive episode for months now. My last one was 4 years ago and I really thought thats the end of it. I dont understand how I got here again. I cant live like this and Im lost on what to do. Im just trying to exercise everyday but I feel awful.,Depression
19495,Anyone here? I really like a girl in junior high but was too scared to talk to her. Everyone laughed at me for being a coward Ever since I have had pain and depression anyone have a similar story? Depression due to heartbreak?,Depression

17186,Feels kind of weird posting about this on Reddit but if it helps then I might as well.I am 16 years old depressed and was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome at age 6 along with being tested for autism multiple times none of them came back and I am fairly certain I am not on the spectrum or at least not noticeably and Asperger's once. I had an abusive stepfather for about 9 years from when I was 3 to when I was about 1112. I have just finished my GCSEs and I am waiting on my grades. I have always been a high achiever always been placed on gifted and talented lists always used to bury myself in science textbooks and documentaries. Back before I had access to the Internet my education was almost a coping mechanism. Still now it feels like a lot of other people deserve their academix success a damn sight more than I do. Compared to a lot of people on this subreddit I should be incredibly lucky. But I do not think my luck can be much worse. I am in a friends with benefits type relationship with a girl that I have loved for about 2 years and we still love each other but I used to talk to her about all of my depression and suicidal tendencies and now we have got a strict rule that I cannot talk to her about it anymore. Which tbf is for the best. That does not mean it does not hurt though. I guess my main problem is that I feel isolated almost all the time. Even in a room of people I feel like I am alone. Sometimes even when I am with her. Back when I had that abusive stepfather I remember sitting in my room in a corner too afraid to leave or even move until my mum came home. I have grown up since then but on the inside that is still how I feel. I have gone through countless friend groups who do not give a shit about me I have only ever found three or four real friends yet I feel awful telling them about anything I have experienced or I am feeling. I tried to tell my teachers that they were putting me under too much stress and then they decide to tell my mum when I asked them not to. Queue me being treated like an alien for weeks. I have written countless rants suicide note drafts sad monologues and it is getting tiring. The suicidal stuff gets terrifying sometimes... I have a massive fear of death but I do not want to keep on living in this kind of world. I am not always suicidal and to be honest today has been a really good day for me. But it is not like that makes it go away. Sometimes I am scared of what is going to happen to me in X amount of years. In fact that is pretty much all of the time. As I get older I start to realise that my childhood is slowly slipping away from me and that I should probably enjoy what is left of it as much as I can yet... I do not think I have ever really enjoyed my childhood. I am going to stop there since I would be here for days otherwise. If you made it this far thanks for reading. Typing into the void.,Depression
38093,i feel like i ll never get a girlfriend i m i also have a genetics disorder i feel like no woman will ever want me because of it i don t think you can tell i have it but i feel once i tell them that they won t want me i ve been feeling really depressed about it and i m scared to talk to woman so that doesn t help,Depression
9983,My dad always says it is all about perspective. We all have our windows through which we see the world and our reality is how we chose to perceive it. Sometimes even the most complex problem just requires a shift in perspective or a view through another person's window before it can be solved with ease.I have given up on life. I am not quite sure how to describe it I guess it is just one of those things you know like when you are in love when you are hungry or just need the loo. I suppose the symptoms are easily identifiable apathy melancholy depression fatigue lethargy etc but there is a lessmedical term that I think describes it better my light has gone out.Who I am does not really matter though for completeness's sake my executive summary details are 21 Male 2nd Year Engineering student from South Africa caucasian with Danish and English ancestry single always have been probably on the spectrum no friends anymore.I have buried my best and closest friend and another four friends over the past five years. I have been wrongfully accused of a crime that I never committed which took the system a year of intimidation court rooms and sever depression and anxiety to determine that she had made it all up. I have been a victim of extortion blackmail and cybercrimes involving intimidation fear and had no one to talk to. I am the eldest of three and the eldest of my family's generation and link that keeps my stressedout family together. I have felt the feeling of loving another but never the feeling of it being mutual. I was once a happy child in a happy house with a dream of changing the world and the aptitude to do it. But today I do not see the point of it all. My friends are dead the person I am in love with and the only person I have every loved does not feel the same way. I have horrors tormenting me each night that I cannot tell anyone about I am half way through second year and I have only been on campus for four weeks before lockdown I do not have much money I have lost focus on studies altogether and I am only 21 years old.Perspective. The only thing my sorry engineering mind could come up with was getting a different perspective on things and maybe just maybe I might find a path that will lead me to well enlightenment i.e. to get the light back.You obviously do not know me from a bar of soap but maybe I need impersonal advice I do not know. As the title suggests despite living in the tech world since before I could walk this is my first and only online post. I am a shy person who is got nowhere to go and looking for some guidance.Thanks My first and only online post. I think I may be giving up on life but looking for a reason not to.,Depression
16616,If you can sleep like all day and are still tired is this a possible depression symptom and can anyone explain why this is? And why does not rest help the mind feel happier? This is so odd to me Sleeping question,Depression
12351,Spent an childhood being yelled at to grow up and now Am i grown up? And if I am is everyday just suffering?

16001,Have been fighting clinical depression for awhile.

14192,When I was 13 or 14 I was bullied in our class. These bullies called me names and physically intimidate me. I had a melt down once in our house my parents were confused. I told them everything its like for them my problem was not a big deal at all. That was when I start to emotionally not totally shutdown my self to my family. I have never speak about my emotional problems to them ever. Now that I am 24 all that suppressed emotions bite me in my ass now. I do not know if I have depression anxiety or panic attack but I am sure i was suffering their symptoms. I do not know what to do anymore. Everything so blurry. I cannot focus to my job. I cannot enjoy the things that I used to enjoy. My sleeping condition is getting worst as the time passed by. I just feel like I am sinking in a quick sand. I just want some advice on how to cope with this condition. I cannot continue my life with this. I cannot speak this to anyone in my life. I am too afraid. I need help. Wanting to speak about my depression but also being afraid to speak about it.,Depression
22609,So basically I started cutting my wrists and some of my friends found out. They told me to stop so I said I did it was a complete lie. I thought they had believed me. But they did not because somehow the school counselor found out. At some point people started fucking with me because for like 2 weeks straight he was calling me to his office every other day because someone kept saying I was still cutting myself which I was not. In one of the meetings he told me that I have obviously become someone people need to worry about and that shit hit deep. I cried about it later because that made me feel so bad. It is not even the worst thing I have had said to me but it hurt so bad for some reason. I think its because I never wanted to be the person people had to worry about. He also told my parents that they should consider putting me in a mental institution... like wtf? Things have just gone downhill from there though. COVID happened I became overweight Which would not be a bad thing if my parents were so harsh about it. In one instance My mom made me try on shirts she knew would not fit me anymore and when they were tight she told me it made her feel better. I have been lonely I lost one of my best friends because he thought I liked him as more than a friend and accused me of things now he responds to my texts hours later with K or cool. I am sad and people tell me I only act sad for attention even though I try my best to hide it. Well you have obviously become someone people.need to worry about.,Depression
20800,hiii. I have been going to therapy for like 23 years now and its been great and all but I am starting to realize that I have been going in circles. everytime we meet i just talk about how shitty life is i get recommended a way to fix life i try it a little then i quit when it gets hard. i have even started noticing my therapist getting impatient with me even though she is normally the sweetest and most understanding person I have met.I have always struggled with motivation and opted for the easiestmost comfortable route. and I have tried changing that in the past but its really really hard. but I am not trying to give up.it feels like I am waiting for some eyeopening life changing experience to motivate me to change but i know that is bad. i want change NOW but i just cannot get myself to do iti just feel utterly lost in life but i want to stop feeling so shitty any advice?

26355,Been struggling for 10 years with depression always somehow managed to function. But it is coming back stronger than ever. I just feel so tired all the time and nothing brings me joy. My plants died my instruments gathers layers of dust and instead of enjoying a game I sit in front of my Playstation and stare into the black until it is time to go to bed. Not that I am able to sleep but I am allowed to lay there.I feel empty. I just started changing my life doing things I had been waiting years for and now that I am able to do this nothing. Just nothing. I somehow wish my house would burn down. Or a car would take pity on me while I cross the street. I do not feel strong enough to make a change. I am a loser that cannot be grateful for anything and I know it could be way worse. But that is not making it easier for me.I am just deadly tired. it is coming back and everything's too much,Depression
47285,I want to give up Can't stop being toxicI know I don't want to be but I can't change,Depression
21228,I have been playing metal gear solid for about a week now and I am at the second to last boss and I cannot fucking beat him. This is so cringe but it makes me feel like I cannot even do anything. I cannot beat this fucking game. I want to so bad but I just cannot. I have like 20 hours on the game and I have seen people beat in in 6. I am so fucking bad at this game and I feel fucking worthless because of it. I know how fucking dumb that sounds. I cannot do anything including beating this easy ass game. I cannot finish this game and it makes me depressed,Depression
13612,So yeah since last time posting here I tried to stand up against everything that got thrown into my face. Hypocracy insults complaints and the ever same jokes where the only point is that I am fat.I just cannot anymore. I had a breakdown where I cried about it all being too much to cope with and at the same time In just laughed. I laughed because it was just so funny. Seing this alcoholic asshole cry. Asking how much more till he is in for the white I cuddle myself jackets. How many times he can be broken more.I get insults and complaints pretty much everyday when I am not alone or with a selected couple of friends.To that I just want to scream fuck you you wanted me here I am just here because you needed my car a fucking mule or some idiot to do the shit you are too stupid to. Tell me what you want in a normal tone or fuck offBut I never do. I just sit there and bear it.And for what?So that a few seconds later I can be told why are not you happy? I just told you everything you do is shit. Ohhh are you a crybaby?Just let me die already. Throw me in the forest so the wild animals can eat me. If they dare at this smell... New discoverings from the fat alcoholic pothead,Depression
48061,California rocketfuel Effexor75mg Mirtazepine 30mg and CBD Hey Im currently on 75mg effexor and 30mg mirtazepine. So far I have been taking xanax for anxiety however I am thinking of trying CBD. Has anyone mixed these meds with CBD and that are your experiences?,Depression
19505,This is not how I feel all the time but when I do it hits hard. I have felt like I could break down at any moment for the past month or so. I do not want to mention it to anyone I know especially people who actually care about me because 1. there is nothing they can do about it 2. People start to treat you differently 3. People get upset when they know you are upset and that makes me more upset4. Most people can probably tell I am not in a great place just by the look on my face and my tone of voice and prefer to stay out of itSo I am sharing my feelings with you wonderful people instead. do not feel obligated to try to help. It just helps me a little to know that someone is listening. Existence is pain,Depression
13092,Worked with a councillor for a while who really helped me with gaining tools to stop my negative thoughts. I have slipped back into them and using these tools is harder now since they do not feel believable. I worked on affirmations breaking down negative thoughts roots of low self esteem and positive qualities with her. When I try to go through them now I just do not believe the positive conclusions I am supposed to make by the end or I get caught up in my documented negative thoughts. Only affirmations seems to work or are believable when I am very depressed. How to make psychotherapy believable?,Depression
16595,my IQ was tested professionally in middle school with my quotient being in the rather bright range. This is starting to feel more like a curse than a blessing I am anxious all the time and i cannot sleep socializing with people is exhausting because they never have anything interesting to say. All I do is get called weird by everyone I meet for being too quiet. I seriously wish i was average. My IQ is making me miserable,Depression
18086,i live through pain. i feel like the living embodiment of pain and trauma. but something gives me this drive to overcome it. i feel like I have been through the most. the only negative thing i have not experienced is the loss of a parenthomelessness or severe physicalhospital pain. everything else mentally traumatically growing up i have experienced. and i have lost family. being in pain puts my feet firmly on the ground and for some reason makes me see my reality exactly as it isonce there it can only go up. because ultimately my mind forces my body to do any and everything to avoid thinking about the thing causing me pain its got to the point for me where i actually thrive from being in pain,Depression
12084,I have developed a negative relationship to food where I feel it that it takes up so much energy time and money. I do not even like to taste things. I eat for a function not a pleasure. Having a history of an eating disorder does not help and although I am out of the disorder by a couple of years with this depressive bout I am sure the lingering effects are there. Now I really struggle to have a meal at most a day. I am slow and tired and that is part because and effect of this cycle. what is ways that has helped you break out of this loop? Thank you guys and keep striving to more content and pleasureable days. How do you start eating?,Depression
14207,I have a classmate who had serious depression she is better now and i find it annoying to see half the girls in my class acting fucking depressed for compliments and attention when its a actual problem people face people were not taking her seriously because of this so please if you know anyone who does this tell them to stop Sonething i need to adress,Depression

39339,i have severe eco anxiety sometimes it s so bad i have a breakdown and think how can i possibly go on with life if it s headed somewhere so awful i m always worried about my future ever since i wa a kid however most of the time when i m doing okay i want to keep living and i want to do what i can to make that happen i so often see people saying such morbid and pessimistic thing about the future like they ve already given up and i find this so disheartening i also don t think many people realize what this attitude doe to people mental health it is incredibly harmful this kind of opinion breed consequence and make more and more people feel the same way i just want everyone to think about what they say on the internet and how it can be harmful anger and negativity don t do any good so let s not waste time and energy focusing on the bad that wa done rather we should focus on what we can do and how we can help no matter how small the worst thing you can do for the planet is expect someone else to save it please remember it s never too late to save the planet edit i wanted to add something marketing it a powerful tool study have shown that fear mongering doe not work and just creates despair and inaction people need to believe the planet it saveable to save it so when talking about these issue please try to leave the intense negativity aside also i don t want everyone to feel like the world is on their shoulder i just want to do what i can to create a more optimistic attitude towards the future any small change you can make make a difference,Depression
21117,Going to to acid next weekend. I have been prone to paranoid delusions and panic attacks but I have always felt like the drug has helped me grow in the long run. I feel like it forces you to immediately confront your inner most thoughts and there is great therapeutic value in this. I have nothing to say really just post experiencesprecautions etc. Acid,Depression

13670,I will never be attractive enough. I will never be funny enough. I will never be anything to anyone but a background character that is never anyone's first thought. I seriously do not understand why people tell me that I am attractive and mean it sincerely but whenever my confidence boosts and I try to get back into dating I just get nothing. No matches online inperson shit just fizzles out. How the fuck have the majority of people had multiple relationships and lost their virginity in their teens and what the fuck went wrong where I did not? At this point I am resentful of my parents for even giving birth to me. I did not ask for this life and I did not ask to be alive. I am just done. Dating is impossible.,Depression

17946,online school is stressing me out so much. NSW is back in lockdown for the month which means online learning. I have attended all my classes except maths so far because fuck maths it gives me so much anxiety and when the fuck am I ever going to have to use my knowledge of the area of a parallelogram in the future? All I need for a psychology degree is knowhow in statistics. Also fuck mood shifts. I just want to run away. god fucking damn it,Depression
26690,For context I am 16 year old and I know none of this is going to be believable or make any sense but I currently attend full time college and am finishing in December. I also work full time as a cyber sec professional. So from that obviously you may think damn I bet this kid is living a great life... well the truth is I am dying inside. I have an amazing girlfriend but my upbringing was hell. Growing up I was starved neglected abused emotionally left lied to and more because my parents were drug addicts and alcoholics I never had anyone. My mom passed due to the abuse and I think that is why my mental illness is so bad. I appear to be living an amazing life but everyday my mood changes like crazy and I just want to leave everything. I hate waking up and I hate sleeping... I just hate everything. Everything tiks me off and I am just so overwhelmed with my own emotions. I am sad as fuck 247 for no reason I feel I have extreme past thramu from my younger days and I just am done. I am still living at home and am going to move the day I turn 18 I already have for a place but in the meant time I have two more years of hell to go through. I have 0 friends anymore because I am very busy and do not have time to do what I used to which is not that bad but I just am alone. All my friends are above 20 so its hard to relate. I cannot go hang with them because its just feels weird because I am at such a different stage of life than they are but at the same time I am not.... Idek if this makes any sense its just a massive brain dump but take what you wish and any advice i would love. I am 16 and am on top of the world little does everyone know I am dying inside.,Depression

26528,Looked at myself naked in the mirror and was shocked to see how skinny I have gotten. Over the past year in quarantine I have been depressed and have not been eating much. Homecooked meals are not delicious so I do not eat much. The thing I eat the most of is white rice. I feel too guilty to eat out. Family noticed how bony and skinny I have gotten before I did. How do I not feel nauseous when thinking about eating? How do I deal with the guilt of having food available but choosing not to eat? I liked my body before but I feel like I have ruined it. What do I do? I am now too skinny. How do I deal with the guilt and nausea?,Depression
19618,I just turned 16 I have already lost my sense of accomplishment regressed socially gotten sadder and I am loosing hope for my future if I ever have one. I keep getting upset over the smallest things I tell my family how I feel but they do not know how to help I am switching medication every other week to treat anxiety I cannot ever focus on the positive I am always miserable the first thing people think of me is that I am depressed afraid to talk or is just weird whenever anyone says anything positive about me I never believe it even if I want to and life is a 510 even thought my family is good house is good school is good the few friends I have are good but everything is just terrible. Why is life so mean to me Everything is ok or bad in my life,Depression

14908,Maybe its just me alone in this but it feels like both the job market and the housing market are so inexplicably fucked. I am 23 years old and still live with my fucking family because no matter what fucking job I get I do not make enough fucking money to live in this shit hole of a town. Tried to apply for something better with my degree and instead I just hear Jack shit back. No apartments or homes available for rent are anywhere near my price range and I just cannot move out of town because that costs money I do not fucking have. This close to ending it all because there is no way out. Fuck it all Everything is so fucked,Depression
19275,I feel like every day I have to pretend to be happy. I work at a family shelter for starters and I have to at least put a smile on for the kids who are staying there.My mom starved me as a kid and as a young adult now I do not speak with her. I have very little family left and if I have any issues so do they and I need all the support I can get.My SO makes me very happy and very sad. We have good and bad moments times that make me stare off and picture them with a perfect match someone who would make them happier than I can ever pretend to be.Every day I wake up go to work come home eat dinner and hide from those around me. All while the entire day pretending to be happy and content with my life and the people around me.Playing the role of a person who has their life figured out. Happy funny motivated tired scared finite. I have no choice but to act every day until I am completely alone.And eventually I will act at my wedding act at my friends weddings act when my kids are born act when they graduate act when they get married or act until I decide my curtains will close forever.I am the worlds greatest actor.And I hate all of my movies. I am the worlds greatest actor.,Depression
18540,Everything hurts. Not enough that I cannot function but enough that I struggle. Work is hard. I am on my feet for hours and I come home and I am in so much pain the moment I sit I cannot move for hours. I got new shoes and it does not help much. Today my entire chest and stomach was shocked with pain and I nearly cried but I could not breathe. I was in public too so I just sat until it passed. My ribs still hurt and that was hours ago. Nothing makes me feel better. I cannot afford to go to any special doctors and even if I could they would tell me to lose weight. I fucking want to but everything hurts so damn much and I never have energy and half the things I eat make my stomach feel like its going to explode. I do not want this fucking body. I hate how it looks I hate how it makes me feel I hate how hard it is to do basic tasks. I look in the mirror and I want to cry. I hate this fucking flesh vessel. I wish I could cut it into chunks and throw it away. I do not want it. It only makes me miserable. I just want energy to try and fix something about this so I can feel a little better. I do not want this body,Depression
16310,Looking at my life it is getting harder and harder to see the point of it all. Life is nothing but a cycle of negative emotions and the waiting period between feeling them. I do not love myself because I honestly cannot see anything worth loving I am fat and ugly I am rude I have no talents or skills I am lazy and apathetic I am not funny or smart and I have no social skills at all.And somehow despite this there are people who love me and I know that if I were to try to kill myself that their lives would be hurt by that and I just cannot bring myself to do that to them especially since I know how truly hard life has been for them lately I do not want to add to that.I feel so ungrateful for feeling this way here I am surrounded by family who are truly good and loving people I have such an easy life where I am provided for and safe and yet I still feel like this. I am such a drama queen and I hate it.I have been told to focus on what I enjoy but the things I enjoy are getting less and less enjoyable and even when I can find joy in something what is the point when I know I am just going to cycle back into feeling like shit?I am truly and utterly worthless and I honestly do not think I have a future beyond being a parasite to everyone who knows me until inevitably they start to hate me. I wish that I would just get hit by a bus or get stabbed by some random stranger then I can escape without my family blaming themselves for not doing anything to help me because there truly is not anything they can do to help me.I do not know why I wrote this I guess because I want pity and some sort of magical piece of advise that will turn my whole life around and then I will be able to see the beauty in living that other people seem so well acquainted with.But I know that will not happen because in the end the problem is me and I do not think I will ever be able to fix that. There truly is no escape for me I just have to sit around and wait for this pathetic life to finally end. I 18F feel trapped in life.,Depression
37994,my world ha been falling apart for a decade i ve finally hit the bottom i need someone to talk to real bad anybody i m cry in an empty teamspeak atm opening apps hoping to see someone,Depression

17949,I have started to struggle with completing routine tasks especially those that have deadlines. Somedays I want to work and I set a schedule for myself though I always fail at following it. Time management is something I have become incapable of. I have been extremely depressed before even had suicidal thoughts but time management was never an issue. I was extremely satisfied with myself in January and thought I fought the depression I had in 2019. Time seems to fly away I do not know where it goes. It keeps running away and its going faster and faster. Sometimes I struggle to get out of bed staring at the same feed on my phone over and over again EVEN IF I am FEELING CONTENT THAT DAY. Another aspect I have noticed is that I am chasing excitement thrill. And without that life seems completely boring and I cannot even seem to get up from my bed. I get excited whenever I buy something even if it is completely useless. btw I just remembered I need to take out money for the book I ordered I eat a lot. I want to eat all the time I keep on wasting and ordering food. This food problem is getting out of hand because I already have strict definitions of what body type I should have rooted in my brain. I just spent 30 minutes on a food delivery app trying to order something even though I am not that hungry. I kept searching for Baskin Robbins even though I knew it was closed. I keep on opening the fridge even though I know there is nothing inside. Somedays I lose all ambition completely but usually I have long term goals which I always keep failing at I am extremely unlucky. There is something against me even the smallest tasks I attempt become increasingly difficult and an array of problems pop up out of nowhere. Today I did not get out of bed for 6 hours straight. I am writing this rant that probably no one is going to bother reading because I have nothing better to do with my life. cannot even find new music that is good and the thought of which would get me excited to go through the day. I do not have any friends there are people I would text and meet but now I have grown distant to them too. I do not meet anyone I only text a couple of people on and off. None of them were my real friends anyways they were just there to make this journey bearable for sometime.P.S. I was diagnosed with depression unofficially by a local clinical psychologist last year just before COVID spread. I was way more content during lockdown and even more so when life began to get normalized after it. Everything is currently normal in my country so all this is not an effect of a lockdown. I have never felt like this before could it be depression in one of its forms?,Depression

40359,a man in my neighborhood just killed himself in the same method i am planning it happened a month ago but i just got more detail about it today from my mom she doesn t suspect a thing about me all the story i have heard about when something like this happens is that people rally together but that didn t happen my mom talked about his poor wife and how much his kid are going to miss him and how it must have been some of the medication he wa on she didn t say a thing about him other than it wa sad that he had mental health issue the people in my circle think that people like me and him are worth le than someone healthy they never said that but i can tell they think people like me are hard to love that we have too many demon inside of u that people with depression are letting the devil get to them none of this ha escaped me am i really evil am i letting the devil win the worst part is that they don t know what i m planning to do but i could never say anything because i don t want to hurt them i don t want to destroy the image they have of me while i am alive,Depression

40907,if your own brand of depression make you bring your mum to the timeline for public flogging it s not depression that is plaguing you it is just plain old foolishness your whole operating system is corrupted and need a total overhaul,Depression
9930,So let me first start by saying this I am grateful for what I have and I know that there are people that have less than me that have nothing and have already lost their lives. And I really wish that all of that factual evidence depleted every ounce of sadness and depression and anger that I have built up in my body and soul. I am a 21yearold black girl from European dissent I have three brothers and one sister. I am blessed enough to live in a two parent household with parents that guide and watch over me very closely. At nature I try to believe that I have a very strong personality and that I am a very strong person. But in the past couple of months I have never felt more of an urge to be suicidal or because harm to myself then I have in the past two years. From 19 to 21 has been a absolute horror. I have gone through so much emotional stress I am pretty sure that I am clinically depressed I have been dealing with it on my own for a very long time now. I know my mindset is very dangerous I am such a talented and strong and smart individual I often times get disappointed with myself for wanting to end my life. But my depression and sadness is so overwhelming at times no matter what people say things never get better. Not to mention my family does not necessarily see the reasons for my distress. So fixated on my ever gleaming future they seem to forget that I have been sitting in the same spot for the past two years depressed lonely I always wondered what it would be like to have sleeping problems but I guess now I know. If this is hard now why would I want to continue life so it can get harder I train physically to try and give myself something to focus on and now that is not even enough I am being ridiculed for being too muscular I cannot find a boyfriend because I am too intimidating and lonely I have no friends well none that are genuine anyway and that upsets me because I am a genuine person and they say the remedy to all of this is time but I do not want to wait any longer. I do not think I can Last straw,Depression
23162,I know thisll pass but being here really does suck. The moments I cannot escape I feel everyday those chances are getting slimmer. I have to force it.these negative thoughts do not define me but without them I am nothing. Before I was sick all I ever did was run awaysick or nothing..atleast there is no pain It only felt good to run away,Depression
37747,now i cant go work in the hospital and enjoy the little fucking thing i do and learn there an all the people i like talking to and i got ta be stuck here for a week with a busted ankle who i dont even know if it will work properly again or not anymore either this year get better or idk but im just tired of every fucking bad this happening to me all the time i thought i wa finally gon na have a job and a boyfriend and turn out the guy doesnt even like me and the manager never called me again at least i wish i had someone that loved me he could come visit and we could talk all night long at this point i really need some cuddle at least,Depression
18339,What the title says... assume that meds like Prozac are not an option for me. Has anyone here found success in figuring out how to stop it from happening and ruining their lives... with the power of some other force besides medication? Greatly appreciated if you do not try to convince me to take them. Thanks ya'll. Is there a way to stop ruminating on negative thoughts without meds?,Depression
39232,i wa fine for a year or so and then the anxiety come back worse than ever panic attack in the evening which make me feel like shit i feel so fucking bad inside of my chest and stomach and my thought don t stop rushing in the day and morning i m fine but in the evening i feel like i m losing my mind and i want everything to just be ok but how will i live with myself i m generally healthy i work out i do breathing exercise but nothing help and it fucking suck school actually calm anxiety because i have a task and i m busy but when i m home i feel so fucking lonely,Depression
47153,I wish my brain would leave me alone Just stop with the negative thoughts and feelings. Just leave my mind in peace for once. Leave me alone.,Depression
11880,Hello guys I am here to make a rant about my work culture and having confusion for my future.I work as a account cum admin clerk at a hardware shop. A 85 job on Monday to Friday and Saturday from 83. My work used to be just doing paperwork and giving assistance to my supervisors. Making receipts to customersmaking payment to supplier filing documents and so on. On the last few weeks my job workload increased a lot my supervisor and boss keep calling us to do counter sales job because they are being too busy making delivery orders and invoiceor should I say my boss is does not want to hire new people even though we are understaffed.At first I am fine but when it goes on and on I realized I had no time for own work and started feeling burnout every day.Every morning when I woke up I literally had anxiety going for my job. I keep stressing out about things they are going to go wrong in my work environment and having fear going to work simply because I am just too tired waking up every morning stressing out over the same thing over and over again in order to satisfy this company's lust and needs.My boss also keep adding work to me which includes calling me to learn POS system because he wanted the counter sales more selfsufficient and making sure the money in drawer is tally with our system. But I know nothing about the system I try to ask my colleagues about the POS system and no one wanted to help me with it they are all selfish people who just want to complete their own job without being bother by other people. I do not know is this the chinese culture or not but every senior in my office seems to be lazy and do not want to care a bunch about others people work even though they are supervisor of their position. This is not included in my job descriptions when I first entered the company and makes me felt puzzled it too.My boss also wanted me to create a KPI system for the company in order to maintain good work ethics and making sure everybody voice got heard. But from what I know and see that this company workers have frequent complain over the years but my boss just would not care a thing so I exactly do not know what this kpi system is for and I had no time for doing it also.I had think about quitting the job more than a few times already but I am afraid I cannot find another job because of it.I am just a 20 years old male where I had no chance going to college Because my family is not rich and they also having a concept of only work will makes you Rich instead of studyMy mum being a little bit considerate saying that even though you want to go to college who going to pay for your college fees?I am kind of puzzled now for my future I saw all my friends having a plan and a target in their life. But when I look at myself I felt like I do not know anything about life. Sometimes I really wondered what is our existence in this world. Just a rant,Depression
13606,i am a fat ugly piece of shit who makes the same mistakes. And NOBODY cares about me. i hate myself,Depression
22709,Why cannot I just be alright with myself dude I am so fucking done hiding my shit with humor and self deprecation this is fucked up. TLDR I hate myself and am annoyed by it I am sick of hating myself,Depression
11200,I moved to his country a year ago after I finished my education Msc in computer science. it is really on the countryside and it turned out that there is zero need for my skill set. Nobody here cares about software they do not know what they should put me to and everyone tells me to just work with something else. After applying for jobs and being in a foreign country for eight months hearing about how I should work with something else than software the depression hit like a hammer. I have take a software job now in my home country and I am going to move back in two months. But right now those two months feel like....... Never ending. I love my bf deeply but I honestly do not know what I am saying anymore. I just want to get away. I want to be alone so I do not hurt him more. I just say something. I say sorry even I do not truly mean it because I know that is what I am supposed to say. I say I do not care about your mother or your family and I do not care about how you feel. it is completely fucked up. I am shocked about myself saying these words when I think back. Everyday I am angry at him everyday something is wrong everyday is negativity. Yet he is just loving and caring. I just do not feel anything. Everything is numb. I cry all the time. His family is here at the moment and everyone can clearly see I am fucked up. Next week we are travelling to see my family and it is going to be the same What happened to her?How do I survive those two months? I feel like the light is when I start to work and move back in two months. But how do I show affection to him? How do I keep this relationship going? I love him. I just hate this place. he is willing to move later on he just cannot now. I F29 treat my bf M29 like shit because of my depression,Depression
24745,I have been panicking and freaking out for the whole week because I have been feeling like the world is moving on without me. Of course my depression only has one idea of a solution and that is killing myself. I know there are solutions beyond this but I feel so helpless and lacking control lately and I do not know what to do. I go through periods of time where I get depressed and feel hollow and I am going through one right now and I wish it would be my last dead or alive. The world is moving on without me,Depression
14955,I just want someone genuine in my life. I am tired of dealing with shitty people with no moral integrity. People are fucking horrible. Do good people even exist anymore?,Depression
38840,about a year ago i started getting anxious when i heard people yelling it doesn t happen when i m being yelled at only when it s other people arguing or sometimes even just loud talking even if it s isn t fighting it s gotten much worse to the point of me shaking and cry when i hear yelling i don t understand it i don t have much of a past with yelling a far a i know so i m not sure why this could be happening especially so suddenly there isn t much i can do to stop people from yelling because no one listens when i say it make me anxious and my only way to really block it out is loud music which i can t always have but i feel like at least knowing what could be causing this would help me feel at least a bit more normal understood if anyone know what this could be caused by or anything that could ease it even in the slightest bit maybe a form of music or something else please share it with me i d be very grateful also i don t have access to a therapist currently a mine just moved and i didn t get much time to talk to her about it,Depression

22878,A few months ago I would be making yet another post on this subreddit. I was at my lowest. To get to that point of my life the point of my life where I literally wanted to end it I had years of social isolation an adolescence scarred and stolen from me by bullying that left me with PTSD and being too scared to leave my own fucking house being diagnosed with aspergers and depression put on medication and coming literally to the edge of life and death. And you know what? I survived. I am a survivor. I have come to the realisation that there literally is nothing left in life that can frighten me. No height too high. No space too small. No flight too bumpy. No bully too big. I fear nothing but fear itself. The thing that has scared me the most? My emotions. Being so traumatised so low that I felt I had nothing to live for. Has anything changed? Not really. I still have no friends. I am still a confused screwed up teen well young adult I am 18 now who'se still yet to experience anything you would expect from someone that age still unemployed and still just as restless as ever. But what has changed? I embraced the mindset of a survivor. I stopped viewing myself as a victim. That is not to say I am a victim. I have been treated horiffically an outcast by the society around me for my entire adolesence. But if I can survive years of loneliness being bullied relentless for months on end effectively imprisoned for fear of being attacked when I went out night upon night of waking up in pools of sweat reliving the terror I experienced or might experience in the future being on the edge of life and death I can survive anything. This is the only positive thing I have posted on here. Probably one of the few positive things on here. My advice? Stop reading or posting on this subreddit until you are in a better place. it is filled with very angry very desperate and sad people like how I was and let us face it I still have days like that wallowing in an echo chamber where their worthlessness is projected to thousands of other likeminded people who believe that they too are equally worthless. If things have got that bad in your life that you thought about ending it and you did not then you are a survivor too. everyone is pain tolerance threshold is different and if you did not give into that voice that told you you were better of dead you have survived. My journey has only just begun. I am not sure where exactly the road I am on is taking me but hopefully it is somewhere better than the place I have been at for the last several months. It might be a long sometimes bumpy ride but I will get there. One way or the other. Because I am a survivor. I am a survivor.,Depression
39029,every single day at school during my rd period i get very nervous for my th period and my stomach start to ache badly it s like there are gas in my stomach and i get very gassy i think i get nervous because i start thinking about this girl i m very intimidated by but i wouldn t think that it would make me this anxious and then in my rd period i have to go to the washroom to do number two and it s usually diarrhea and that happens every single day in rd period no matter what i do to try to calm myself nothing seems to work i tried breathing pattern but i just get nervous again maybe it s because i eat lunch before rd period but it s every single day that my stomach is aching is it normal to feel this way i don t know if i should do something about it,Depression
13063,I am subpar at everything that I do. Even when I practice really hard to try and Improve I end up worse than when I started. I feel like I have to try really hard just to be average at anything. I have severe work anxiety because I can barely hold a conversation and work colleagues think I am being lazy when I am actually trying my hardest!I feel like every time I manage to take a step forward I just end up two steps back. I cannot find the words to describe how hopeless this makes me feel. Not good enough,Depression

24706,I decided to take a break recently from my family.My family situation has been shit. My sister is a single parent using the title as a shield to defend her shitty ability and her son's behavior is deplorable.My mom enables her and everything they do deprives the child of emotional growth. My brother and his wife have stopped interacting with her and by extension my parents also.I lost it on my mom the other day when she chose to just make my brother and I's old toys disappear when he was not around instead of talking to my nephew about it. My sister is downsizing the amount of garbage she left in my parents house and she is using the same tactics. Just throw them in bags while he is not around.I am fucking disgusted with their actions. I have been staying at my friend's mom's house that is empty at the moment but it just fucking sucks.No job. No school. No family. My only opportunity's are abroad and those countries are still closed due to covid.I am supposed to hang out with my brother this weekend at his birthday dinner and the following day a BBQ but I just do not want to be there in my mother's presence.I am so fucking angry at that woman for doing what she did to me growing up and I do not want anything to do with her anymore. I feel like she wanted to cripple me so I could never leave. Fuck That. Fuck Her. I do not know if this is the right sub but fuck am I lonely right now and angry and depressed. do not do anything stupid,Depression

47968,Im having such a hard timw with sleeping Like my sleeping habits have started to make my life feel worse. Usually I cant sleep until 3am most of the time it takes longer. I do like 12 all nighters a week. Whenever I do one i start to hear this whistling. A melody. Every morning I have an alarm and I automatically turn it off while sleeping. I cant get a hold on my sleeping habits. Melatonin doesnt work,Depression
39626,i realized the only reason i haven t killed myself is i don t want to be a burden on my brother and cause him and harm idk realizing that made me freak the fuck out the idea that i haven t lived my life for myself for year is making me have the urge again for some reason and it s scaring me the only thing that give me comfort is planning a day to end it so i don t end it now i really don t want to be here anymore i feel like people only want me around when it s convenient for them or when i can help them i am a last resort for everyone because i have no need at all i fucking hate myself and the only people who care about me are the people who have to this is stupid but it wa cathartic to write lmao,Depression

20940,I am completely lost at this point. I finished school got a diploma in hospitality management and realised it was a complete waste and have no interest in that industry anymore. Now I am 20 floating around minimum wage jobs lost af. I just feel like time is running out and am heading nowhere in life. I do not know what career I want to do and am to scared to take the jump. I feel like there are infinite paths infront of me and each lead somewhere but I am to scared I will pick the wrong one like I did with hospo. I tell myself I am trying to take it slow and figure it out so I do not rush into anything bad But doing nothing makes me feel so empty and voided. Expecicialy that most people around me have some career there working towards. Completely lost in life at 20years old,Depression

17930,My life has been the same for so long. I wake up I play games inside I go to bed. I am so so sick of this. Is this just going to be my life until I turn 18? Nobody around here is my age and I usually do not have anything to do outside but I cannot just keep doing this anymore. I am tired of being lazy I am tired of staying inside I am tired of not doing anything and being demotivated as hell. But I do not know what to do anymore. All I do is wait. Waiting for what exactly? You tell me I do not know what to do.,Depression
18224,I have been having shitty weeks lately. Nothings going my way I can never see the light at the end of the tunnel and I am just not happy anymore. The workload keeps piling up at work. Its just endless amounts of work and I cannot seem to catch up. Not only that I have been wanting to hangout with one of my favorite coworkers but he keeps blowing me off. that is the one thing I liked to do and I just wanted to blow off steam and shoot the shit with him but he just keeps blowing me off and canceling on me. I have been asking like a week in advance to do something he oks it then suddenly he randomly invites someone else and they take over basically ruining everything for me. Then this weekend is not good how about next weekend? Next weekend comes and its still not good. Any shred of hope and happiness that I barely have gets taken away from me. Its not just hanging out with my coworker its like I said work. I get happy for a split second and I think I am almost at the top then I get knocked down. I think I am going to blow off steam with my coworker and he keeps canceling on me. He probably never wants to hangout again but whatever. I do not care. Am I that awfulannoying to the point where he does not want to hangout anymore?? I considered him an older brothermentorbest friend. Not so much anymore. My life has been so shitty lately that I got a slight injury last Saturday and did not start feeling better until yesterday. I could have gone to work but I just did not feel like it. That place depresses me and my coworker is not helping. I was already feeling down and I thought that maybe my coworker and I could hangout like we used to. I was really looking forward to it. Nothing was set in stone but it felt like this weekend would have been a good one. But I guessed wrong. I hate my life and and I just wish I could go away and never come back!! I know I have other friends and coworkers to hangout with but I have different relationships with different people everybody does so that is why its disappointing when someone you thought you were close to blows you off and is basically meh and cold towards you. I need a fucking vacation or something. I am just over feeling down and depressed. I hate it!! The one person that thought I clicked really well with is just been so off and distant with me. My life is just one big disappointment after another,Depression
47444,Working nights is killing me Anyone with me? I get home at 1am and Im wide awake and its totally normal for me I dont mind it but it really hurts the rest of my life,Depression
47219,I'm sick and tired of this bullshit I can't tell anyone else so I'll say it hereI have no particular circumstantial problems traumas etc in life yet I feel like absolute shit. I feel like I'm cutting myself just to shoehorn myself into a community and feel like I have a problem so that I can blame all my shortcomings and failures on that mY dEpReSsIoN instead of owning them up like a normal functioning adult and improving. But noooooo I waste everything I have all the resources at my disposal and its funny because I actually am disposing them down the drain lmao. I am just acting things out in this elaborate drama I have constructed for myself so that I can feel like a victim of my own imagination make up problems where there aren't any and poach resources away from those actually suffering. You know I sometimes take a blade to my hand but I get scared. I get terrified that probably is a primal instinct. That definitely means I am faking it all right. If I really hated myself and wanted to kms I'd be able to sink it deeper with no regards to the pain. But noooo all I can do is barely see the white. Because if I was really wanted to kms I'd have something to show for it. If I'm really suffering I should've been able to cut deeper just to deal with the emotional pain that I apparently have. But wait I can't slideanddice deeper if everything in my life is all fine and dandy yeah that's right. I'm a fraud. I can't so that clearly shows I'm not in pain. can't even get a drop out. I'm a fucking fraud How do people do it. Deal with the pain and just slice away down deeper. I wanna be able to do it. I'm fake as fuck. Man why am I so pathetic fucking failure of an adult at 25 goddamnit,Depression

48197,Support and advice greatly needed 26 year old female sorry for the long post Ive been on anti depressants for about the last 12 years of my life. I was always on 100 mg zoloft amp then switched to 20 mg lexapro in 2018 but went off of them for about 6 months in 2021 to try to live without them. At the end of those 6 months I started to get dizzy more often amp have what I can only describe as uncontrollable thoughts. Not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone but I just did not feel in control of my emotions and I felt like I was gonna lose my mind lol amp very depressed. So I got back on lexapro 20 mg amp after a few months I started to feel average at best but better than before. August 2022 I started to get brain zapsdizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start. I worked my way up to 75mg amp started to feel a lottttt better but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since. Very dizzy lots of anxiety amp panic attacks and the weird uncontrollable emotionsthoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since. It gets A LOT worse at night and thats when most of my issues arise.Within the last 6 months Ive seen an ear doctor to make sure I didnt have inner ear issues causing dizziness an eye exam I got a small prescription mostly for being on my phonecomputer or reading and I got an MRI done and saw a neurologist. All has always come back normal so Im thinking its a medication issue or lack of something. Im mostly looking for advice or comfort to make me feel better since Im not doing well lol. Thanks for reading ,Depression
9195,Hello fellow redditors I myself have depression issues but this post is not really just about me. I have been with a woman for a while who can be the most wonderful woman on the planet. I love her very much and I would do anything to see her happy or smile. There is an issue that has been persistent throughout our relationship though and that is her depression.She has tried many different medications and there are ups and downs. Unfortunately when it strikes she becomes extremely cold and cruel. She walks away from me mid conversation locks herself in the bedroom tells me to go away not touch her calls me names says cruel things about me creates fabrications and refuses to get out of bed and try to do anything to help her depression. She frequently tells me to leave her when in this state and that I would be better off without her.Once the spell is over she is back to her happy Loving self with cuddles and kisses and words of affirmation.Now I understand that these things are related to depression but my concern is the outright toxic behavior. She says that it is because her depression makes her push people away but I am starting to question if this is actually depression or just an excuse to be toxic.I understand I could have posted this on relationship advice and I might also do that but the reason I am posting it here is to get insight from people that have and are sympathetic to depression. Any insight is greatly appreciated. Depression or toxic?,Depression

25220,it is the middle of the night 000 and I cannot sleep because I feel awful. The last few years of my life have been a disaster one bad thing happening after the other. I feel hated by people in society and I feel like my life does not matter at all. I wish humans had more value in their own eyes and I wish we helped each other and listened to each other more. The world would be such a better place if we did that.I am tired of having to stand up for myself and I am tired of fighting this pointless battle. Nobody should have to do that. I am tired of crying every time something bad happens and I am tired of just being here. HUMAN BEINGS HAVE VALUE and I do too. I am NOT LESS THAN ANYBODY OR ANYTHING and I deserve better. And so do all of you. I am so depressed it is insane,Depression

8023,IWTL how to lose weight yesterday I posted this on the IWTL sub and today I took the peoples advice from the sub and started my weight loss journey. I did some exercises for today and after I was done I sat down with a healthy breakfast. As soon as I sat in front of the tv to eat my mom taunted me So you started exercising today? I said Yeah. She suddenly told all my family that Ime was not going to eat any butter or pasta or any junk food. I did not respond at all because I am used to her being that way and you cannot really reason with unreasonable people. Then she proceeded to say that she will order pasta and some noodles and was staring at my face. My mom has been my first bully and has never understood me and so has the rest of my family. I love the foods she mentioned and she knows that I am insecure about myself and I will have to resist myself a great deal if she orders that. My little sister 18 chimed in and added to all this. She said she would also order things for her to eat. All the junk food imaginable. And all of them waited to see how did I react. I did not react and pretended like this did not happen. This is a pattern now every time I try to improve they react very very negatively I feel like shit at my house. I do not know what to do. I started my self improvement and weight loss journey today and my family absolutely brought me down.,Depression

26140,Since I was a teenager I have always experienced depressive episodes. I did not know what they were until my late teensearly 20s when I started feeling suicidal and made a few attempts on my life. I have used drugs and alcohol to cope for many yearsnot to the point of being considered an addict but those are only temporary fixes. I have seen professionals and have been medicated but I never feel comfortable enough to discuss my true feelings and lack the ability to verbalize many of my thoughts. I am doing better in life than I was a few years ago but recently I have found myself unable to do many things I have always loved cannot watch movies or listen to music like I used. Ill sit in the dark and look at my phone for hours. It has also affected my professional growth as I am unable to make the time to learn new skills or work a little harder than I usually do. My selfesteem is pretty shot and I have self depreciating thoughts constantly. At this point I am afraid Ill never be happy again. Mental health,Depression

18029,Long story shot last Thursday I had a panic attack because I let myself get drowned be the fear of dying and I saw myself ceasing to exist and never being here again. It was so awful I ended up with a lot of consequences1. Vivid Hallucinations of everyone dying even actors on TV2. Constant fear of dying and experiencing death3. Everything around me is a reminder of death 4. Fear of seeing TV actors will die listening music singers are death social media old profile pictures of people are a reminder they are now closer to death fear of spending time.I have started going to therapy antidepressants and anxiolytics.Before that event I used to enjoy my days found meaning in everything was ready to face death worked hard in myself and in my job. I too have friends and a gf. However recently I cannot find meaning in anything I am just performing actions when I can without any glimpse of enthusiasm. My head resorts to you are going to die and everyone else also there is no point.I looked myself in the mirror and my mind told me in a couple of years there is going to be no reflection you will not exist.And while I am constantly being bombarded by this and feeling down I am also thinking that I do not want to keep on this life if I have to see my loved ones go one by one. Thanks for reading. I feel no meaning in anything because in the end everyone I love will die me included.,Depression
18347,I am a Political Science graduate who had not used my degree to full capacity because in my country this is just a prelaw degree with nothing much to offer unless you proceed to law school. I do not want to become a lawyer in the first place I just took this course since I was pretty much undecided as to what career I really wanted to have in life back then.After graduating at 20 years old I was pretty much clueless. I am just taking whatever exams available and although I passed all of the exams that I took but I never got to use them at all.I enrolled in law school but quit after 1 month because its not my passion.I passed the exams to be qualified as a policeman but never entered the police corps because I had myself a tattoo before I even knew that I passed.Now I am 25 years old and spent the last 2 years as assistant in our family business. I thought I had a career going for me as successor to the family business until yesterday at my parents reunion with their former colleagues and friends.I drove my parents to the venue of their reunion. My parents introduced me to their friends and soon after they talked about career and work. My dads friends kept bragging about their sons and daughters and how their parenting produced IT experts licensed engineers nurse psychologists doctors ship captains etc.I saw how my parents looked worried about not having to brag to their friends that their only son at 25 still had no work experience outside of family business and just lived off a small apartment owned by my parents.Conclusion I really fked up my life. If I could just turn back time and choose a more practical degree I might have a professional career already like the sons and daughters of my parents friends. But here I am trying to learn and manage a family business because what other options do I have? If I refuse to manage our family business and my parents die or something I am nothing. Knowledge in business is the only advantage I have left in trying to compete with these young professionals. Most of the time my contributions would go unnoticed which have led to my present state of hopelessness. 25 no work experience felt like its too late to start over again and fix the mess I did back when I was still a bad decision maker.,Depression
38256,i feel so sad and lonely so i am a student at a university now i am an international student and i came to this country last year i am kind of shy and always chose to keep the feeling to myself than speak out there wa one girl in my class that i liked she wa smart and intelligent rather than anything romantic i thought we could be friend but i did not approach her till the end of the semester on one of the final day i wa like i can t always be scared to express so i went upto her and asked her contact detail we talked a bit and she asked if i wan na go for a movie we went the next week and it wa fun it wa a good to have a friend in a foreign country we went out a few time after that a well then she had covid and i tried to give her some advice and said that i wa stifling her even though i had just told her to take care of herself the next day she said that she ha issue that she need to sort out and want space being a friend i didn t understand what issue or what did i do but i did not message her a week later she message me back in a good mood and say that let s watch something and we watch a movie at her home i cook for her at her place and i think she enjoyed a well she doe some painting and showed me those so i asked are these just for you and then she said that she shared it on instagram by her pseudonym and feel good when her internet friend appreciate it i did not read too much into what internet friend meant day later i wa scrolling through instagram when it occurred to me to look her painting up so i searched her pseudonym and found that it wa a public profile and saw that she had posted a painting i like it so i messaged her on whatsapp where we usually chatted that hey i saw your painting and what i liked about it something flipped her off and she said that her internet persona is different than the real life persona and what i did wa a big mistake and she doe not want to talk anymore i wa like i did not about this internet persona thing and you had said you shared it with your friend but if it is that big an issue i am sorry and will not look at your painting and then she wa so rude she said that it wa the last chance she gave me but me explaining why i looked wa too much i did not respond anything a i wa so hurt i did not even do anything bad or something to intentionally hurt her i did not message her anything for week i did not look at her whatsapp i just tried to forget her around day ago in a moment of weakness i searched her name and see that she ha blocked me on whatsapp i didn t even do anything after she said all that i got very depressed and wrote her a long message on text this wa the message hello please read this that is my only request yesterday i had tried to message you on whatsapp asking how you were and saw that you have blocked me you can block me here and everywhere else a well after this i just want you to read what wa in my mind when we were talking from the day we had started talking i do not know what all bad thing you think about me but atleast from my side i had always wanted to be a good friend and never had any bad thought i had fun on each of our meeting i have been continuously thinking for the last month what did i do wrong a you never told me and just shut me off maybe these were the reason i don t even know i can t even think properly i thought that we were very alike i honestly thought we could be good friend two introvert who want to be better at their craft and helping each other out through tough school again i do not know what all notion you had about my intention but i did not want to be more than friend if you ever felt that way i am a new guy in this country there are many thing i have not even understood here having a relationship or a girlfriend is the last thing on my mind i don t even have friend here to share stuff so i never wanted anything more than just being friend who could help each other whenever they needed or share thing about life course maybe take some advice on what to do in certain aspect of life thing that normal friend do and maybe i wa selfish to have looked for that friend in you you had said that i did not deserve to be a friend the last time we talked there ha not been a day when i did not think what did i do wrong that i am not even worth a friendship i think that i had probably messaged you more than what you wanted a a friend i don t know you never told me that i thought everything wa normal whenever something came to my mind or i watched some video that i liked on youtube i used to send it to you i think i should not have done that and maybe you didn t like that i just did that because i wanted to share thing with you that i admired so that those thing may bring happiness to you a well the other reason wa that i looked at your painting on instagram i am sorry that i looked at your instagram profile to appreciate your painting i did not have any wrong intention i wa just curious and had thought you would like it a you had said that you like it when your friend appreciate your art i wa not aware of internet persona being different from real life persona i am not a bad person i just wanted to be a friend and someone you could trust i am not writing this to you for any response or for being friend because i don t think i have any respect in your eye and i have lost much of my self respect in my own eye after how many time i have tried to apologize honestly for last week i didn t even look for you on whatsapp a it wa soul crushing to read how you had said that i blew the chance of being a friend and i think it is best that you do not respond to me a i can not feel more pathetic and worse about myself trying to mend the bridge which never even existed i just want to say that i am sorry if i ever hurt you or made you feel bad i always wanted to be good and make you happy a a friend i never had any malice or any bad intention i never wanted to be someone who you despise this much i am just sorry and i will be really grateful if you could just let me know what i did i texted her this and and then she texted back don t say if own up to your mistake and now she will block me in text a well i am not even sure what i did and i feel depressed lonely and sad i have never felt like this,Depression
18995,And it did not even feel genuine. I want to cry like really bad. I just want to cry. I want to be able to express myself but there is no one else to express myself to. So lonely.I started working out recently and have been trying to find motivation through doing so. I get through everything but at the end I just feel a wave of dissatisfaction. Why? Like cannot I just feel something other than disappointment and selfhatred for once. I think this passing few months my mental health has taken a nosedive. I have thought about ways to kill myself and I have planned out scenarios in my mind in intricate details I never thought I would be able to. I am too scared to go through with any of them because I do not want to make my parents sad but if I died right here right now of some freak accident out of my control I am down for it. Yeah last time I cried I remember it was not even tears rolling down the eyes. It was not genuine. It was more sympathy than anything. This sucks I think I can change sometimes but I never do. Nothing has changed for the better these past 3 years. The only time I cried was 4 years ago,Depression
11138,I am a female 18 and I am in depression for almost 4 years. I feel extremely uncomfortable with my parents. they are everything I could ever wish for but still i feel very unhappy when I am with them. Does anyone feel like this too?I think to myself that I am happy but I somehow feel insignificant to my family and the world. I cannot sleep at night properly and not be happy about anything. I was once admitted in the hospital because of panic and anxiety attack. Also had extreme stress. My parents then told me to stop studying a lot. I always feel like they make a better family without me.My feelings and their rude words that comes out of their mouth unintentionally makes me even more sadder. My head pains too much and I cannot stop crying. I am worth but not to the extent of others in this world.My family is very sweet and happy. My mother is a temperamental person and is always angry. She blames me for not doing anything as she is scared of my elder sister and blaming her and shouting at her will lead to her reciprocating the same. My sister is adamant and very much like I am what I am I do what I want to...kind of person. She sleeps all day and night and watches movies on her computer lying on the bed. While I study all day to improve my grades. Studying has become a escape route for me. I also started watching other entertainment like k and bl series as I have never been into movies. My whole family just sits and watches movies as everyone in my house are just attached to the tv. My mother still shouts at me for not doing dishes improper working or just simply for random stuff. She also came to know I watch kpop does not know I watch bl lol and started to nag at me. My father is quiet and just asks me to do tasks.. Repeatedly again and again that I get so bored of it and just leave my work to do it. My mother would still shout at me for doing the task. If I mention it was dad who asked me to do so she would just scold me anyway. My sister will dump all her chores to me too. My mother is very unfair between us too and my sister.Sometimes they would all be in the same room teasing and shaming me while I just fake laugh everything.This is not everything. The thing that pains the most is when they act like nothing happened when others visit our house or something like that. They say I am the best and my sis is equally great and that we study and live great and just like life is perfect is every sense! My sister also likes to cajole and kiss me like a child though I mentioned countless of times that I hate it. She says I am the beautiful person she has ever seen. My mother also agrees to it as she just listens to everything my sis says.The fake mask I wear in front of everyone is starting to pain. I smile at everyone and make everyone laugh till they cry while I am always crying deep inside my heart.I hate that in a place like home I cannot be myself. I am yet to call it a home it is always just a house to me. I just want someone to understand and be with me Ps. Just while I was writing this my mom just shouted at me for making tea just for me and not for them. My family...,Depression

I do not feel the pleasures of this earth i feel no purpose as if one is watering a dead flower hoping and praying that it will bloom. It sucks being diagnosed for major depressive disorder and being bi polar. I have been on medication for about 2 years now and nothing has change you get episodes that lasts for weeks. Almost died for about 5 times already and still i am here. Still suffering. I starter going back to church re establishing my faith opening my heart out go god but its still nothing.

I need help but I am too embarrassed to go. Then I hate myself more and feel ashamed of how pathetic I am.I have alopecia that started from a particularly bad year.

22821,The career I chose is in the process of making me very rich but also extremely depressed and overworkedoverjudged to the point that I am having at least one episode a day where I want to curl up and disappear. Its a job that involves social media fame and the expectation of perfection. Sometimes I am not sure how much more I can handle as a human being before I break. I have not been able to make any real friends my family was never there to begin with my relationship was with someone who cared more about my pursuit of this than my own wellbeing people respect my name but almost daily disrespect my person if that makes sense and people are always watching what I do so I have to be so extremely careful that it almost feels like PTSD now. Most people around me want something out of me. I am also constantly comparing my body and myself to the next best thing because that is the type of industry I am in. Its mentally draining. I would not wish fame on anyone.I wanted to see if anyone out there has any advice for me? I am going to therapy but I am still having these super depressive episodes . I have a lot of regret of pursuing what I once loved so much because of everything I have had to sacrifice for success. Words of advice for the successful depressed?,Depression

20678,I do not want to give you all some BS motivation say you can do it or life is hard. I want to give you guys a story of mine.I am not going to bore anyone with details but from a young age I was basically physically tortured as a child. I thought it was all normal until one night I had a major epiphany on an acid tripdeep conversation at 6 am.After this realization I became majorly depressed. No money no friends no energy no thoughts and just drugs.I spent a month in my dorm room freshmen year doing absolutely nothing. I slept 12 hours a day 9 am to 9 pm. Pissed in bottles to avoid leaving my room ate 1 sandwich a day got high and listened to music. I did not care about anything. I eventually moved back in with my parents stayed depressed for another 5 months stayed in school worked and eventually graduated. I now live with my gf and our dog. I still have some issues but nothing I cannot handle.I just want to let everyone know that story and I hope everyone finds their own way. Tell your story here and I will read it with a genuine reply because I know what it is like. It never goes away it is a cycle that keeps us awake some nights.For those of you that are in the situation that I was in try to do 1 or 2 things a day that are good for you. Whether it is brushing your teeth or eating one more meal than normal.. lt3 Depression Community Story.. sparking hope?,Depression

18132,I am not asking for much but being able to survive without fancy possessions and just exist without living under a bridge or overpass.

20506,I have been struggling with my mental health for a few years and have made very little headway in finding a way out. I suspect it is more complex than simply depression however I am continually being let down by the NHS mental healthcare and am prepared to go private. I have decided it would be appropriate to acquire a diagnosis so I can try to undergo therapy or medication that may be more suitable to whatever it is I am dealing with. Could anyone recommend any good psychiatrists or anyone else who is trained to diagnose mental health conditions in the East Midlands area of the UK? Good psychiatrists in the UK East Midlands,Depression
23651,When you truly dislike your face... its just annoying to live. Like I hate going out in public or going for a run. Most people think they are unattractive when they simply are not. Me on the other hand. You do not know me so do not say ' bEaUty iS suBjeCtIve' . My face looks like a bloated moon face. No way in hell anyone attractive will like me so I have been looking into Buddhism to try and detach from women. Honestly have not felt that lonely lately but damn.. I am embarrassed whenever I go. Not because I care what others think. I want to be happy in my own skin. My body is nice ish when I workout alot I have been complimented but my face UGH. I wish I could change it. I look like an 11 year old when I am 21. Smh. I hate how I cannot change my face,Depression

I never feel full and food gives me comfort. I have a relatively fit person who has never experienced this before. I would usually just not give in to the wants and cravings and could drop pounds if I felt like it. I have done one meal a day for a while because I am a tiny person and one meal will more than meet my calorie needs. But lately I am eating 3 meals a day and wanting something like a midnight snack. Has anyone else felt this or gone through this? Can anyone give me some advice on controlling my eating? I can feel myself falling,Depression

Give me advice? I know what I should do thanks but talking is easy. And to be fair I do not want to do anything. I just want to stay here and feel miserable.

47845,I feel like I dont matter anymore These last few years my depression has only gotten worse no matter what I try. My fiance snaps at me when I try to make sure she isnt going to hurt herself my PTSD flares up every time something goes wrong. I dont feel like I can work anymore but I have to because I have to look after my fiance whos got BPD and bring in the money to afford food and rent. I dont feel like I can look after myself. Insomnia has been a bitch for me for years its only gotten worse in the last year. I like to maintain Im doing well but honestly I almost took some pills last night and locked myself in the bathroom. I dont want to be here anymore. But I dont feel like I can talk about it because my partner always has something for their own on when Im feeling low. I just bottle I guess. I want to talk I see a therapist but all the progress I make feels like it get reversed constantly. I havent felt this low in years and its hard to maintain a itll get better outlook like this. When? When will this get better?Ive been bullied at work punished for my disability at work Ive suffered through a narcissistic abusive mother and a father who just stood idly by. Ive had an ex SA me and cheat on me. Ive had friends lie and manipulate me taking advantage of me. I dont have a single family member I can trust anymore.The only thing keeping me going is my dog hes only 11 months. I love him so much. I never want to lose him. The desire to leave and go to work and never come back is so strong. Its so so overpowering that I feel like shaking. I dont want to feel like this. I dont want my PTSD to flare up every time something goes wrong I dont want my depression to spiral in turn I just want to be healthy again. I miss the competent me. My fiance has a lot going on I always understand that. I just sometimes dont feel like the same empathy I give her for her conditions gets extended to meI feel like Im just here for her. Outside of that I just kinda float in existence. I always used to joke that my name means happy or lucky but I havent felt it once. Im very unlucky. Happiness is so difficult for me to get. Im tired. I will try to stay around. I always have done. Ive survived all my worst days so far right? That what I say. I just wanted to vent and someone understand me for once.,Depression

9417,I am one of those former gifted kids that was in all the advanced classes basically until I hit high school and got depressed. Then I was just passing regular classes with ok grades no problem. Parents are evangelical christians and think that therapy is either just for literal psychopaths or an excuse for me to get hooked on drugs. Fine whatever I can live without it. I hit college and things go ok for a couple of years. Then the pandemic hits and everything goes to hell. Its so easy with online classes to say Ill do it later especially when they are asynchronous. Ill do it later turns into Ill do two days worth of work tomorrow and then I can catch up on everything over the weekend. Except you never do. And then the anxiety hits and you feel awful for not doing work so its on your mind 247. But you do not actually have the motivation to go do the work and you end up burying yourself in some instant gratification trying to hide from the anxiety and get out of actually putting effort into anything. Except this just feeds the anxiety more which makes you delve into more instant gratification and the cycle repeats endlessly. This has been my life for the past year and a half. Its maddening and I honestly regret not killing myself when I was 16. At least then I would not have to deal with this. Even with only one class to focus on this summer the cycle is as vicious as ever with no end in sight besides failure. I just want to break the cycle but it does a real good job of keeping you sucked in. Depression Anxiety has destroyed my ability to function as a student,Depression

17222,My journey was not easy and it is not over yet. But I am better something I still cannot believe today. Anyways here are principles that I have come to realize and want to share to everyone in the hopes that these will get you out.1. Family is what you make it. Choose them not stick with them. But be civil still2. People around you are either one of these two people to nurturelove or objects to use. When I said objects to use I mean those people that drag you down or does not think of you as important. You should not let them affect you but make the most use of them.3. Just go with what life throws. Be stubborn. If you want something to happen just keep doing it. you will either die trying and sad or be happy when you finally get what you want. Either way you get something you want. Either healing or death.4. Make the most of your strengths. This includes faking pain tolerance emotional etc. These things are our demons but we can use these to our advantage. Remember there are two kinds of successful people. Those who made it by shining bright and those who made it quietly in the shadows. Positive and negative. I know this may be confusing as English is not my first language. This may also sound bitter. But hey this got me out. Take it with a grain of salt. What I learned throughout my journey to overcome depression,Depression
19961,Not sure its the right place for this post but I do not know where else to post this.I was usually really horny even in periods of depression and also when I was under treatment.But since the start of this week i feel no reason to even masturbate or watch porn it seems useless even though it made me feel satisfied afterwards.Important to mention i feel stuck in life and quite frankly am stuck in life with my job that i literally cannot quit tho i want to really badly i feel like an outcast.So much more going on but I do not know how to put it into words. Help I have lost my labido,Depression

15529,Will try to keep this as concise as possible.Parents split when I was young mother met someone else. By age 13 I had been booted out of the house came home to find all my clothes in bags outside.Was in hostels until 18 then I got a place. Depression and anxiety from age 17.Met someone at 21 had a child at 22. Was probably at my happiest here.We broke up after 3 years mainly due to my mental health.A month later my best friend killed himself.I think I have what is called survivors guilt even to this day particularly because he was trying to call me at 6am the day I worked out he did it.I am in my 30s now I have barely ever worked due to mental health I have not had a serious relationship since. I have spent the majority of this time sitting alone. I have tried dating to no avail.I never went to college to further my education.I am essentially a total f up.I do not know what to do with my life.I think about ending it daily.I have friends. I exercise. I eat fairly well.Family are non existant.

48162,Emotional detachment For the last three years Ive experienced emotional detachment. Its been so long that I forgot I have it. I have close to no emotional reactions to anything external. The only way I can make myself cry is if Im pretending to be sad. I dont feel anything and it makes me think Im crazy. I dont act numb because I fake my emotions. Even when Im alone. I used to feel more. But now when situations occur when emotions would most likely come out it doesnt even feel like its happening to me. I could chop off all my hair and I would have no reaction. My sister got engaged and I had to fake my reaction. Whenever I hear news its just like hearing words and thats all. It doesnt feel like Im emotionless per se it feels like Im not even processing the situation in the first place. Logically I know its happening but I dont feel aware at all. Why is this? Is this depression? Am I a sociopath? Id also like to bring up that I have been diagnosed with OCD. And I had a very emotionally abusive father at a very young age.,Depression

17057,My psychiatrist basically asked me What do you want me to prescribe you so I am in this alone she is not informed on any of the meds she has prescribed me. She gave me Olanzapine and did not mention Parkinsons or disfigurement and told me there is no scientific evidence magnesium helps with depression. Lol. Rant aside I want to get off this thing everywhere I look it says decrease marginally but she insisted on every other day. Do you have any experience with mirtazipine? Can I wean off Mirtazipine 7.5 by taking one every other day? Not getting help from psychiatrist need community support,Depression

26107,I absolutely despise people that say do not worry things will change it will all be goodBecause it is a lie if you keep with that mentality of things will change I just need to wait for that big change nothing will ever change your life will be the same shithole over and over again and that is insane if you want to do something if you wish for something do not wait for it fight for it do not let anything defeat you because at the end when you are an old man of fucking 80 90 years you will regret everything you will say why I did not do this why I did not learn that if you want something that is achievable fight for it and do not give up if you do your life it is fucked so you want to be a social monster fight for it it might be horrible at first but at the end you will achieve your goals life will not give you something easy if something can go wrong it will so even if your life looks like the worst shit of all things you can change it you just need to fight for it.

8400,Most of us were born out of wedlock. Growing up with a lack of basic needs that are not tended to and even those who were planned still end up having a shitty life! Outside of that we have society on our necks about being happy chasing dreams when in reality people are struggling to just live! Homelessness is high drug and alcohol addiction is high suicide rates are rapidly rising. I will never bring a being into this shithole we call life. Humans are self centered and delusional end of story!!!!! No wonder there are so many addicts in the world. No wonder suicide rates are skyrocketing. No wonder this world is full of chaos and misery.,Depression

Along with having no friends the whole time and my girlfriend who had planned our whole future together left me. So now I have noone Ive tried meds and therapy but nothing has helped my family is just a huge mess on every side and I just have given up. Ive lost faith in ever really being happy again. Even my hair has become ruined Ive had long hair a majority of my life and its how I like it but its now thinning and receding Im not even 22. I really dont know what to do,Depression
24826,You know when you start realizing your old bad habits like not eating not sleeping or oversleeping emotionally numb so much anger and you know it is getting bad again but you have no idea how to stop yourself so you just let it happen . At the same time you do not let it show as it disappoints and upsets people so at the end of the day you really are alone. Getting worse,Depression

8905,Its not easy wearing a mask all the time. Sometimes I carry it well other times I cannot even find the strength to put it on. Everything is fine as long as I wear it but the minute it starts to slip I am no fun to be around I cannot even open up about the way I truly feel because nobody really understands. I do not enjoy doing anything. Literally. I am just on autopilot in a constant state of numbness. Its like I am just a ball and chain for my wife to carry around. Of course she is tired of it who would not be. She does not understand the constant pain I am in. She does not understand that she is the only reason I am even keeping on going. Opening up to her just causes her pain because I know she just wants me to be happy with her. The thing is though I would not be anywhere as happy as I am now without her. she is my world. I just do not know what to do. I feel guilty for her having to be around me like this. I feel like I have to wear a mask all the time,Depression
9433,Some background info firstOur relationship has been going on for about 3 months now. Although that is not a long time we have already managed to build a really strong bond and our relationship has progressed pretty fast.I just recently graduated and am now looking forward to studying at an university.My boyfriend has everything going for him as well. He just recently got his own amazing apartment he has a well paid and stable job and a supportive family. I live within a short distance away from him with my mom.Everything was going really well at first and within the first month of us dating he told me about his struggle with severe depression and suicidal thoughts. In 2020 a lot went wrong and he was really close to ending his life. He names his mother as the only reason he did not do it he did not want her to go through the pain of losing her only child. He already went through therapy twice that year which did not help. Taking any kind of pills is not an option for him. When we met he was having a good phase but during the past few weeks things have been getting worse and worse. Some days are really good others really really bad. I have struggled with mental health issues myself so I can relate to the feelings he is having to some degree. But his depression is unlike anything I have ever witnessed.When he is having a bad day and I am with him we barely talk and there is a lot of tension. He tries not to let it out on me which works most of the time.But it still hurts me to see him in so much pain.To listen to the person you love talking about suicide is a feeling unlike any other. I feel like I am not able to do anything about it.We often talk about the things that are bothering him. he is just convinced that there is no meaning to life and everything is already going downhill for humanity because of climate change and neverending waves of corona.These are just a few of his reasonsI know I cannot fix his depression or really do anything about the issues that are bothering him but I still feel so useless and hopeless.I truly love him and want to be a supportive girlfriend. it is not an option for me to leave him even tho this whole thing is really testing my beliefs and draining my own mental health. I am incredibly scared of him making a wrong decision and I honestly think he is very close to that.Has anyone had similar experiences with loved ones that are struggling with depression?Is there any way I can help more effectively besides just being supportive listening being there for him...If anyone has read this far thank you and I hope that there are people that are able to give me some good adviceEnglish is not my first language so please excuse any mistakes or weird phrasing I W18 am scared of my boyfriend M20 committing sucide,Depression

38086,this is my first reddit post also my first time sharing this information with anyone but i can t really keep it in anymore man so bear with me hopefully there s a psychiatrist out there that will read this and hit me with some world altering advice because there is absolutely no way in hell i will ever tell anyone especially not a doctor or psychiatrist what you are about to read but i really just need to get this out there first and foremost no im not going to kill myself let s get that out of the way but i do think im depressed i wa telling myself it wa just a life slump for a long time then i wa telling myself it wa just sadness from the slump now i ve literally been sad and thinking negatively of myself almost every day for like a year and i got ta talk about it with someone even if someone is this phone screen i ve always had major self esteem and confidence issue not really sure what it stem from but i have always felt inferior to those around me which btw i can not believe people live life happy with their appearance that is a blessing that people take for granted anyways ive done some research and educated myself with the science behind depression and i believe that over the past few year a mix of rapid lifestyle change and stress related event ha caused me to have depression the part that confuses me is that while my life is on the more stressful and busy side of thing i don t feel like it s a bad life to live i have wonderful friend family i have a great scholarship to a good school i do fun thing and go to party and drink i feel like an average person put in my shoe would be happy and excel if they had any drive or passion at all which i do not probably why i fuck everything up all the time it is common for me to have suicidal thought i really don t know why since in reality i wouldn t want to kill myself i may be a piece of shit but im not selfish nor do i like the pain of self harm i am self aware of these thought and i have attempted breathing and thought altering method to get rid of them but they pierce my heart and mind like a dagger it physically hurt they are not always about suicide but they are always very negative targeted at myself i just can t help staring out at the edge of that cliff wishing i had the nut to finally end it all sometimes i can t look at myself in the mirror because i know it ll lead me to thinking negatively about myself just at the sight of me and a sad a it is to say it i really just do not like myself i look in the mirror and want to smash it or rip my face off because of how ugly i am objectively and on paper i am not the worst looking guy im and im physically fit but holy shit i swear what i see in the mirror and what other people see when they look at me must be completely different there have been a few instance in recent month of people tell me im decent looking or im good looking or i have a nice body and i take the compliment and try and try to see it in myself but i just can t i literally can t i don t see it i don t know where you guy are looking but i truly don t see what you see okay it s not just about my appearance i find myself annoying and awkward i try to be a happy go lucky guy most of the time usually bringing conversation and a smile and sarcasm and even some humor sometimes but behind my smile is most commonly a frown im fucking annoying my thought scream at me at how what i just said is so stupid and i need to shut the fuck up why do i talk so much why would i ask that ect i talk too much sometimes i say thing i dont even mean or agree with just to say something i never know when to talk and when not to and it frustrates me a lot im volatile and irritable and ugh i fuck up most thing i do work school relationship you know how it go the classic poor me self pity i ruin everything type shpeal something about the way i wa made is just wrong i guess that s another one of those negative thought that repeat in my head a lot born wrong today i had the pleasure of envisioning myself fist fighting myself beating my own face in felt great honestly wish i could ve made it a reality i can t find happiness in any of the thing i used to enjoy ive gradually stopped all my hobby except for the gym which is where i take my anger out usually i have a lot of that i can t even sit through a movie without thinking what is the point of me doing this what is the point life feel numb pointless i go about my societal life just like everybody else i study work play sleep rarely but it all feel the same a gray bland mesh of nothing even something like eating delicious food i just don t get enjoyment anymore the best way i can explain how i feel is if im with people and someone make a joke that people laugh at of course i laugh but if nobody else laughed i would never know when to laugh honest opinion of myself i fucking suck im lazy and i lie all the time to keep up a persona of not being a sad downer hater fuck i constantly make poor decision and can t seem to learn from previous one im ugly the only thing im good at are mansplaining and making a fool of myself i say dumb shit and get shit on for it what kind of asshole ha the privilege and opportunity that i have and is still sad and lazy like this im the type of person that wa actually just wired wrong in the head and the fact that i try and try to be appreciative of my life and still can t disgust me to be honest i don t even know who i am a few month ago someone asked me what my hidden talent is i replied nothing i don t have one i really don t have a talent or something im good at and seeing people around me do amazing thing and then watching myself dig deeper and deeper into this rut really hurt i do not feel like this id say about 0 of the time i forget about all my stress and worry and appearance and fuck ups and im actually happy then when the happy go away i realize that whatever made me happy is so very temporary and it all come flooding back im just running around my mess of a life chasing those euphoric mindless high and happiness that seem to get weaker and shorter each time i find them the question i find myself asking often is why why am i doing this why do i feel this way why did i say that why did i do that why am i a certain way yadda yadda i am a realist i also truly believe there is no point to this life why do we all live such stressful unrewarding life putting all our effort in just to die and be forgotten forever i read comment on post like these saying that life is beautiful meet everyone you can experience nature get help it get better it can get better but the thing is no it can t everyone s situation is different i guess but where im at and what im doing nothing gon na change im not going anywhere even if i wa it wouldn t matter societal standing and fancy job position mean nothing human are not made equal everyone is different special in their own way therefore some people are biologically and factually better than others whether it s stronger larger smarter faster people are different and some trait are preferable i just happened to get stuck with the trait that make me fucking suck at life no amount of meditation or antidepressant fuck big pharm is going to change who i am people don t change painting a leopard red doesn t remove his spot it just hide them temporarily well it s and im going to the gym at and then lecture after that so i guess i should sleep a few hour so my motor function stay working so i can keep going on in this endless cycle of pointless effort thanks for hearing my ted talk wish me luck on my chemistry exam good night all lt,Depression
9441,Honestly I thought I had my shit together. I was diagnosed in 2018 so I decided to take a break from uni. Got a whole lot better like I stopped having panic attacks no longer hated to see my reflection in the mirror no longer sleep excessively. It was a good year of rest and then I decided it was time for to continue uni and I needed to do an internship because it was one of the graduation requirements. Never would I thought that this internship was going to be the reason I relapsed. Basically it was the only position that was available for me the other places rejected me. I am only required to do a 3 months internship but they requested it to be 5 months and I accepted because beggars cannot be choosers. Little did I know that this place was a shithole. Communication was 100 online yet they will not let join any group chat regarding any project whatsoever because I am an outsider and temporary yet they also throw their responsibilities to me without warning I am not given any mentoring whatsoever. I am a graphic design student and I feel like i have lost all sense of good design because my department head keeps requesting outdated design and honestly they do not make sense. I have been pestered by a coworker about the project that she dumped on me without warning. I have been humiliated in weekly meetings. I am losing sleep and losing my patience and most of all I lost my self esteem.I only have like 5 days left till my internship is over but every waking hour is like hell. I cry in the shower before I sleep and before I start work. Lately I can barely get up from my bed make so little progress for work and now I panic whenever I hear my phone notifications go off because I am afraid of what my coworkers would say bout my work. Plus I also only get paid 110 of our minimum wage and i use that money to pay for my internet plan so I can work online so its basically unpaid internship. If any of you are beaten down so bad by your surroundings to the point of depression I understand. I have supportive friends and I can barely go through this shit. If I faced this alone I am pretty sure I would have disappeared to a neighbouring town and change my identity and made sure no one will ever hear from me again. I swear I am this close to giving up Depression relapse,Depression
8263,This is my first time posting here or anywhere actually but I just really wanted to share this with someone. I have lost all my interest in things I used to enjoy the most. I think it happened three or four years ago but I could not accept the fact that I do not enjoy the thing I used to love the most it was animated movies so I kept forcing myself to watch them but every time I kept having weird thoughts and just would give up watching them thinking that Ill start enjoying later. To be honest the fact that I lost all my interest made me even more depressed. Now I do not enjoy anything. Listening to music does not bring joy anymore I skip meals and I do not feel excited for food as I used to before. I used to like cooking but now frying an egg seems like an impossible task to do. I started getting panic attacks last fall and struggled with thanatophobia for couple years and now I just have no energy to do anything. I feel anxious all the time. Sometimes I try watching some tv show but for some reason I just cannot watch it even if I want to. I cannot sleep at nights and only fall asleep when its 79am. I feel bad for my family because I feel like I am a waste of space and just useless but at the same time I cannot bring myself to do anything. I wish I never existed I feel like a total disappointment. Before I wanted to get therapy but after going to four different therapists I lost all the hope and now I do not want to cure my depression. For some reason my depression makes me feel safe now. I am really confused on what is happening with me. I am sorry for such a long post Losing interest,Depression

47701,Is this really my life? Being alive feels like a punishment and being ugly just makes it worse. I feel like I've committed a grave sin just for looking the way I do. I feel like such a fuck up right now. My social anxiety just keeps getting worst and it's even worse when I go out in public and I keep thinking about all the mistakes that I've made and how I'm seen as less than everybody. I hate my fucking self rn. I hate my fucking face and my life and just every fucking thing about me. I hate that I'm mentally unstable and... I'm so tired. I really don't want to die but I don't want to really be here. I wish I could restart my life and make better choices. Maybe things would be better for me rn.

13414,At the age of 23 I am a 57 male. My dad is taller than me and my younger brothers are taller than me at 510 and 59. Everywhere I look on the internet or even just regular conversations people seem to be OBSESSED with height. Any short male is deemed as a joke these days and I cannot take it anymore.I do not even like standing up because I am reminded of my height. I do not look in a mirror because of how ugly and short I am. A reminder that men will always look down on me thinking they can beat me up and if I were to magically get a girlfriend her friends and family will always remark on how she could do better.I do not see the point in continuing on. The only way a short guy like me can find some sort of happiness in this world is by being very rich. Otherwise no matter how hard I work no matter how social I am Ill always be 57. Ill always be a joke and a last option for women.Once I move out I plan on dying. I cannot live in this height obsessed society anymore. Too ashamed to stand up or look in a mirror.,Depression
19767,Yesterday I started a one week Medical Camp at my high school as I want to become a Neurosurgeon. I am an incoming senior and bonded with this incoming freshmen on the first day we are lunch and had very similar interests. The next day this other girl starts to become her new best friend while knowing I am her friend. But honestly its the freshmans fault for ditching me. I have been very popular throughout schooling and this has never happened before. I felt really down when the freshman and the other girl just walked past me at lunch without even inviting me or asking where I was going. What should I do? And then my mom is going to call me a pathetic loser for telling the freshman girl about my worst enemy who she dances with? I do not even want to go to this camp anymore! Totally I got totally ditched at lunch for Medical Camp by my new friend...,Depression
11885,Quit from my full time shift job due to decreasing performance.Moved out of my rented room to my parents home due to unable to afford paying rent.In debt.Constantly sleeping because I do not want to wake up and live.do not even have the motivation to do housework. cannot ask sibling to help because she is sick after spinal surgery.Constantly in shouting fights with parents and siblings to the point that I feel like taking a knife either to kill them or kill myself.Broke up with exfiance because I was constantly irritated. Slammed the door and shouts at my mom in response to her nagging. Feeling hateful and desires to kill my sick sister because I am tired of taking care of her.Tried therapy but I skipped the appointments too many times just because I do not want to get out of bed. I was born in a religious community but I do not have faith. Sometimes I wish I just hang myself or jump off from a tall building or even just expose myself to COVID and die. This is no offense to those who actually died from it. Watching the news of their death I always thought it should have been me instead of them. Just like when my late father died it should have been me instead of them.At the very least as useless as I am alive I am more useful dead. If I die but not due to suicide through my life insurance my burial costs are covered my family will get some money that can feed them a month or two Been living with this depression for almost a decade.I just do not have the energy motivation nor perspective to live. Wissh that I can just die in my sleep.But in the end all I can do is just write this cry myself to sleep and curse myself if I wake up again tomorrow. I wish I will get COVID and die,Depression

18810,is not it funny how the dumbest menial shit can send you back into a depressive episode you thought was over? Every day feels the same. The exact same. I am constantly fucking everything up and I just want to stay in bed all day. I am being spread too thin. No one listens. No one cares.I am not taking good care of myself either. I wonder if subliminally I am trying to die. I eat garbage and drink garbage and think garbage and breathe garbage. I do not enjoy doing the things I normally love. Everything is an inconvenience. I am married and have children. I do not feel important to my family. I feel I let them down constantly because I do not have the energy to give them what they want. To be what they need me to be. The tasks around the house pile up and up. I just want to rest. I just want to feel like this all means something instead of lying in bed at night and feeling the terror that someday I will be dead and I will wasted my life being a miserable asshole. A dead end job a slob and fucked up all the time,Depression
12326,I hope it is okay to post this here. I have someone I know through online channels only who is going though a really hard time. Their parent is terminally ill they are the primary caregiver and they are suffering from depression.They have stopped returning messages and have been avoidant and clearly are very overwhelmed. We had an emotional and romantic interest in each other. I know up until he stopped replying he was still making those feelings known. He has told me several times when he is gone quiet that he is overwhelmed and dealing with a lot. he is always wanted me to know he still cares when does pop up and he is always maintained he still has those feelings for me. I know he is just so focussed on everything else going on which I completely understand.Now that he is retreating even longer than usual over a week and has not replied to my messages of concern I do not know if I should just leave him alone or continue to send him supportive messages. I do not want to be annoying but I also want him to know I care and I am thinking of him without any pressure to reply... But also do not want to pressure him in a romantic way in case he does not feel that way anymore.I would love to understand what people here would want in the same situation. I just want him to know I care and he is not alone. I do not expect anything else. Someone I care about is going through a really dark period. How can I help them?,Depression

27016,I do not want to exist anymore I cannot describe it I do not want to kill myself but I do not want to live my life anymore. I am just sick of being a disappointment to myself and my family who seems to have it all together. I have not done jackshit in the past 5 years the only thing I have to show for it is my high average grades which are not even impressive. Everyone in my life has their life together I have not experienced the same things that nearly almost everyone else has. Making and enjoying time with friends? No not even one. Finding love and sharing your first kiss? I have not even hugged a girl besides my momfamily. Hell I cannot even talk to someone without it going into a multihour long silence. Everyday I just look at my screen wondering if it will get better for me but it almost never does. I never listen. I am always in my head. I am selfish and I feel like a part of me deserves it. I am an idiot intellectually and socially. I wish I was born different. I do not want to exist but I do not want to kill myself,Depression
11052,So let me take you back to 1989. I had made a pretty bad decision in joining the USAF as I ended up as an SP Security Police pretty much a patrolman did not realize my ADHD was still there and only controlled by a lot of caffeine and depression had been lurking in the background. I was stationed in the UK and was pretty much miserable. My Sergeant was a fullon asshole as were his two subordinates. Things came to a head one night while I was guarding an ammo depot. I am sitting in the shack trying to read through a manual to help me be a better cop as it was and that darkness hit me hard. As a Law Enforcement person I was issued a service revolver. Before I realized it I had it in my hand and was putting the barrel in my mouth. I could not feel anything but emptiness and no reason to keep living. Cocking the hammer back I sat there and mentally asked for a reason ANY reason to not pull the trigger. At that moment the faces of my family and friends flashed in my head. I realized that killing myself was not going to end my pain it would create pain to those I cared about. I took the sidearm from my mouth eased the hammer back and just broke down crying. I told my C.O. what happened and was taken off duty and sent for therapy. Not long after I was discharged Honorable and went home. It took me 32 years to finally open up and talk about that night because I was so bothered that I had come so close to ending my life early. Sure life has had its up and downs but I am glad that I chose to live. It has given me an overdeveloped sense of selfpreservation. Yes I am still dealing with depression and seeing a therapist. There are days when it just feels like everything is shit but I just push through. ampx200BMODS I am hoping that this is within the rules. I just needed to get this posted to keep being able to talk about that moment. Please let me know if this is the wrong subreddit and if there is one that would be more appropriate. Thank you. It took 32 years for me to open up about this...,Depression

21573,I am currently 33 single on a train towards my mother. I do not have brothers or sisters. Mother is all I have got left.3 months ago I was abroad living with my married partner still married as of 110721 been with her 10 years and my family. Nice place fantastic job I still have but energy for this dropped to zero dogs pets the whole picture. We had an amazing buffer and had an even greater outlook on the future. We barely fought perhaps if it had to be steak or chicken for dinner.Now 3 months later my wife is about to be diagnosed with potentially various mental disorders. Something in her head clicked 3 months ago slept around started to drink smoke had various physical yes it started with physical ailments tachycardia ovary pain it all pointed towards potential bipolar and perhaps something else. She overdosed entered into a psychiatric facility who said the same she is bipolar. I look behind her eyes and there is nothing left of the woman I once met.I went to the doctor I need help. And he did extra pills therapy.In the ten good years I have had with her we fulfilled the bucket list financially secure loving family. We did everything together. All countries we tried all drugs we bought our first car etc. All shared firsts. The financiall security has diminished as she went into hardcore drugs to mask the mayhem in her brain she is now on prescribed pills by her shrink but subsequently were the ones she used for overdose.She feels the entire world is after her to get her. Her entire group of friends altered all her previous friends are enemies the new ones are nothing but codependent enablers who yammer nothing wrong with you girlAn extremely bright person broke into a 1000 pieces.I could not focus anymore work went tits up.I have already achieved everything I wanted and all I wanted now was to keep what we had. Life is not a rodeo i remember I buried my dad so I was expecting a downturn but not one like this.I wrote various this is it suicide letters to all my friends and loved ones for their help over the years and went to a bridge last thursday night. A jump would have done it not on a car. Minimum impact. i had a list left of people Id call if I would do something this big.one picked up we talked for 6 hours following morning doctor higher dosage.They all understood. Even my mum. All understood they were respectful. I am walking around with 150 pressure in my head while I can only take 100 daily. I told my friends and my doctor and therapist. My head is ticking. I can take this another few weeks until I break again. They got it.I am in perfect condition eat healthy.The overdose the mourning of what I once had the now what question as I already achieved financial and corporate success in my field and all hobbies I once had are triggers to my past. So obviously I am trying new hobbies I use the pills I meet friends I work out I still do my job at 25 I keep swimming.But this is nothing more but a boring equation of I realize time heals wounds but if time is 45 days and I am currently drowning every day I do not know if I will make it to those 45 days...Any advice? Because this write up was nothing else to waste another 15min to get to that time heals wounds phase. What to do now? I feel I have done everything I achieved in life family work and it came crashing down after I hit the summit,Depression
22644,I recently got diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder my anxiety is a bitch and I do not know if I feel comfortable in my relationship anymore. I have been trying everything and on medications but I want to have a more natural approach. Also the medications side effect has given me tinnitus so pretty much every day I do not feel a reason to exist. I am not helping anyone. I have been in college forever because I keep changing my mind about what I want to do. This makes me feel like the biggest failure. I am turning 26 in September and I hate who I am. I would like to know if anyone has tried any natural supplements that work for them? I am running out of options and I really need this to get better. I have had depression for my entire life.,Depression

21685,My step brother contestantly kicks me In the face and slaps me but when I barely poke him with a flashlight to retaliate he calls me a bitch baby even though he is acting like a 3 yr old. It makes me depressed that no one agrees he needs with me about him needing to grow a pair and be made a man but I am called a bitch when I barely mess with him which usually results in me getting physically harmed by him what do I do. Tldr getting harassed and physically hurt by stepbrother and what do I do? Btw he tells me occasionally how I am ugly and no one loves me which does not help me mentally I am pissed,Depression

12834,He said he was falling to a black hole and he would not want to meet me and needed to be alone. it is been 4 months since. I kept texting him and he responded at first. I got worried when he said that he has not seen or talked to any friends. I know his sleeping and eating patterns were crappy even before. His family or other friends does not know about the depression. He said he has seeked help but I have not heard how is it going. He said that my messaged did not bother and he did not block me or anything even when I said he could if it gets overwhelming. it is been 2 months since he responded any of my messages. Should I give him space or keep texting some stupid memes etc.? I guess the history of us dating for a while makes me anxious that he would just want to cut all contact with me if his dating someone else for example. Shoul I keep checking on a depressed guy who has isolated and has not responded to my texts for months?,Depression
23718,I finally washed my hair after almost 10 months. The thing that helped was on one day I sat down and untangled my matted hair with my hand as much as I could instead of reaching for the comb directly. It took me an hour. Listening to a podcast helped. The next day I used a comb. I think I did this about twice in those 10 months. it is not some great achievement. But I wanted to record this to remind myself of the hell I have gone through. My brain is such that as I am slowly coming out of the fog I berating mysef for the lost time forgetting that I was heavily depressed. Please be kind towards yourself everyone who is suffering here. tip for tangled hair,Depression
9877,Everyone I love is gone stuck in a bullshit job. Nothing that I really want to do with my life. I have always been a giver and love to take care of others but there is no one left to need me. Bills and life are so expensive and once I pay them I just have to pay them all over again. I can buy a handgun or a shotgun and just have it all be over but I cannot decide. What do you do when you have nothing to live for?,Depression
18292,For the past few days I feel like I have been so selfdestructive that my negative energy is simply so big and it feels like I am destroying other people as well...I do not know what to do I do not feel like doing anything...I think it is best for me to hide in my corner so nobody else gets hurt by my negativity... I am the villain in my own story,Depression
11561,I no longer know what else to do but write this. I am not even sure what I expect to come of it except for hopefully support and sympathy and trying to see light at the end of this dark tunnel. I will preface this quickly with the fact that I am generally a very happy person but I feel so defeated I do not know where else to turn. I have been with one woman the past 9 years of my life and I am only 26. We have an immense story together over all that time but I think like any person in my position I thought we were going to last forever. We even share a kiddo together.When I learned she was pregnant I really started to get my life together. We got married too around this time. I was working whatever jobs I possibly could and I was always taking the next step forward to provide for my family. After about 2 years and wanting more out of life I overextended into a career I was not ready for. I made a few mistakes in their eyes and they politely asked me to leave. I was really devastated by this because it was a career I had put a lot of time and research into only for it to fall flat. Nevertheless I pushed forward and with constant strain from my wife's side of the family I decided to move my family to my home state with the help of my side of the family. Things were no fairy tale however. Our living situation was very bad especially with a kiddo. Again I started working and only thanks to my best friend willing to let us stay in his home were we able to salvage the situation. For the first time in our relationship and marriage my wife got a job with me while my mom watched our kiddo. We worked very hard together and I cherish those memories a lot. I think due to all of the stress we both decided to start smoking weed. I think she was 24 and I was 22 at the time. We were a very straight edge couple before then. Anyway after about 3 months we were back on our feet but once we had our own place again and bills to pay the financial strain started to hit again even with us both working. Mostly because of the long drive to get work and very little hours. I asked our boss for a raise and she said no despite us working there for 6 months and always going above and beyond what was asked of us while others slacked slept on the job and had us covering their messes. We quit promptly and afraid of losing our situation again I uttered the words If I have to work fast food I will. Well I ate those words quickly. With no other job prospects in sight I literally had to work at a fast food restaurant up the street despite all my prior work experience. I hated it at first. My wife and I played a lot of video games together and in an attempt to better ourselves we started livestreaming. We had mild success together but it was not enough to pay the bills. The thought of coming home to livestream after my horrid job was the only thing pushing me through. Once again with this job I would actually run the entire restaurant with maybe just one other person while the managers would sit in the back. I did dishes cleaned disgusting grease traps over and over cooked all the food at the highest quality and trained new members because people would quit left and right. I did this for about 6 months praying that our livestreaming would pay any sort of dividend. Despite the immense effort we had put into building a quality livestream and building a community we just could not get it off the ground. I started heavily abusing marijuana because I felt so lost and it made me feel good even when things were not good. I think with being the age I was and the drug use I started to experience a severe break in my mental health. Therapy resolved the issues almost entirely but I did do pretty severe damage to my family as a whole while they carried me through that low point. No meds no more weed and I was back on track. Just to add a little more to that last section of the story too I was really banking on being a popular enough streamer to get by in life. There was not anything else I wanted to do. However smoking weed did open my mind to the thought of making music. When our streams would end unsuccessfully I would get high and stay awake another 4 hours or so into the night and write music even though I had never done such a thing my entire life. The music was pretty bad but it was entertaining enough to keep me distracted while I tried to escape my struggles. I tried to become a manager at the restaurant but somebody else always got promoted before me. Even people working there for 2 weeks were on the path to becoming a manager before I was. I did mention a lot that I was more interested in livestreaming or music panning out for me than I was working as a manager but the thing was that I was literally doing the entire job anyway in hindsight. When I made an actual shot at it I was told no. We had the worst skeleton crew you could ever imagine. Frustrated I quit the restaurant I quit livestreaming I quit gaming and actually caught a break getting a new sales job with an unlimited earning potential. I was still writing music as sort of a gag to show my friends and express my creativity. The sales job was a major blessing but I sucked very bad at it. Every single person told me they were not interested in the product I was supposed to be selling. My sales manager actually commented about never seeing someone quite as bad as me at sales. It hurt me a lot but I figured it just was not for me despite how much I loved the thrill of talking to people so directly and trying to get them excited about a product. I tried 2 sales jobs and eventually found a chill job doing security work. I never forgot what I learned from my sales jobs. With all the time to think about my future at my new job I finally decided to give my music career a real go. I would actually produce music on an old laptop in my car at the worksite. I had worked in almost every industry besides automotive and medical so I really did not know what else to try. This is where it all gets very interesting. My security job was reasonably getting my family by while I did this whole music thing. With the combination of all the things I had learned in the past music was actually my greatest tool in the end. It helped me sell myself as a person to get the things I wanted. My music never spread the way I saw some others did. Millions of plays thousands of plays hell I was lucky to even get 20 plays. It did not matter. I could show people my songs socialize and get everything I really wanted which was to be heard. I cannot express how much life was getting exponentially better day by day. I was so confident that my music was just one good ear away from either going viral or helping me to my next big opportunity. Naturally with my charisma growing my marriage getting stronger and really selling myself as a true rockstar I was ready to take things to the next level. My wife had discovered her bisexuality over the course of this time since starting to smoke weed. We talked about having experiences with other women but as I am sure any person knows it is difficult to swing getting lucky with one person let alone two at the same time. I saw it as a good challenge but never expected it to work. After a solid year at my security job I had produced so much music. I loved every single song so much and still I was not able to really turn a profit on anything. I did have one song reach 100000 plays but it hardly translated into any traction as far as followers or return listeners. To reiterate I was more focused on how I could use music as a tool to gain the interest of another woman in my life rather than money. I met many different women had wonderful experiences but my wife and I really wanted to be with someone the way we were with each other. Long term committed etc. Before long we actually had attracted someone. We talked for about a month and made things official. We were all dating as a triad. If you could not guess as a man living like this was heaven on Earth. I even found a job in this automotive parts factory making great money while I worked on my next huge musical project. Unfortunately dating like this with all the new emotions really tore me up at times. I experienced a lot of jealousy while I provided on the job side of things while my girlfriend and wife stayed at home. My mental health broke down again for the first time in years and out of paranoia I broke up with my girlfriend. She was pissed at me and did not take being broken up with lightly. I regretted my decision within days and begged her to come back. She declined over and over. My wife and her kept seeing each other while I worked and I mostly found it fair just because of the mistakes I had made. I was determined to show my girlfriend that I still loved her and make amends. I leveraged my factory work into an even better factory job making more money and with one of the most solid companies nationwide. I drastically improved myself as a person and I even found a confidence being alone like never before. My wife actually missed the 3 of us being together just as much as I did and then she convinced my exgirlfriend to give me another chance. To celebrate I took them on a vacation to a beautiful beach condominium. We all grew closer and I even decided to try smoking weed again with my ladies after being sober for like 2 years. I had never been so high in my entire life I was literally shaking and could barely even use the microwave to make myself food. It felt like the most earned vacation of a lifetime even in my own head. I had an extremely pleasant thought that was something like Wow I am really just a normal guy with nobody coming after me to hurt me being like this. I can just live my life and enjoy this heaven forever. Our relationships peaked so hard here. I was actually in heaven with only a little paranoia of my nontraditional dating habits coming back to bite me in some way. Great money 2 beautiful women my credit was building to buy a house and a new album ready to be dropped on the horizons. With my relationships settled the only thing I was really suffering in was the typical 95 work in a factory which had nothing to do with the career I actually wanted music. With a sizable savings to give my music all the promotion hard work and love it really needed I quit my factory job. I told my ladies and they were very apprehensive. This is where things take a drastic turn for the worst. Little did I know my chicks were still actually having some issues regarding the whole relationship. It came in a way I could have least expected. My wife the person I had been through thick and thin with for 9 years came out as being fully gay. It makes my stomach turn to even think about how they sat me on the bed to tell me that. I thought I had done something wrong to mess things up or they were mad about the job but no. It was something entirely out of my control. My girlfriend looked at me with sorrow because she knew it meant it was over for us too even though we had just fixed things. I wrote the song Mistakes Are Lessons as the final flex that despite not making a mainstream appearance I was living the life that every dude on Earth could have dreamed of. The beat came first but I did not finish the 2nd half of the lyrics until I had been broken up with which is why they are kind of somber sounding. I am now going through a divorce I am unemployed and despite searching for a job I cannot find one. Even if I could I am almost completely spent as a person. I had a short run going back to school thinking I wanted to be a doctor but after studying biology it really just hammered into me more that I need to pursue my passion of music. The only energy I have left to give this world is my music and my story. I am scared writing this because at the moment I have 24 in my bank account. I have never reached such a rock bottom in my life. The hardest most depressing thought of my life is returning to the typical work grind where I have to hide my real personality. People always made me feel like I had to live and experience things to create great music so that is what I went and did. I know there is still more experiences to be had but I feel like I have learned lessons no man my age should know. I have gone from living in heaven to feeling like a slug. I do not know what else to do. Believe it or not there is so many details I left out of this story I would love to tell but it is already long enough as is. On a happy note I ended up in a long distance relationship with an amazing friend that I actually had been telling my life story to for months on end. She did not care about my past and she was actually the first person to ever describe my music as beautiful. I really do try and make it that way sometimes and she saw that. I have never loved someone as much as her. All I want out of life at this point is to tell my stories listen to music create music perform music and still be financially sound. that is really the whole baseline of this story too. I have been chasing financial freedom for years trying different things only to be taken advantage of time and time again. I just do not know if I can do it anymore. Being in this situation makes me feel like a failure as a Dad a failure as a musician and a failure as a person. Will I ever be enough? Financial Freedom,Depression
10076,I am not afraid that I have not prepared well or I will fail. I am not even thinking about anything related to studies education future or even myself. I do not know what is happening with me I have no clue why the hell I am even sad. I am feeling very discomforted. I have not faced any trauma but still I am in pain. Maybe I am depressed but how the hell someone can be depressed without any reason.I just do not know what to do where to go. I am feeling like I do not belong to this world. Those people I was very attached to are now feeling like strangers. The stuff I used to do in childhood now seems boring. I do not feel any reason to be in this world without any hope without any urge to live. I am just miserable. I wish I could be strong enough so I could end this depressing life. I got exam at 9 am and I am crying rn 2am,Depression
9740,The Earth is fucked. Climate change is just going to get worse and at this point I cannot do anything about it. The corporations and billionaires are just going to keep exploiting and raping the world of all of its treasures and natural beauties. I do not want to live in a world that is on its death bed. what is the point of going to college right now when I am not going to get a good job anyways. I may as well drop out and get a shit job because that is what Ill end up with no matter what. would not it be better if I just killed myself and rid the world of one less wasteful person? Population is an issue anyways. I do not want to work my entire life never being able to retire. I fucking hate that I am addicted to my phone because its one of the only things I can occupy myself with without cutting myself to shreds. I became an adult last year and all I wish I could do is either die or go back to the ignorance and bliss of childhood. I want to be a happy idiot instead of a sad one. All that would make me happy is for me to live in the woods away from all people until I starve. I used to want to study film in school and now that I am all I want to do is quit. There is no money in making films when you have no talent or skill. I made the deans list after torturing myself this year as a freshman and instead of feeling any accomplishment I just feel like I have to make it again this year or Ill just quit school all together. It does not even mean much because I am a fucking film student. I am wasting my time with a major that is a scam. The only issue is that there is nothing else in the world that I would study. I am stuck. I am not talented and I do not even know if I enjoy film so now I am just going to be stuck with a major that will not give me and chance of success in life.I am so done with this bullshit world but Id be lying if I were to say that I was going to kill myself. I do not even have the balls for that. I think about it every day but I am not brave enough to do it. I may even join the military and hope that I can die. Everything is fucked,Depression

17533,I have been on anti depressants for the anxiety benefits because I have constant heart palpitations when I was not on them apperantly from anxiety.I am on metfromin for my diabetes and I am in trulicity an injection. I found out without insurance the injections are 900 dollars for a 4 week supply. I pay 27 dollars.I finally can afford therapy too. I have been seeing a therapist for a few months now.But every day I have to work my job the attacks are coming back no matter what I change my depression meds to or higher dosages. I have been thinking of suicide so much I have started fantasizing and plotting it.I have started making plans of getting rid of my cats and my things. So it is all taken care of ect ect.But... I do not have to die. I could quit. I could find another job. One that... does not give me amazing benifits... and I cannot have all of the medical help I have now...But what if I found one that did not make me want to die?I have been holding on because I think the medications might be the only thing stopping me from ending it. Without them I worry I cannot do it. I... am wondering how hard my life would be if I quit my job.,Depression

48268,How to explain the cause of my depression to a therapist? I have been depressed for 34 years because I am unattractive to women. It's not their fault that they don't find me attractive the problem is me because I am not cool enough for them.I get very anxious when talking to girls because I always feel that something bad is gonna happen. That repells them and even if they found me attractive they end up telling me that they are not interested.How do I explain this to a therapist and how is heshe gonna help me? I feel like this problem is impossible to fix because you can't make a person me attractive.,Depression
9438,I found out I had depression a few weeks ago and since that I have been vomiting everyday and have no appetite.

19176,I have had 5 jobs in the past year and only one has been longer than a monthmy first job which I went back to after leaving as a safety cushion with one lasting 2 and a half days.The most recent is my current job and I am worried I will hit the wall I did with the last few. The point where my brain decides that making my life better is not worth the work. It does not help that I have no idea what I want out of life so working hard feels pointless most of the time.I do want to have a good life but I do not know what that means. I do not know what to do with my free time because nothing seems very interesting and I lose attention after a bit of doing it anyway. I am not sure why most people stay alive because it does not seem worth it to me. All the good parts of life do not seem to make up for the bad parts. it is so hard to stay at a job because I do not want to be there and I do not have reason to need it. Why would I go be miserable for a quarter of my life at work just so I can be bored and unhappy for the rest of my life? Keeping a job,Depression

18300,I mean I have literally considered myself borderline asexual for the past few years. I have not had any desire for romantic relationships I masturbate like twice and year and rarely ever get horny either. In fact I find it and gross and annoying when other ppl are horny or talk about sex. I literally do not resonate with anyone anymore. It makes me sad tho I feel like I am losing all my humanity and I deserve to feel pleasure lol Has anyone just lost their sex drive due to depression?,Depression

12951,I started in the morning but now I take it from about 1011 pm. My mom said this was I do not digest the pill before the day is over and get depressed or something along those lines. I usually stay up until about 1 keeping my mind busy so I am not laying there depressed until about the same time. I was prescribed trazedone to be used as needed but it makes me very moody and weepy so I do not use it. I know going to bed earlier would be ideal but that does not often happen for me plus I am 17 so even though its not good to do what are the odds of me actually going to bed on time?. I want to talk to my mom about taking them at a different time and taking them myself. All meds are locked up currently. I was home alone for 2 weeks and skipped them for like 5 days cuz sometimes i get depressed so its hard to get the motivation to get up to take them. I kept them by my bed which fixed that but did not tell my mom because I do not want her to worry about me stashing them or anything. Idk sorry this is kind of all over the place.. I take Prozac at bedtime could this be making me depressed at night?,Depression
38485,i love my family i have a slightly distant yet mostly kind older brother a supporting and caring mother and a funny and relatable father i have a stable home life and have a roof over my head and i never starve i would say i have an amazing family and life yet i constantly ruin it i ve been sick and i ll probably need to repeat the grade even doing online course i don t know if i can even pas high school my parent have spent a lot of medical fund for a useless child i have no friend since covid started due to online course and the only people that i constantly to other than my family are doctor and my tutor i make sure that my family never find out i m suicidal though they don t need any more problem i don t even know if you would call me a suicidal a i only have suicidal thought daily i don t cut myself or do anything like that but the reason is because i want to see my family in japan one last time before i die we re going on a trip to japan this summer and that s the sole thing i m living for i m scared of the thought of what will happen to me once i no longer have anything to look forward to i know that at this point i ll probably kill myself the second we come back here at least i ll be known a the cousin who probably died first instead of the suicidal one or a drug addict i know how much my entire family pretend my cousin who is a drug addict doesn t exist so i know the horrid backlash that would occur if i survived i know that if i fail dying i ll fake a recovery before properly offing myself sorry this ended up turning into a suicide idolization rant if you managed to even read it this far i bet your thinking why don t i just get a therapist therapy solves everything not i had a therapist for a whole month and i hated the judging eye the subtle why are you here you have a great life and the fact that they treat you like some kind of test subject orochimaru like creepy people i honestly managed to connect more with my tutor that i ve only known for month who i only met once every two week on zoom never met her in person now i bet your thinking wait why did you contradict yourself you said that your family didn t know you are suicidal and yet you had a therapist it wa because i had to go to so many doctor so often that mother thought about my mental health and gave me a therapist i had the therapist or month before my mother decided that i wa just fine i thank my ability to hide suicidal thought well thank you reddit for letting me make this confession i felt like i needed to say it somewhere where no one would ever find out who i am,Depression
7116,I do not remember what a hug feels like anymore. Everyone I know would benefit from it and you would just be doing them a service. Please just do everyone in my life a favour and take out the trash. I cannot keep going anymore it hurts so much and I cannot even let myself cry about because I know I will break because I know the only people who will hear it are the people who will tell me to be quiet and stop bothering them. Please just kill me,Depression
14603,Hi everyone I am new to this subreddit. I am simply here to share something with all of you and to maybe gain a little bit of insight. My whole life I have felt like a burden. I have always been the outcast growing up. All the other kids would pick on me in school. I have always felt left out. I feel like I missed out on a lot of things in life because of it. I want to transition into manifestation. I feel like i simply manifest negative energy. I think negatively quite often and I feel like it affects me in a very bad way. Sometimes I find myself trying to think positively but at the end of the day I am just a negative person in general. Sometimes I feel like my own family does not like me even though they most likely do. I feel like there is more for me to say but as of right now I am not sure what to talk about anymore. Thank you for reading. Feeling Like a Burden,Depression

14260,I am in lockdown at the moment with a lot of people not giving a shit. we have been in lockdown for 5 weeks so far with no end date in sight. I am missing my parents and my friends so so much. I can feel myself spiralling further. I am still taking my meds and normally they work. I have been stable for a while now only experiencing mild episodes. Since maybe the third week of lockdown I started getting worse. I have relapsed into self harm for the first time in years. My suicidal thoughts are getting really difficult to ignore. I have not slept more than 3 hours a night for at least a fortnight now. It sounds stupid but I have started vaping to help with my urges. Knowing that its bad for me makes me keep doing it. I am going to try and quit once lockdown is over but I do not even know when that will be. It sounds really stupid but knowing the harm its causing me just helps. At least a little. My partner took away my artist scalpels because Id been using those. But then I found a lighter and just used that instead. I just struggle to care. I feel so empty. I am struggling,Depression
48111,need help with SSRI nausea I was wondering if anybody has had nausea with one SSRI but not with some other one?I am taking Zoloft and nausea is pretty bad even with the one half of 50 mg tablet. I dont know if switching SSRIs would be beneficial or this side effect would remain the same?What is interesting is that I have taken Zoloft 15 yeras ago with absolutely no issues at at all and now I feel like I am taking a poison. I don't understand this at all.Thanks!,Depression
47836,I feel utterly lost and purposeless Just like the title said I feel completely lost on what my objective is in life.

12102,It hurts being friends with someone who is basically everything you wish you were and has basically everything you wish you had. it is like life just decides to be cruel and dangle a dream in front of you knowing that no matter what you will never be able to obtain what they were so easily born into with just sheer luck. It just eats me up inside and makes me feel like somehow they are my worst enemy but they are my friend and I adore them still.it is hard being dependent on them in more ways than just emotionally because it feels like if something were to ever happen to them or they just did not like you anymore then a part of you just dies. Sometimes it feels like without them life is not worth living. They do not like my dependency on them understandable and I also know they will move on with their lives and find someone that they value more than me. I do not even want their love but I just wish that I had someone for myself who put me before others.I am just so tired of being mentally ill. It makes me wish that I did not feel anything at all because I do not even know what normal is. I was not raised to be normal I was raised to be a broken depressed anxious mess. Envy and Complicated Emotions,Depression

16246,My mom found a bunch of old pill packages from when I did pills. I have been off of them for almost a year and my mom is convinced they are new and I am going to overdose. I tried telling her that they were not from any time recent. She just says I am lying and now I am grounded from my friends. She goes through my drawers and searches my room. I am currently 17 and feel like I should be granted some form of privacy. She outright said she was going to continue going through my room and is convinced she is right and I am lying. I had a drug problem in the past so this kind of behavior would be normal 2 years ago but after almost 2 years of sobriety from hard drugs and the work I have put in to mend my relationship with my family I feel like my effort is being ignored and my mom continues to call me a liar tomy face. She always pushes her religion on me and will not allow me to be vaccinated due to her believing that vaccines are the mark of the beast. Yet I am the one who needs help. I am just so ready to leave this house. My parents will not Allow me to get an ID so I cannot even work to save up for an apartment. Literal tyrants run my life. My parents never believe me,Depression
16391,This is not antitherapy therapy can teach you a lot of important tools but it still has a lot of issuesWhenever I go to therapy the focus is on how many panic attacks I have been having how often I am selfharming rate your mood on a scale of 15 rate your ability to focus on a scale of 15. These are all just symptoms though and getting rid of them would not make me feel better in fact Id probably be more miserable with no outlets or coping mechanisms. I feel like the goal is to integrate you into society as quickly as possible without disrupting anyone rather than you know getting to the root of your issues. Therapys main goal is to make you highfunctioning,Depression

25969,I am 15 years old and I feel like shit. Even though its summer i feel like nothing fucking matters anymore. I recently took a trip to see family on this trip I saw my cousin who was in town for a volleyball tournament and my older brother who lives here. The trip was an absolute disaster I fucked up my friendship with my cousin cuz of something I do not even remember saying and the week alone I was supposed to have with my brother got ruined because I got everyone sick my dad is mad at me for a shit ton of reasons and i feel like an absolute piece of shit. I do not know what to do at this point. I do not have any friends I am basically all alone and I just feel like no one cares. I feel awful,Depression
11379,So I usually take Desvenlafaxine 100mg Clonazepam 1mg in the night. And Bupropion 150 XL and Clonazepam 0.25mg Propranolol 20mg in the morning.This morning I ended up taking Desvenlafaxine 100mg Clonazepam 1mg again in the morning along with Clonazepam 0.25mg Propranolol 20mg. I got super nervous when I realised the mistake and tried to voluntarily throw up to get the tablets out but no such luck. I have messaged by doctor regarding this but meanwhile if you has any insights as to what to expect and what can I do about it it would be great. Help! Double dosed on my antidepressant!,Depression
11002,The past couple years have changed me and really put things into perspective for me I am in the US. I have lost all motivation and reason for doing things I am always negative and pretty much constantly worry about death. I have gotten so fucked up mentally this past year. I have become extremely depressed I stopped working out to do any of my hobbies is a chore for me I hate my job and cannot find a new one or figure out what to do with my life I am always snippy and short tempered with my family. I did not go to my sister's birthday BBQ last night because I knew I would just bring my dread depression and misery with me. I do not think I am suicidal but it is definitely the easier option and I have considered it alot recently. I do not see much to look forward to if the world is ending and there is political mayham in almost every country. Seriously why cannot people realize we are all in this together and billionaires and corporations can fuck off. I really related to Bo Burnham's Inside and recently cannot get All Eyes on Me out of my head. I feel like this great life I had planned from when I was young got ripped away from me. what is the point of a pointless meaningless job if I am not helping people or trying to save the planet? what is the point of having kids if they will just see the end of the earth? what is the point of getting married I will just be miserable and alone forever? I do not want to live like this please make it stop. I just want the constant existential dread to stop,Depression

21510,In 2020covid happened. Living a third world country and everything is already shit. The country fell into recession. Everyone literally had no job. Then2021 came it. Covid almost gone in country. Everything started to get better. But in Februarycoup happened. The country is getting a little bit up from recession and coup dragged us down back. Everyone is dying everyday. Everyday is just pure depression. And about a week ago covid third wave happened which is alot stronger than previous waves. People dying from running out of oxygen. Sowe have to buy oxygen tanks. And thenmilitary took over almost every oxygen tank and mask manufacturers and stop manufacturing. There is no hope. I do not even how I will die. From military or covid? I hope some powerful country just nuke us and die within a second without feeling anything. I wish I could just die painlessly and peacefully.,Depression
16454,2 years ago I dropped out of school. I was at my worst point mentally and did it on impulse. Fast forward to now. All of the people I used to go to school with graduated most going into college they had parties to celebrate it all. I have sat here for 2 years I have done nothing with my life. I have improved from when I dropped out. Those issues do not bother me now. Instead I am plagued by thoughts of being an adult. I am 18 in a month. I want to get a job but I hate the idea of an unchanging schedule. Even though I am living that right now. I can get my GED but all the research I have done it seems that is not good enough. I cannot go back to high school it is too late. I have lost all connection in my life. I have no one to talk to. The online friends are all just surface level. My real friends and I stopped hanging out because of how different I am. I am alone. I care so much about so many people but because I have isolated they all think I hate them. I cannot do this anymore I am failing everyone I love.,Depression

27104,I want to preface by saying I am not sure if what she is going through at the moment is depression or anxiety because I know she has struggled with both though I think her anxiety is worse. All she said to me was that she was really struggling she has not been doing well and so that is why she has not been replying to my texts. I asked a couple of times if she wanted to talk but she kind of ignored those messages and has not mentioned anything since. she is been talking again just normally? like our regular fun conversations. She has not texted me back she said she would reply later and this was about a week ago so I do not know if she is forgotten or what but has been sending me random social media posts so we have been having little conversations here and there. I am just not sure what to do should I ask again how she is feeling? I told her I did not ask again because I did not want to push her and know she also needs alone time sometimes and yeah she did not really reply she just said a I have not been that responsive to her these past few days because I was dealing with some stuff so I feel pretty guilty. Basically I do not know if I should bring up how she is feeling if she has not? Do I just go along with the fun conversations? Struggling with how to help my depressed friend,Depression

20453,Recently my mother asked me if I was afraid of dieing. I told her part truths. The part I told her was no I am not scared of death we all are going to die at some time and it means there is no more pain or taking medication to get through the day. The part I did not share is that I actually have thoughts of ending my life daily. I would not act on it as I know it would traumatise my nephew and he calls me his best friend. Another reason is because I am scared of not being successful and ending up trapped in my body. My mind working but I am unable to communicate my wishes so I have somebody else making decisions that they believe Id want but in reality is what they would want me to want. I had a cancer scare and I decided before getting the results that I would not receive treatment as I personally believe life has been wasted on me so no death does not scare me. I am not scared of death.,Depression

These words mean nothing.He thinks to himself.They do not help.They do not soothe.So hell retire from his ink stained desk.And ask what is my worth? I have thought this since birth.if i can even walk this earthBlissful waves no doubt id surf. But what is the point If i do not even know my own worth.Shit am i even worth this shirt? Looking at you like would you anoint? But fuck it ill probably disappoint youCause there is nothing i would not do to get a piece of that joint too.

But enough of that kind of talk When i try to mix these words together All i hear is squawk squawkThats what is in my mind Because when its inclined and combined I can reach for and bind what i find To assign to a piece of paper and remindUs all of what its like to be kind to one another.Discover what life is like under no blufferAnd try to realize you too can find a lover.A lover who may not be under the coversBut smothered inside yourself. Look i just dropped that bombshell So please take your mind from off that shelf Dust it off put it in. good now does not that help? Sad Artist what is my worth,Depression

26220,I started Mirtazapine 6 days ago. I struggle to sleep and one of the things that made me want to try it was that I had heard it helps with that. The first 3 nights it acted like a sleeping pill and I went straight out. This seems to have stopped though. How long before bed should I be taking it and what is the best dosage to help you sleep. I am currently on 15mg. Also does the increased appetite ever go away? Mirtazapine?,Depression
10270,I have just finished school and my depression has never been worse. I would rather literally kill myself than working like a slave for the rest of my life. Maybe I am mentally retarded or something..But I do not see the point in doing this. Anyway I was studying med school not doctor and there is a job I could potentially apply for that probably would not be bad but I do not know if I can do that. I have zero experience and I am always nervous in new environment.. Who the hell would like to work with someone like me. Also my communicating skill is almost nonexistent. Even if they would invite me for a job interview what the hell would I tell them?!On the other hand I am ready to kill myself in 48 days so. Do these anxious thoughts even matter? Applying for a first job vs depression and social anxiety,Depression
22416,I could go on and on about this. But I will keep it brief. To me i jump from one thing to another. When i was a very little child i was exposed only to studies so i consumed myself wholly into it. Then came the TV then came the day dreaming then came sadness with binge watching and eating and alcohol and now i have she would the old skin. Now i constantly go back and forth from taking a plunge into binge watching and drowning myself in melancholy. I need to fill myself with something so consuming all the time. If i do not i crumble into pieces. So it is easy for me to use mobile because it is easy and accessible and it is normal. what is the cure? what is the fix? Can I go back to being that child addicted to studying? I have an idea on what to do and I am currently doing so much better than how i used to be. But I really need some perspective on how to deal with these tendencies of mine? As in how to feed it and keep a check on it at the same time? How to channel all the addictive tendencies into being productive?,Depression
10597,I do not know any communities where being sad but not exactly depressed. Like I do not feel like shit all the time or for long periods of time just in bursts like a mild depressed state.Whenever I get in these states I tend to think of how much I hate my lifebut I do not. I do not really feel the need to commit suicide or have a strong desire too but I do think about it I guess often but have never tried it. Maybe I am in denial but I am never talking to some therapist or even friends and family about my personal issues. I try to keep my thoughts and emotions private and confined. One thing I do feel is I have an intense desire to be alone. I feel fake like forced happiness everyday to talk to friends and my family. I just want to be alone for a long time. Sometimes I wish I had the balls to run away and disappear or just move out. But no I continue to sit at home each day playing video games and watching youtube as I have cheated on every assignment and test since I have started college. I really do not know what to do with my life I know I am a failure but I will not feel terrible tommorow. I could die tonight and I hope I am forgotten as quickly as possible I do not want anyone to know except whoever has too.But I will just be better in the morning and go along with life until I hit another depressed mood. Does anyone know what this condition is because I do not think its depression depression? I am not depressed just sad,Depression
13248,I forget a lot lately one second i know what I am doing and the other one i forget everything or parts of it which is not normal for me i forget how to do tasks and what some things mean and their names in a matter of second.Few days ago something bad happened and since then I am not okay at all I am a mess i mean i was always a mess but this is the worst it got so far so i wonder is that why this is happening to me? Can mentally hitting rock bottom make you forget the simplest things?,Depression
10042,Story of my life right? My life is on such a downward spiral and it is all my fault. I cannot handle real life responsibilities and so I just gave up on life. I have no motivation or willpower. All I do is go to work go home procrastinate and play games until I am tired cry and then do it all over again the next day. I wake up everyday and I go to the same old shitty part time minimum wage job. Everytime I try to crawl out of this pit of depression I just fall right back down. I tried improving myself with school to try and get out of my shit job but I cannot even study without being distracted and so now I am 3 weeks overdue on my homework with no desire to do homework anytime soon. I feel so guilty about it but I cannot bring myself to sit down and learn. I am severely in debt because I am an impulse shopper and I have never been in a relationship in the 24 years I have been alive on this shit hole so I have no one to even share how I feel not even family cares or understands what I am feeling either. I feel so trapped in my eternal depression cycle. There are so many things in my life that make me want to end my life but the only thing that is keeping me here is my survival instinct. I hate it here.How come everyone else seems to have their shit together but me? Why cannot I just be a normal functioning human with a normal brain? I know everyone has their baggage but why the hell does it feel like I am at the very very bottom of the barrel?Does anyone else feel the same way or relate? I want to end my life so bad but I am too scared vent,Depression

18412,Hey all first time poster here. I need some help.Not too long ago my partner suddenly decided to cutoff all relations with me and it seems she no longer wants to be associated with me anymore. Apparently this was because her friends did not approve of me or something ? she explained how she still liked me but her friends thought that I was weird despite them not even knowing me so ig she just felt embarrassed being around me and so decided to leave me. that is essentially the message I got. honestly I am still so confused. she went from totally being in love with me for awhile then decided to break up with me seemingly over night. just because her friends did not like me or whatever.I spoke to a close friend of hers about it and they had their suspicions on jealousy and peer pressure which seemed to make sense ig but they also had no idea. I was not particularly keen on them asking her about it.Idek but I am absolutely gutted. I honestly loved her so much. I have been feeling so depressed lately. I literally lack the motivation to do well anything. I have not eaten much since then and I cannot even concentrate in class properly. Its horrible. I am so confused and frustrated I literally cannot stop thinking about her. It keeps me up at night.Do you all have any suggestions for me going forward? please help me! TT I feel lost and alone,Depression
47887,I feel like you're supposed to grow as a person in life and I haven't at all I'm 23 and I am a former shell of who I was at like 16. I have no goals or ambitions anymore I used to be ambitious. I'm trying to improve like I am volunteering but I still don't have confidence or anything,Depression
14520,Hi redditors. First time posting. Dunno where else to put this.Little background I am a fit healthy mostly M23 with a history of chronic and sometimes severe depression and frequent daily suicidal thoughts with a couple minor attempts some years ago... I am not on any meds but am contemplating taking them lately.My story of my sad summer so farThis year started off pretty good finally moved out for the first time last year and have been fairly happy. Have had no luck with the girls I like even though I am apparently quite handsome. They just lose interest after a while and I have sort of given up on asking any out. Have moved into an apt. more recently with a longtime best friend from HS which has been decent enough but we are drifting apart because of typical roommate shit. I have accepted it and I am okay with it I think I would be fine without them in my life after this year. I do not have many friends otherwise though and the new people I meet are mostly temporary friends. COVID restrictions in my city have also made it tough particularly because I have not seen most of my extended family in over a year.Other than that I was having my hours gouged at work for a job and company I already hated they cut me down to 12ish hours a week before I had enough. I would had a few thousand dollars saved so decided to quit. it is been fine since then but money does not last forever and I do not have enough to support me for long. it is been a month with a little labor work on the side and I am nearly broke again. I was partying too much this summer in general so that does not help my money problem going to the beach and drinking almost every day... doing coke all night with all kinds of people. From strippers to eccentric youths I have met at said beach. Gradually I began to feel I had a problem tried to cut back and failed every time I drink I just lose all inhibition. Finally quit for maybe a couple weeks and stayed sober was tough but I am alive. Looking for a new job still maybe not looking as hard as I should then I get some bad news about my cousin that is also my age and in the same city who was partying like me and OD'd on drugs I have done before and nearly or maybe lowkey did OD'd on too... He was braindead and in hospital for a few days. Then another friend from HS few days later same thing. They died one day and the next. That was a week and a half ago I broke my sober streak pretty fast. I never tell my parents this kind of shit and it hurts talking about my cousin and friend even more especially when they say some dumb shit like how they were stupid for what they did etc... I have lost 3 friends my age to drug overdoses this year now and I think it is all just hitting me at once like the cars of a trainwreck smashing into one another and unable to stop.On the upside my best friend's birthday was this last week though I almost did not want to go but convinced myself to so I could have a good time and while on a raging bender I went with them and friends to another city to party. I think I drank almost constantly from breakfast to bed for at least 5 days straight and hardly ate a meal a day... It was a good experience all things considered I made a lot of good memories in Montreal... that entire day and night of my friend's bday in particular was like an indie film... but I do not know if I have ever gone that hard in my life and it scares me in hindsight. I was doing a few different drugs with those friends on the birthday as well literally all day and disappeared with half of the drugs to go bar hopping when they did not want to go out of the air BnB we were staying in. They were not happy and I did not have a working phone for them to call me on... or any of their phone numbers.That night was great but the day after... that hangover was the scariest I have ever had and the day before we would all left to Mtl I broke my phone after getting home with a stockpile of booze so could not call anyone. I was pretty sure I would suffer a heart attack if I got up off my couch and decidedly stayed put for the entire first day and night I was back. My heart was POUNDING from the withdrawals as I would probably taken enough alcohol and coke molly for three people. I think part of me wanted to die though I do not think I would have as I am a fit 23 year old male but... I was pretty sure I would be the next of my friends to overdose that day. I like to think this has been transformative but I am still drinking and I think I have a long way to go to get out of this rut I have dug myself into... but I have been here before. I tell myself I will not commit suicide even if it feels like it would solve all my problems and set me free because I do not want to hurt my family and friends. I feel I owe them all my life hopefully a good life. I still think of jumping from my balcony every day though.Going to see my cousin's grave tomorrow and say goodbye finally. Lots of family will be there and I will be sober. it is going to be thunder showers all day so I got an umbrella. I think it is fitting. Maybe the hard rain will wash the tears from my face and the stains from my soul. I have been crying more these past weeks than I have through my entire adult life and I am ready for it to stop. I am not religious either I still consider myself an atheist not so sure lately but I have prayed to god and asked to let me bear the burden of my family's grief so theirs might be lessened. Among other things. So I think this pain will never go away and I will just try to be strong for them and myself instead. I am not sure what I want from this post except to write about it and get it off my chest. it is been keeping me up tonight. Maybe I will start writing poetry again.So thank you for reading if you did. I hope all of you out there stay well there is beauty and meaning out there if you look for it. I have been finding much of it lately just do not expect it to fall into your lap. Go out and find it. there is all kinds of wonderful things out there just waiting for someone to stand witness. My Summer of Sadness,Depression
26248,I am 21 and have really bad depression and anxiety problems. I usually work a lot to occupy my time but I have days off coming up. How do I actually relax and enjoy my time and enjoy what I like to do? How to relax and enjoy things?,Depression
9149,22F I was turned off from sex after a very disappointing dateencounter where I know I did not want to have sex and did not like the person. I wanted company so I made the mistake of going back to his place for tea. We did other things and I drew the line on intercourse. He did not get the message or did not care and kept trying to get me to give in. I did I was tired and feeling pretty unworthyunlovable. I did not want to be alone missed feeling wanted and felt generally if not him now then who later. I beat myself up over this for too long and worked through the shame of it all.My sex drive is pretty high so during this time it is kind of added to my depression but I think it is good that I took a time out. Now I am genuinely in a headspace where I want to only worry about myself and be selfish with my desires.How bad for my mental health would it be for me to look for someone to strictly just have sex with and not do the whole this is who I am who are you and do we match thing? I have always done it and it is basically only ever exhausted me.I know my worth yaddayadaya I am horny and sad is this going to be detrimental overall undo healing? Is there a healthy way to do this for me? I have been sexless for a year,Depression

16538,Hello I am seeking advice for my depressionaddiction. Growing up I was bullied until the end of high school and my strict religious parents created a very stressful and traumatic upbringing at home. I have always had an unshakeable feeling of low self worth and I always feel like nobody likes me. I always have to go above and beyond for people to like me but others seemingly do nothing and have people adore them. In addition I have an over obsessive addiction to things that stimulate me. It ranges from food moviestv theme parks etc no alcohol or drug addictions. Really just anything that prevents me from sitting with myself and my thoughts. Literally I cannot do anything without simultaneously eating a snack or listening to music or a podcast or something to stimulate me and make me feel happy. I am addicted to this self induced false sense of happiness because its the only time I really ever feel happy. Over the years I have made excusesgoals to help me with my depression and low selfesteem. First I blamed it on my weight then my lack of education then my finances then being single and alone etc. Present day I have my own place I got fit completed multiple degrees have a great paying career I am in a 6 year committed relationship and I have even mended my strained relationship with my family. Honestly I have a great life and I have run out of excuses. HOWEVER my self worth is as low as ever and I still feel like people do not like me or think the ones that do will leave me the second I do something wrong or upset them. I have been seeing a therapist for 2 years and it has helped me to better understand the root of my behaviors but no luck finding a solution. I am continuously told to try positive affirmations but no matter how much I repeat to myself you are smart you are worthyetc or how many lists i write with my positive traits nothing changes. I am not suicidal or anything like that and when I reflect like I stated earlier I am aware I have a great life but the thought of living the rest of my life and never being truly happy or loving myself is so scary and I do not know what to do.Anyone in a similar situation or have advice? Thank youPS I have never taken meds. I always avoided medication and thought of it as my last resort but I am starting to consider them. Any advice or personal experience stories about meds would be greatly appreciated Depression low self esteem HELP!,Depression
11669,I have let my depression dig me into a deep financial hole. I am trying to fix it but i keep having set backs. Every time i get back on my feet or get out the hole a bit something comes along and pushes me deeper. I get its my fault all of it. But it still hurts. I should have paid my insurance premiums on time and i would not be facing an uncovered accident on a car I am severely upside down on. I got the car pre pandemic lost my high paying job and have not been able to recover. My fridge has busted twice leaving me with no food. Bill collectors call me and tell me how irresponsible I am for getting a car i cannot afford but i could when i got the car. I just want to die i do not have the energy to fight anymore. I do not see a way out,Depression
9347,Honestly I thought I was doing better I am on meds at least. But I just have no motivation to shower. What for? I have no friends or life since I isolated myself so much when I was at my lowest and I am stuck in a job I hate that I do not feel the need to keep up appearances for. Its disgusting obviously but I do not know how to fix it. I only shower once a week,Depression

18723,I spend most of my time with family. I love them but I do not like hanging out with family members all of the time. It gets draining especially with some of the toxic family dynamics going on. All of my other friends either no longer live in my city or they have their own tight work schedules.I have tried clubbing at least three different times. I did not like it. I cannot force myself to have fun at clubs so I have acknowledged that I just do not like clubbing and there is nothing wrong with that. I have also tried online dating but I do not like that either. So I gave up on using OLD apps and sites. they are too frustrating.I go on solo adventures in my city but it gets lonely at times. I just wish I had someone to hang out with. I do not care about their gender just as long as its someone outside of my family. I wish I had someone to hang out with,Depression

7991,I have been with my partner for nearly 3 yrs now and we have never once had sex hes been really patient with me. While we have never had vaginal intercourse we have done other things and I sometimes struggle with depression bringing down my libido. But for weeks now I have been struggling having any sort of intimacy with him. Last time I broke down crying as we made out with his body over me he did not notice as the lights were out. And he began to move his hands and the combination of anxiety and fear of him feeling my cuts started self harming recently made me run I left immediately and told him I could not do it. Prior to that I have had tears run down before but this time it was more and I felt as if I was suffocating. I love him and I am attracted to him but when this happens it feels like I am not there almost like I am just watching myself but I have no control over my body. I know I can tell him to stop at any moment but it feels as if I am mute and cannot bring myself to do so. He does not even know I struggle with depression no one does he just thinks I am saving myself or waiting for the right time. We were relatively young when we started dating as well so it makes sense that we have not had any relations during the 3 yrs. its scary when I disassociate I know hes someone I trust and love but it feels like rape in a way. I am not comparing the two but I do feel powerless and its not even his fault. I cannot be intimate,Depression
22112,It feels awful seeing all the people my age having the best times with friends doing stuff meanwhile i live in the middle of nowhere abusive bigotted alcoholic parents that never teached me any social skills so I am socially awkward lonely as hell i just want a good friend but i cannot make one I am gay but i cannot come out it feels like prison i do not have the strength to keep in touch with people i do not have motivation to do anything i do not want to work a job i hate capitalism i want to do music because it is become my only escape. I do not have a point in going forward,Depression
9814,I will make it short it is late for me.I absolutely love school and other activities I am kind of the popular kid in school teachers love me since 1st grade I have never been in a fight and always get good notes I am smart talk a lot and even offered myself as a teacher.And now what is the problem? Well I will try to make it even shorter.I am the only son of my family I have no brothers... well I have got two siblings but they almost never come close to us unless they need money for spending in some shit instead of studying so that leaves me as the only one in the house and to be honest I always fantasize about having a sister that comprehends me and that loves me as a brother fcking obviously that would care about my problems that would help me in my life and that would talk to me but the only thing I have is a dog that is too old to go for a walk.To add information to what is above I always wanted a real friend someone who is there for me for talking or hanging out someone who likes the same things as me and does not ignore me like many friends I have when I want to talk all they do is ghost me...To finish this thingy I recently fell in love with someone a very cute girl shy likes almost the same things as me she is perfect for me I evem walked with her to her home once and she liked it I am planning to talk privately with her to compliment her and try to demostrate that I want her to be 'more than a friend' But I am afraid afraid of scaring her afraid of being alone with no love...The reason why I am posting this here is because no one'd listen no friends of mine would keep a conversation about this without ghosting me this is my only place to open up to some people.

47948,Recently realised Im depressed and I dont know how to help myself. HelloIm just looking for any ideas of how to help myself really. I realised a few weeks ago that Im depressed. Mainly because Im a general failure at life really but Ive also had a couple of traumatic incidents in the past. I sleep all the time I eat fast food and chocolate and I just never seem to FEEL anything except annoyance. Im on sertraline have been for years for anxiety but I still feel this way. The NHS website says to exercise but I dont want to do that and Im also hypermobile which makes it difficult to exercise. I want to get better but I dont really know how If anyone has got any advice on how to help myself I would really appreciate it.P.S I do not currently have any thoughts that I would be better off dead.

9766,Hello I am a 17yr old bisexual male in india. The last few months I was feeling really sick but did not have any symptoms so my friend asked me to take a couple of psych tests and they all came back saying I am moderately depressed or severely depressed. I have been feeling suicidal for about 3years now ever since I faced bullying in my old school and was hospitalized for liver failure because I tried to kill my self with pills. This was 3 years ago. Every thing since then has felt extra. I lately have not been able to do anything about it because of my studies. I cannot seek help because if i tell my parents they will simply discard it saying it is an excuse not to study they are wired that way and I do not have enough money on my own to seek help indipendently. I am clueless as to what I am supposed to do Advice pls,Depression
25376,I did have horrible childhood trauma and some shitty memories and a shitty time where i did not have anything and YEARS later I finally found happiness and I finally had a console and a laptop that can play games that made me happy and felt kind of independent and was pursuing my dream job and then LIFE took many of it away because now I have a disorder called hyperacusis which makes me sensitive to sound so its hard to take walks outside ..I cannot listen to music ..and I have to play video games on mute which is ..okay i guess i can..still play probably but the soundtrack and voice acting are half of the game SO now I am just miserable and depressed and do not know if I can even work in the future. but let us not talk about the future. I am miserable now. fucking miserable. And none of my friends understand they think I am being a weak person because my disorder is ... invisible. back to being suicidal again. Barely had 2 happy years. now I am suicidal again. I am still so young. but ill be suicidal forever i think...and it feels like this will only get worse. Maybe I am wrong. maybe. but i do not think so. FUCKING HATE how life can be so fucking cruel . I never asked for any of this. Life can take everything away,Depression

15700,Hey so as the title says I feel like I am in some way broken. Therapy is not really changing that even though I have been going through it for multiple years. Below I will list some of the reasons I think I am broken. Therapy has stopped making any significant change to my state after a certain point I lose interest in any hobbies or potential interests very quickly I have enormous problems with laziness I fail to do basic things such as cleaning my room buying myself clothes making myself food etc. For that reason I lack any sort of skill or knowledge that would be useful to my future life. I struggle with education. I find my world view to be constantly proven wrong and I lack the energy to do much research I have trouble formulating my own opinions I just parrot other people Social interactions are hard for me I am very awkward in person. I fail to notice any subtle social cues and undertones. Building skills is difficult for me I spend the vast majority of my time gaming yet I am bad at any game I play and I fail to improve significantly over time I seem to be very unintelligent. I often find myself having trouble with solving simple life issues. I also cannot focus very well I am doing terribly in terms of driving despite something around 40 hours behind the wheel I sleep a lot to avoid thinking or feeling bad. I am generally sleepy more than the average person I rely on my parents to do pretty much everything related to chores and general life stuff for me I am 18. There are more things but off the top of my head that is what I have got. Does anybody feel this way? Am I really inherently broken and unable to succeed? What do you think about all this? Have a great day! I feel like my life is fucked and I am broken beyond repair. long post,Depression

My situation in my home is really bad for myself. Life is just pain for me. I take a lot of medication for my depression but I still feel like shit. My life in the last 2 years has been just obligations with no reward. Doing basic things like having a basic hygiene eat or doing sport which I use to enjoy feels like a super effort to me. But I never got a reward I never feel happy. I do not have friends I have people with whom I go out but I would not consider them as friends behave like a normal person hiding my depression with them is also a big effort. I have never kiss a girl. I also cut myself frequentlyAfter this time I am considering ending this pain you know what I mean. Doing things just because is what you should do is killing me.

Thanks I do not know how to scape from my situation,Depression

25250,Its been years of depression. My upbringing was beyond fucked at some points. My last 3 bedrooms have looked like a fucking dump. One of which I have to have clean in 3 days so I am far beyond overwhelmed right now. My mom went to prison and I have not seen her in well over a year because of covid. My life is a mess I am in my early 20s but I have the work ethic and mentality of an 18 year old. I smoke weed I binge drink I do pills. I am not suicidal but I would not mind dying that is for sure. Its amazing how much life can throw at you at once. I do not understand anymore.,Depression

I do not want to forget her. it is messing with my productivity at work I am not sleeping I just drone on. I do not know when the healing begins I just keep pretending. I needed somewhere to say this. To admit it to myself. I cannot shake it.,Depression
16516,I am on a family trip in New York and I forgot my medication. I had gone back onto it a week prior to the vacation but forgot it while packing. I do not get home for another week and I am already miserable. I feel devoid of energy and life and am so frustrated with myself. I leave for college in a month and feel like I am wasting my final days. On top of this I am going through sort of a breakup and I already feel like an emotional burden to my friends and family. I have journaled but I have nowhere else to go for help. My last journal entry was suicidal and I am just very dissapointed in how pathetic I am. I am so fucking depressed,Depression
17042,I am pissed off I cannot kill myself because of my family. Why the fuck do people have to care? Why cannot they just find a new person to place their hopes in? Because of them I have to live with this piece of shit life and this piece of shit person I am and pretend everythings fine. I would seriously do it. If I just could not see their faces during those last moments in my mind. I feel everyone is clinging to my ankles. My family is the ball and chain to this reality. I should consider myself lucky I even have people in my life that love me. But Love is just another burden to carry and It was a mistake to care for me. I will always hate myself and other people and this world. Just a waste of space resources energypotential. Just a shame. Why do some people care?,Depression

27274,So i have been reading about side affects and people are saying talking about the insomnia and luckily i have not had anything bad just a headache. But I am only on day 3 and to be honest I am feeling ok. So my question is when should i take this prozac. I take it in the morning right now and its making me drowsy and sleepy but I am thinking this is just a side affect and maybe i should keep taken it in the morning untill this side affects go away. But on the other hand I am thinking should i take it at night. But if the drowsiness is just a side affect and it goes away then i should not take it at night because of the insomnia side affect. I am really confused on this.. Has anyone experience this any help would be very appreciated. I hope you can understand what I am trying to say. Can someone help me with this decision about prozac.,Depression
18524,I'v been crippled with depression and anxiety since my early teens and it had a catastrophic impact on my life.I am now early 30s and recently started antidepressants i cannot help looking back at my past and compare myself to others.I had no social life or professional one for the past 15 years my whole life is like a big steamy crater after a nuke there is nothing but sadness and despair.

19812,I am looking for a good book to read and learn from. Something that can help me learn how to be in more control in how I respond to daily life criticism uncomfortable or threatening scenarios and just general positive andor negative conversations.About me I am someone who has been clinically diagnosed with PTSD with Anxiety attacks depression and general anxiety. I was raised in an emotionally and physically abusive home and suffered throughout life as a kid. Honestly it felt like i was bullied and abused most of my life. Since becoming an adult and I am more self aware and I really want to turn things around! After being clinically diagnosed I decided to pursue therapy. I was in therapy for a couple years but I ended up losing the privilege of having access to therapy due to insurance and being broke. I really do not want to take medication but its getting to the point that idc anymore and i just want to be drugged up. I really really hate how much I struggle with my mental health and I want to have this bitch in check and not let my surroundings or other ppl in my head. At one point in my life before covid I felt like I had most of it under control. Sure I had my bad days still but nothing like before. With the pandemic i feel my mental health has gradually gotten worse again. I freak out with certain triggers i get scared of what ppl think or say of me and its even harder when it feels the worlds against me when receiving harsh criticism. Ex my mother says things like this is why bad shit happens to you or now i understand why you got abused After I calm down from my panic attacks I always feel so defeated and even worse. I end up isolating myself and just crying the rest of the day and laying in bed until the next day because I cannot stop replaying my life history. I WANT THAT TO STOP. I just want to learn how to stop letting things get to me. Basically learn to be careless or not care for all the right reasons. Sorry if my post is all over the place. I just had a breakdown right before typing this. TIA Any good booksreads to recommend? Any helpful advice even?,Depression

16415,This is regarding a family member sisterinlawin their 30s with both physical and mental limitations on top of severe depress. They have hydrocephalus and multiple surgeries have left her with deficits both mentally and physically. She is probably cognitively equivalent to a 15 year old and has a great sense of humor and personality.Lately she has been gaining quite a bit of weight 54 and 300ish lbs which has in concert with her physical disabilities made it very difficult for her to get around and she now has an even more significant risk of falling.Her mother does not purposefully enable her and is an excellent care taker but putting her on a diet is next to impossible because she is very picky and has been known to self harm if she does not get her way. Its safe to assume she has around six sodas a day. Switching to diet is not an option in her mind and The only alternative for drinks is juice and for sugar Gatorade. I am concerned she will become diabetic if she is not already. Another serious concern is that her mother will no longer be able to provide care for her if she cannot move her. Her mother is in her 60s and has her own health issues. She very regularly strained her back trying to help her daughter off the ground or couch. Even navigating the world with her daughter in a wheelchair is physically difficult for her mother.Does anyone have any tips success stories advice on how to approach this? I love her tremendously and I am concerned about her quality of life if we do not change the path we are on. we have considered the fact that if things do not turn around we may have to find an institution for her but she has so many medical problems that it would be difficult to arrange and it would be a total betrayal of trust.

13724,19 yo man. First off Id like to make it clear I do not have suicidal thoughts and would never even think about it as an option. Ever since around sophomore or junior year I have been changing drastically. I stopped socializing outside of my friend group and I thought that was just me maturing. While I do still think that is the case I realize it goes deeper than that. I do not even know what caused it but I have felt either sad or mad almost everyday since. This past week I met a girl visiting my city and we really hit it off. I mean she was really fucking special I have never connected like that with anyone so quick before. I did not realize it at the time but for that week that she was here I was already feeling back to my normal self. That was last week and we have not been talking much since but that is not really what bugs me I mean I live on west coast and she is on the east so it was not going to work out. But I have slipped back into my sad self since she left and that is when I realized this is not my normal something is wrong with me. I think what happened was I experienced true happiness for the first time in years and now that she is gone its gone and I am so fucking tired of feeling like this on a daily basis. I do not want my happiness to revolve around other people tho that is why I am writing this. I want to learn to be happy by myself but I do not know how to go about it. I have been feeling really empty this past year and I do not know what to do with my life I feel so stuck. While taking a shower tn I cried for the first time in a long long time and that really set me over the edge. I do not ever cry so once I did I realized its time to turn my life around. How can I learn to love myself when I hate the person I have become in comparison to the me from 5 years ago Realized I am depressed today please help,Depression
11569,I have been getting depressed lately due to some issues with work. If you have ever read about administrative burdens increasing physician burnout during COVID times it is exactly that. I feel like this is a situation where therapy will not help because it does not change the fact that I have been getting screwed by policy changes and other things I have no control over. I will not get into more about the situation here because it is a long complex and specific situation. I have tried everything I can to resolve the issue and manage my own attitudes but I know deep down that until the issue that is contributing to my depression is resolved I will not feel better.I have kind of hinted at my state of mind to several people and they did not seem to pick up on it but then one guy did and said I need to get help. Is therapy really going to do anything when the underlying because is still there and I think I am already managing the things I do have control over including my stress levels and the depression as well as I possibly can? Are there situations where therapy will not help?,Depression
15267,My parents divorced when I was like 5 and I would have visitation with my dad. He would always take me around with girls he met off Facebook to try impress them and by chance their own children if they had any. On weekends that he would not drag me out with him to meet the women he would talk to he would take me to the park or something but he would never actually play with me. He would stay in the car chatting with women I would practically have to beg him to come play with me only to be ignored. he would often even prioritize the womens children over me in order to gain their favor its so hard watching your own parent treating someone elses child the way they should be treating you. he would always make empty promises like coming to my 6th grade promotion or my 8th grade graduation or any important event in my life. I have gotten to the point where I have accepted that he will not even be attending my high school graduation currently a junior. His emotional and mental abuse has stuck with me and affects so many parts of my life that it is so miserable. Its extremely difficult for me to keep close friends especially one that I guess could be considered a favorite person. Because my brain will twist the slightest hint of drifting apart into oh they are replacing you they are leaving you because of how I perceive if my dad can leave anyone can. I recently had an episode with my best friend where I felt as if I was being replaced and went into a self destructive state where I SH and ghosted them because I did not want to get hurt but ended up hurting them. My brain can twist things and make me overthink the smallest thing because of insecurity of being alone due to multiple instances of my father leaving me alone to go see his girlfriends or whatever. It makes everyday so difficult and I just want to be able to not be so afraid of being alone and or replaced. Dealing with emotional abuse from childhood,Depression
20795,i refuse to acknowledge when i need help and when i do need help the idea of asking for it is mortifying. case in point I am currently at my dads for a month and i just started my period but instead of asking my dad to get pads I am just sucking it up and using toilet paper ... tmi i know but all the same its annoying. I am not embarrassed per se that i need pads i just hate relying on people for things I am too damn independent,Depression
8005,Lately I have been having some issues with my head and my heart medically and with that I have noticed I have been more depressed. I have explained more of it on my profile about the heart and headache issues but I have been feeling down extremely. I am worried that time flies by snd before I know it I am going to be dead I am scared of growing up because of the challenges I am going to face the losses I will go through and the constant fear of getting something like cancer I am pretty young but it just feels like so much of my life has gone to waste and I am just overall scared and I want to be comfortable and I am scared of starting to become an adult and starting my life. I feel like its way to stressful and lifes going to be over before I know it because it seems like everybody around me is getting cancer and everything and I am hearing about people dying on the news and I do not want that to be me. I do not know how to stay positive and enjoy life so what I am basically saying is i hate waiting for death. I just want to enjoy life what can I do? My doctor wants to prescribe me with anxiety medication because she noticed that its horrible btw. I just want to feel happy and normal and enjoy life. I am struggling and I really need help.,Depression
11197,Hi I diagnosed with depression a few years ago and have attempted to commit suicide a few times before and luckily all of them failed. I am still undergo therapy in these challenging times online and it seems to get better. I still have suicidal tendencies but the frequency is not as much.I do not have much friends because I have a weird behaviour and some people do not like that I am someone with mental health issue. I like to make jokes to make people happy when I see people happy I become happy. But sadly not everyone like my jokes. I do not make any offensive jokes but some of my jokes can be lame at times. For example that movie was Eggcelent !. Some people really do like it and genuinely laugh.I also asked a lot of questions regarding social life and it seems to make some people annoyed and complained about me. The questions I ask are simple questions such as Do you think my shirt is alright to go to the event ?. But people can ask me a lot of question regarding ukulele but no one ever said anything about it ! I once lash out before that why you guys get angry when I ask questions when I answer all of your questions politely. They replied with my questions all the ukulele questions are good questions and my questions are all stupid questions.There are cases too where people seen me entering or exiting a mental health facilities and people became uncomfortable with me saying I am very dangerous. There are times where when I go somewhere in an event. The parents shield their small child away from me . I never heard anyone before and this really make sad at times.I have been with seven groups of friends across five years and all of them end up badly. It is always the game event. One or two people in the group dislike me and other group member begin to exclude me in everything to maintain the group harmony.I do not have any friends now and my family are miles away and I cannot travel back due to the pandemic travel restriction. I begin to hallucinate imaginary friends recently like I make two lunch and imagine I am talking to someone across the table I am not sure if this is healthy.Recently my therapist got Covid and we will not have sessions for at least a month. She is getting well and just need some rest. How do I overcome the feeling of always being hated by one person in a group thus making any group relationship almost impossible.,Depression

I do not see the point in living if I am not able to be independent... It hurts so much it is unbearable...

26202,There are cases where I am asked as to why I am not active in the dating world and why I do not shoot my shot. I tell myself that I am simply not ready. Yet it stems from several factors. Not ready to be rejected not ready to lose a friend not ready to stir up any traumas from past relationships and so on.But when will I ever be ready? First of all I want to be ready for myself to be happier enjoy things and reconnect. Yet I keep spiraling into self deprecation and constant doubt. It feels empty I know I cannot be ready if I do not acknowledge myself. But I really cannot find a reason as to why I like me.

15155,This is probably the most common title but I do need help. I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for more than a year now but in the last 2 months its been spiralling out of control. I have been pushing myself away from others being disconnected from my friends and family as I have only showed a fake side of me my entire life and every second thought being I want to die with my only emotion being worthlessness. Everything that goes wrong I either blame others or I call myself a disappointment. Everything I have told myself to build up my confidence and self belief I now realise was a lie as I pushed everything down until it was nothing other than a foggy memory and just seemed like me overreacting. I do not know what to do and the only thing keeping me from killing myself is my indecisiveness and the fact that I am scared. If any one can offer me advise please answer. I need help,Depression
8583,I am not trying to make some edgy post about how I want to do drugs and shit but I do not think its something you can say without coming across like that so whatever. But I do not know I just want to do heroin really badly right now. I guess I am just sick of feeling so shitty and I am sick of nothing working to make it better. All the medications I have been on have done sweet fuck all and I have been through dozens at this point. Therapy has not helped me at all and I just feel awful all the time. I feel like I do not belong in the world at all and yet I am forced to exist in it. So I keep cycling between two thoughts constantly that I want to kill myself or that I want to do heroin. I do not know why but I really REALLY want to try heroin,Depression
16618,I have been feeling the void feeding on the brighter parts of the self for the last 5 years. I have been secretly setting up dates to end this date with eternity but I keep procrastinating on it everytime the family witnesses a setback. I have zero energy to persevere. it is not like I love my family either it is primarily Stockholm syndrome. it feels worst because before the abyss stared into me I was gifted in academic prowess confidence humour etc. I was a needle walk away from the self titled ubermensch. Mentally I have been imprisoned in a cycle of self sabotage. I feel like ending instead of being trapped in a bubble slowly incinerating my skin with every waking hour. I sketch pictures of stress picturesque,Depression
48160,Being born mortal is worse than not having been born in the first place. My mortality recently hit me for real and it's been sending me into a deep depression. Everything feels utterly pointless because no matter how well I live I'll die and not remember any of it. There won't be any legacy of me since the universe itself will die in the end. Nothing has any point to it we're just here to plug our ears and pretend that we're never going to die despite also being certain of it. My whole life just fell apart and now I can barely enjoy things knowing it'll all be gone. I keep mourning my friends and family knowing everything I do with them amounts to nothing. No professional help or medication can change these things. Existence is just a prison where they dangle all these wonderful things in front of you and then remind you that you'll be dead and none of it will have mattered. There's no afterlife no legacy nothing. This feels like the cruelest joke imaginable. I have zero motivation to pursue a career knowing it's all for nothing. I can barely enjoy my hobbies knowing they're just a distraction and won't be remembered by anyone.,Depression

15224,I feel sad and alone with nobody that really cares about me. Every day I think about ending my life and I tell myself that it is only a matter of time. People say there is always hope and all you need is something to hold onto. There is very little in my life that is worth holding onto. It seems like every opportunity in my life I have lost or for whatever reason it has been taken away from me. My health is not great and it is not getting better it is going to do me in eventually. I do not do drugs except the ones I am prescribed and I do not drink.A lot of the time I feel trapped inside myself and inside a life I do not want. I have stopped leaving home not unless I have to and I just want to get back home as soon as I can. I do not feel comfortable being around people any more.I unfriended just about everybody who is not family on Facebook and I closed my account a day or so ago. It sucks that I have so little to share with anyone and nothing in common. Mostly I just share music videos and random stuff that no one is interested in.There is no one close to me except my elderly mother who I live with. She cares about me and she is probably my only reason for hanging on. it is going to be hard managing without her because I really depend on her. I feel pathetic admitting it.It feels good to share maybe I am looking for attention I tired of this stuff weighing me down all the time. There is so much more to my story and maybe I will share it I do not know. I saw an AA meeting on TV the support group and the whole sponsor thing and I wondered why there is not something like that for someone like me. I do not like therapy I am done with it. It does not work especially when you know that there is a cutoff point to the sessions. Lack of funding. It feels like they do not give a dam until you try to hurt yourself or someone else. Not until you become a problem and they are forced to deal with you.At least if I can share stuff here with you guys and get stuff out of my system. Maybe it will make me feel a bit better. Thanks for reading this. I am feeling tired.,Depression

14810,Every day at some point I have a weird moment where I feel like I am going through the motions and i feel like my life is going faster than I can control it. It feels as though events are happening and I do not have the means to control any of it. I feel as though it is flashing before me and all I can do is watch helplessly. For a long time now I have struggled with finding pleasure in a lot of things. All of the things that used to make me happy seem to have fizzled out. Trying new hobbies seems too much of an effort and daunting task. Most of them that I research I do not have much of an interest in nor the mental capacity to try them. I have finished college. Have my dream truck. Make great money. Have a nice house. Have pets. Have a long term relationship. No material things are placed on a pedestal...I just do not seem to have much satisfaction in my achievements or activities. I am so emotionally exhausted after work that its very tough to dig myself out of this place. Prescribed Medicine seems to dull it temporarily and I only have 1 friend who somewhat understands how I feel. do not know where to start. do not know what to do. Its been like this so long I have burnt myself out thinking about it. The only thing that gets rid of it is constantly staying busy or sleep...sometimes...Any advice on those who have also experienced this and came out of it would be appreciated. Stuck in the fog,Depression

7863,I do not want to be dead I just do not want to live in this world. I love being conscious and being able to experience existence but this world has thrown nothing but pain at me time and time again. Life here is so mundane and unfulfilling. Its such a sick joke. I wish I did not have to waste away here. I want the freedom to live a life that I was meant to one that does not have to be perfect but is fulfilling at the very least. I am constantly thinking that if I die here maybe Ill be able to start anew in a different world. But there is no way for me to know. I might just cease to exist. As sucky as that may be I can accept it since my pain will end along with me. But I do not know it its worth putting my family and friends through such a heavy loss. I do not want to fade away. I do not want to stop existing. But I also do not want to stay here. I wish I could just go where I was meant to go. I want to live a life of my own image. Please. Someone help me. Repost because I need help I do not want to cease to exist. I just want a new life.,Depression
9264,I have dealt with chronic depression from a very young age I am currently 31yrs old. There have been times in the past where I though I was as bad as I could get. Felt that hopeless despair and apathy. Rock bottom.The depths to which my depression could truly sink was discovered two weeks ago. There was no catalyst for this change everything simply got completely unmanageable. My current mental state is much worse than I could have ever imagined possible. Every minute of every day feels like physical pain. No brief moments of relief what so ever. Nothing can distract me. No desire to continue on. I always used to pride myself on being strong in the face on my depression that suicide was never an option not for me. In these past two weeks my suicidal ideation has been strong. Thinking of family and loved ones no longer steers me clear of this option. This is truly a scary place to be and I fear I am losing myself entirely. I do not know what I am looking for here perhaps just a place to speak my peace. Much love reddit stay strong. My chronic depression has recently transformed into something far worse than its ever been.,Depression
18675,I secretly hope that this is all just a bad dream and when I die here I will just wake up to a life.

21705,I do not feel like I was ever meant to live. that is why none of this ever made me feelthe past was a lie. If it was truth it would have stayed but nothing does.

I do not want to fail at trying so I just keep my head up and just go through the motions of life but it is exhausting.

15752,M 22Ive been feeling off and have been feeling as if I am in peoples way. I feel like I do not do anything right for anybody and that I am just a constant bother to many. Everything seems to be a blurfoggy and I have no energy but feel guilty only because my girlfriend reminds me that I get enough sleep I eat enough I feel as if I have nothing to be Depressed about but I still fall into that category even with everything going alright around me. I do not know what is going on with me lately but I have been drinking more after I am done my shifts at work I feel happy only when I am drinking and everything else around me has me feeling with an attitude of meh I know these things are wrong or at least feel wrong because others around me constantly say there is nothing to be sad about or you are good you seem happy on the outside or etc but I do not know what else to feel other than numb on the inside I guess.It feels good to write these thoughts down instead of lashing out at people or worse bottle them up inside. But at the same time I just need to find that first step into getting better and more stable mentally. Anyone have any ideas where I could start? Thanks. Not Feeling Like Myself Lately,Depression

15651,I am at fucking breaking point.. I seriously cannot stand it I am not strong enough to go through another week. I cannot be taken for granted anymore I cannot be treated like this anymore I cannot be a fucking punching bag for the people I love anymore... I do not have it in me anymore its over I cannot fucking do it!! I want to fucking die.. I do not see a way forward I do not see the point anymore. I am so full of anger there is so much I want to say to certain people in my life but I am too scared of what they will do or say to me. They would not physically harm me but the things they say the isolation then after it I am already so lonely if I say how much they fucking hurt me they will either ignore me for days or not see me for weeks and I cannot handle that!! I have already been so alone through all the lock downs for the 14 months.. I do not know how to let them say the horrible shit they do and just take it on the chin. I used to lash back. I used to fight back but now I am broken. I will end up fully alone if I fight back anymore If I stand up for myself I will end up alone with my thoughts. My thoughts will be the end of me. I will have to remember all the trauma that is happened in the past. I will be alone with nothing to take my mind off it.. But if I stay quiet then I will not be alone and ill get to escape this pain for another kind of pain. Only.. I do not know which is worse anymore. I feel invisible... No one actually knows just HOW much they hurt me with the things they say. Now I want to hide from the people I love most because they make me hate myself more than I already do. The worst part is.. They have not said anything to me that I have not already said to myself... No one hates me more than I do.. But hearing them also say the things I have said to myself?? Well I guess I had a sliver of hope that it was not that way. But it is. The only way I will make it is if I disconnect... I have started already and I think people are starting to notice they say things like oh I wish you could talk to me about how you are feeling it is a shame you cannot vent to me.. but what do they honestly fucking expect.. They have seen how unhappy I am when I say how I feel they fight with me over it!!!!! I do not know why I am writing this.. I do not want attention I do not want to seem like I am an attention seeker but I guess this feels like a diary.. I know this is all over the place I am just saying what is in my head at this point. I can say what I feel and no one knows who I am. No one will ever know. Jesus fucking christ I do not think I can do this anymore....,Depression
13391,Sorry I am kind of ranting but I am really at my wits end. I have 0 friends to talk to. I attempt to make friends and when I manage too I end up pushing them away. I feel like I lackincapable of learning the skills to have healthy friendships. I have 0 ambitions goals or dreams. I play video games to distract myself but that does not last long. So instead I waste all my money on food and eat until I pass out.that is all my life is. I am too scared to kill myself and I realize the impact it might have on my mom if I were too but I feel like I have reached the equivalent of being dead while being alive. I do not really know what to do anymore and I just feel like this is going to be life for me because I do not have the strength to climb out. Its hard at the age of 23 to feel like this is it. I just want to be able to be happy without the requirement of someone else to give me the self worth I cannot.Why do I hate myself so much and when will I ever have the energy or passion to do anything. I do not want to live like this anymore I do not really know anymore.,Depression

13217,So this might be a very weird title and probably an even weirder story but I am going to share it with you anywaySince 2018 I have been a big fan of a band Iron Maiden. You might have heard of them since they are pretty popular. I started listening to this band when I was still in school and decided to go to a concert with my dad which originally would take place in the summer on 2019. Now with the corona and all it got postponed to the summer of 2022 already. As of late I feel like I might be obsessed with Iron Maiden maybe in a good way but not necessarily. I love their music very much seen every DVD and love to read interviews and stories about them. Iron Maiden helped me through a tough time last year when someone very close to me got hospitalised with Covid19 and almost died because of it. Luckily that person survived and is still with us which I am grateful for every day of my lifeampx200BBut now the reason why I wanted to share my story in this subreddit Iron Maiden are a very old band. they have been going since the 80's already and their oldest member is 69 at the moment. I have only become a fan of them in 2018 meaning I missed out on so much. I could not have been there since the beginning since I was born in 1998. But the things I missed make me feel miserable. The great journeys the band had the amazing adventures they went on and I missed it all.To add to this they announced a new album coming in September 2021 the 17th album to be exact. Rejoice you would say right? Well wrong. I feel very sad and would almost call it depressed. I hardly sleep and I cannot find fun in the little things anymore like playing a game or going on trips with my girlfriend. Every time I read something about Iron Maiden or watch a video DVD I get so sad since they are at the end of their career and I have only been there for such a short while. I want to be so excited for the upcoming album and support the band on perhaps their last tour but I just cannot.I know this probably all sounds very stupid and you are probably scratching your heads on why I make such a big deal out of this. And to be perfectly honest I am wondering the same thing. I feel so stupid that I feel this way but I do not know what I can do to stop it. The realisation that my favourite band might quit in a few years is something I cannot accept.My girlfriend nor my parents do not really seem to get it either. They know I am an avid Iron Maiden fan but they do not get why I am so sad when talking about the end of their career. it is not like they make fun of me for feeling this way it is just like they think it is weird that it means so much to me. I sometimes think I might be autistic since it bothers me this much.ampx200BI do not know if there is any advice that would help me but I wanted to share my feelings right here. Iron Maiden will always stay with me but I am so afraid that I might fall in a very deep depression once they announce the end and that is something I do not want. I have a beautiful girlfriend with whom I plan to have children in the future and grow old together. I cannot let them down because of something like this but I am so scared it is going to happen..... I feel like I am depressed because of my favourite band,Depression
12121,I still feel like shit... but I am okay for now.A week ago I was already planning what to write in my suicide letter and how I was going to go about the whole thing. But this weeks I realized I did not want to loose yet. it is okay if I fail. I will have another chance. It still feels like a huge weight on my chest. it is still not easier to carry but now I have the resolve to get find the strength to carry it. Getting better,Depression

22694,there is someone I am dating who I love very much. I became aware early on that he suffered from poor mental health but I did not realize the extent of it until about a month ago. I learned over the past several weeks that he has long been passively suicidalI understand that to be the term for him not wanting to kill himself but not really interested in preventing his death either. Lately hes come up with a plan to end his life if he cannot find a way to accomplish a financial goal after a certain amount of time.Just to be transparent I do not suffer from depression at least not in the way those who post here do. I might be able to learn and understand the concepts around it but I do not understand what its like to feel what he feels and I am trying to help him.I have been struggling over the past month to deal with this information. I have been feeling pretty devastated over this since I first learned about it. I have been trying my best to say everything I can to get him to change his mind even at the risk of him hating me but his mind is set. He has been taking medication but says it has not worked for awhile and yet refuses to get it updated or seek treatment. If he misses time at the gym even just a couple days he describes his depression as unbearable. He takes a hormone supplement but other than that his depression seems essentially untreated.Having talked to him repeatedly about it over the past few weeks I have learned a lot about depression. I at first thought he felt this way because of a situation because of actions or inactions related to that situation because of dissatisfaction with the world around him. Now I better understand that while those things may be true what really has him struggling is that living so far has been very painful to him for a very long time and he does not want to try anymore to make it better. Basically if he cannot complete his goal he feels there is no further reason to brave the pain. He believes that pain is impossible to treat or live without. He says things that I see a lot in this subreddit.Once I began to understand what he was feeling a bit better I began specifically trying to convince him to get help with his depression. He seems open to the possibility e.g. he acknowledged that there may be hope even if he does not feel up to trying for it so I am trying to gather information. I am trying to learn more about what hes feeling which is why I came here. I am trying to find info about depression what that is like whether treating it is effective how much he may recover what is entailed whether those who have been through it or are undergoing it currently feel that its worth it and anything else just so that I can be informed and also to help give him enough hope to try to address the depression hes feeling and hopefully help him past the feeling that death is the only way he can feel relief.Which brings me to why I am here. After spending some time in this subreddit I realize that a lot of people who post here feel the same kinds of things he feels. In my desperation to help him I wanted to ask people who actually go through these things whether I am doing the right thing and for your perspective on depression treatment is it a good idea? If you are going through it or have been through it are you glad you did? Is it actually helpful for you? What would you say to my partner and how should I change the things I am saying? What do you think someone who is really trying to help a person feeling what he feel should say or do?Thanks so much for reading this. I hope I have not offended or upset anyone and wish you all the very best in getting through your own situations with depression or with helping someone who deals with it. How do I help? What would you say?,Depression
47861,How to deal with a severe burnout? Id like to keep this nice and short but if it ends up longer than I intend this to be please be patient with me. Also English is not my first language.Im a medical student also working a parttime job for hours for minimal wage. I have no time for hobbies and on top of everything my family is very unsupportive and Ive been battling with a chronic stomach illness for a year already with no definitive answers so far from my doctors. I still have a ton of examinations to undergo ranging from CTs scans to endoscopies and multiple blood marker tests and I have to pay all of them out of my pocket since my insurance doesnt cover them. Ive been working a lot to support myself and lately I caught myself crying a lot feeling hopeless and most of the time feeling completely numb disconnected from reality and in general feeling nothing. I feel like Im a complete fuckup.So my question would be how should I deal with being so burnt out and worn away from all this stress? I feel like I really want this pain to end but I cant seem to have just one calm hour to myself anytime soon. Please help. Any tip is really appreciated.,Depression

8853,Having one of those sleepless nights going down a rabbit hole of negative thoughts. Sometimes it is nice to be reminded that I am not the only one psychologically fucked up. So anyway what do some of you do to keep thoughts of self hatred at bay? At this point I hate pretty much everything about myself physically. I think my biggest problem is my level of perfectionism that I cannot shake. I know my negative qualities should not bother me as much as they do but I cannot help feeling the way that I do. How do you deal with self hatred?,Depression
21490,The pandemic has completely destroyed my will to live. I have lost interest in everything that I used to like and now actively hate a lot of them. I moved to a new city and have no friends. I have not seen anyone other than my parents in 16 months. I do not have any close friends who I can talk about my feelings to. I have a terrible relationship with my parents. They do not care that I am sad. I tried telling them about my feelings I cried to them. My mom brushed them off and my dad threatened to beat me up in front of all my classmates. I feel left out of everything. My friends are making plans hanging out playing games. I am here struggling through a mountain of workload and suffocating. Toiling through 10 hrs of online classes everyday trying to keep my sanity safe. Everyone I have talked to reacts negatively whenever i try to talk about my feelings. My closest friend accused me of using them after I confessed to them that I am suicidal. I have no motivation to do or learn anything. There is no interest for anything left in me anymore. Everyone tells me that I am to blame for my problems. No one knows what I am going through. No one cares. My friends tell me that I have become bitter. I hate myself so much. I just want to die somehow. I do not want to kill myself. I am too scared to. Thousands of people die everyday why cannot I be one of them? I feel so lonely. A lot of times I have dreams where I meet and hang out with people I love. I am so happy in them. Then I wake up and I am hit with reality that I will not ever be able to meet them again. I hate being alone.I do not think I have depression. I just wanted to post this somewhere because no fucking person is willing to listen and I am so sick of it. I hate it so much. I will get judged hard if I ever tell my feelings to anyone. it is ok if no one can help. I just wanted to speak out. I do not know what is happening. I just want to talk.,Depression

19070,I know this does not really fit here but it still kind of does because these are the pieces of S I have had to grow up with and deal with on a daily basis. They got tested for COVID and their results came back positive and they are still acting like it is not worth worrying about just because they are lucky enough their symptoms are not that bad.. they gave it to me too and I have been doing the best I can taking all of the precautions this whole time to avoid getting it.. I tried to tell them to stop going places without a mask because they have COVID stop going places at all but they insist they still have to live their lives and that its not that bad.. I honestly wish their COVID was a worst case scenario.. because they truly deserve it.. who knows what they are actively doing to other peoples lives.. I have struggled for a long time with how I feel about them because they are my family.. but they are just evil.. knowing you have the virus and still going and spreading it so you will not be slightly inconvenienced or worse to prove a point at this point they are just literally evil I feel awful that I cannot do anything to stop them from doing this no matter what they will not stop.. is this a crime? If it is I would like to report them honestly My POS parents keep going into stores without a mask on while knowing they have COVID,Depression

12302,need to have a Near Death Experience to snap me out of this depressive fog I have been in for nearly two years now. My life is without hardship and I have no reason to feel the way that I do and I believe that waking up in an ambulancehospital bed will shock me enough to wake me up from this. What is the best way to do this? I do not plan on dying as it would leave everything so so much worse for everyone else worse than anything else I could ever do. I have access to ADHD medication and fluoxetine. I am financially stable enough that a hospital visit will not put my family in financial danger. Should I OD on my medication write down the time and dose I take wait 15 or so minutes then tell my parents to call 911? Is there a better option?I know there are people that care about me. I know how to find suicide help lines. Please do not try to talk me out of this. I just need advice so I do not do something irreversible and make myself unsaveable. Planning an NDE. Need advice.,Depression
17141,Usually impermanence is a tool used to help people from feeling like pain and apathy are unavoidable or permanent. Usually it is supposed to convey that change for the better will eventually come while staying alive. But Impermanence is corrupted inside me. I go about every day like any other gear in the large machine that is modern capitalism. I spend my free time alone at home watching advertisements in my entertainment which reminds me I am never quite good enough. I get up in the morning commute to work listen to my boss in meetings pay 13 of my paycheck to the government so the military can set piles of money on fire in faraway countries flush half of the rest of my paycheck down the toilet paying for the privilege of shelter that is 10X as expensive as it was 40 years ago. I forego luxuries in order to put away a measly sum every year that will never grow large enough to support me in old age. I fall in line and do just like everyone else is doing. Because if it makes me feel absolutely obliterated and rotten inside clearly I must be faulty in some way compared to everyone else obediently and enthusiastically following the status quo. But all the while my mind reminds me of Impermanence. When I can hardly gather a modicum of resolve to get out of bed in the morning and into work when my heart cramps up and palpitates after a week of constant sedentary stress when I am spending my free time sitting in my car on the highway stuck behind hundreds or thousands of other cars listening to the radio tell me about our failure to tamp down on pollution on climate change on the pandemic on the homelessness crisis on wealth inequality on legislative corruption on gun violence on anything. My mind reminds me of Impermanence. My mind reminds me that all this shall pass not by staying alive longer and longer and waiting for the tooth fairy's salvation. All this shall pass because life shall pass. This will all be over one of these days. This is only for now...,Depression
26546,I had a car accident back on Halloween night 2020. I do not have much info other than the car went off road and rolled several times went airborne than landed on its wheels again after hitting a rocky wall. Was air lifted from scene to hospital in Indianapolis. Was kept sedated in Neuro ICU for 3 days while on life support left lung full of fluid right one developed pneumonia. Many broken ribs Sort term memory problems etc etc. Since the wreck I have had problems with smell and taste even showering makes me throw up andor gag body wash and soap smells like rotten meat and garbage. Most things I eat and smell are the same. I have suffered with severe pain from a herniated disc at the l4l5 vertebrae and have had foot drop the whole time. Seeing neuro surgeon this month and recently received a foot brace that helps me walk normally somewhat Confirmed by MRI 8 months after the accident. I received nothing for pain and most times my own family turns the other way when I am in pain because they do not want to hear my moans It bothers them. I went back to work 4 months after the wreck so that I could maybe be less of a burden my fiance had been going above and beyond in helping me but becoming more strained as time went on and less tolerant of my inability to do certain things Even work had changed... I was fired as a proto tech a month before covid went BOOM! I am in my mid 40's but I have always been strong independent and self reliant. I have always worked hard and for the previous 3 years took better care of myself. I quit smoking cigarettes quit drinking pop and eating healthier worked out on a very rigid and strict routine. But lately I find myself wondering why I keep fighting so hard. My life is mostly pain and misery that I have to keep to myself. I went from 180 pound to almost 300 by December finally back down to 215 june of this year I have grandkids that are wow..when I think about them..I think the are my only anchor. I do not know where to turn or what to say or to whom to say it too. I wish I could go back and not have the accident but I cannot...so how do I make others realize that? I feel so stupid writing this. I am submitting this anyway but I am apologizing in advance. Not actually sure what i am looking for or need but know I am not in a good place.,Depression

25807,I was doing better I swear.Then one small thing or a series of things and I am suddenly back where I am started. I am crying. Everyone seems to have freedom I barely have any friends to hang out with and everyone has moved on. Its like the pandemic is past them and I am still here. I feel like I would be worse off if I did not have my boyfriend. Hes my best friend. We have fun together we hang out. But... I miss my other friends. My family has been so cold to me. they have belittled me screamed at me shamed me. I do not remember them being like this before... I feel like I am losing my fucking mind. I go to therapy but I still feel like I am drowning. It seems like everyone has improved has made their free time useful. And I have not. I have just been rotting here in my mind. And I do not have the energy to leave my bed. I am trying and I do not know why its so hard...I cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel. Its all dark. Will it ever end?,Depression
10218,I have been struggling with depression and social anxiety for the past 10 years. For the past 3 years it has caused me to struggle with anhedonia more regularly and it has been getting worse lately. I am in my midtwenties and I already feel like I have missed out on so many experiences and opportunities in life especially those that are fun. A lot of people have said I am too serious and I need to learn how to loosen up and let go. Unfortunately I cannot seem to do that with alcohol or drugs. I am nervous that I might start increasing start relying on them to feel alive and have let loose. Recently I started going to therapy and I have been wanting to go out and try something fun but due to anhedonia it is difficult for me to find something that is fun for me to do. I was also a little sheltered growing up which does not help either. My parents were helicoptery and devout Christians so a lot of activities that others may consider okayfun is hard for me to enjoy or partake in without an immense amount of guilt and shame. I often find myself searching in Google what do people do for fun? to find out what other people who are not depressed find fun or fulfilling. Many of those activities do not resonate with me. What do you all think? What do people do for fun these days?,Depression

24529,Just wanted to share my experience here. I was not getting much better with SSRIS or bupropion. In the last three years I have tried different options but I never truly felt any major difference.I have changed analysts and my new one suggested trying lamotrigine. First time I have had more than two weeks of normality in years. I am only one month in and the difference is huge.I read many of the posts in this sub and recognize many thoughts as my own... And then realize I have not had them in a while. that is how I tell lamotrigine is really helping me.This is only one experience and it does not mean this drug would help everyone. But from one person who tried a lot of options to another one keep on trying. I did not believe I could be at peace and suddenly I am. Lamotrigine is really helping me,Depression

27216,Hey so I have posted a few places for support but no community has given me any so I am trying here.Backstory I have always struggles with depression and intrusive thought usually brought on by my father who is verbally abusive. He likes turning anything good to something negative. About me I am 20 this year and studying I moved out of parent's place and was doing so good until Covid decided to make us poor so I had to go back to my parents. I have been diagnosed with depression and bipolar and am pretty familiar with when to know a manic episode is coming but my depression just hits me low.All my colleagues always call me floaty because I am happy and chill by nature. I never fight and always ignore drama and conflict. Here I get to the pointMy family was recently attacked by a neighbor and my dad defended us by stabbing him so he went to jail for bail. In that time my mom and I were alone and living peacefully without problems or drama but my dad was suffering in jail and we kept on working to fairly get him out so he was the victim. I was really worried about my dad coming home because he is always been very negative and makes anything a problem. He came back a nice modest man who is grateful for everything. This however lasted only a week and once again everything in my home is cold and dark. We had a party and one of the guests accidentally packed his phone in when leaving. My dad went crazy accusing her of theft and screaming at us even though I got the phone back immediately. I had a panic attack due to all the screaming and anger.Today nobody in the house is talking everything is tense.I am just depressed and disappointed. I have been crying and nothing is happy anymore. The whole situation just completely through me of while I had been stable and happy till now.We have an apartment by the beach where I want to flee since I can still have online class from there and my workplace allows me to travel since we serve the whole country so I can go there and still work and study without any additional moving or trouble Problem is that our country has some limits on traveling between states right now however the apartment there is on my name and I could say I am going home.Should I stick it out at home or try to go? I know I cannot reject my father because his fragile yet his behavior is affecting my mental health. What would you do in this situation? External Factors harming recovery,Depression
47378,Is long term happiness possible When I really think about it Ive never really had any long period of happiness within my life. Ive tried so many things that I thought would make me happy. Ive tried therapy antidepressants and so many other things. I certainly dont have a bad life but still Ive never been happy for more than fleeting moments. The happiest Ive ever been is in a relationship I had but I just became reliant on her for my happiness which just caused it to fail and leave me worst than ever. It feels like I couldnt even find that again even if I tried. I just truly dont know what to do anymore. Am I just fucked up?,Depression

I cannot afford a check up or anything of sorts right now and I am not even sure if I want to know. it is been like this for a few years now where I just do not feel right... Feels a bit empty but when I say that out loud to myself I feel like I am just lying to myself or to others. Sorry for how all over the place this little rant thingy is.

16524,I feel empty and numbLike I know what I have to do for myself but I do not see a point. I am having so much trouble finding therapy that I can afford and that would work for me. Nothing is fun. I went to a party and basically slept through the whole thing. I feel bad because I keep venting to friends and they are great. And they say they do not mind. But too much is too much and I feel like I should really cut it off there.I am in a relationship with someone who unintentionally has hurt me greatly in the past and I am still trying to unlearn and forgive that. I am constantly uncertain. I cannot get out of bed and I cannot stand feeling guilt and weight on my shoulders for being uncertain for having a learning disability for taking my time for standing up for myself. I have very little fight left in me and being by myself makes matters feel worse I do not know,Depression
12074,Sorry for any mistakes I am not a native speaker and I am really sad right now.I am 18 years old and I am a man so you can get some context so I have been feeling really bad some years from now and i think i might have something and i would like to know what should i do so some months ago i found to be bisexual and before that i did not had any long time relation just a girl in the past but around 2 months ago i found a boy he was nice at first we liked to talk a lot about everything but more about politics ideas i already had told him about how I have been strange feeling about everything in general due to my ansiety.And today we had a fight about politics he offended me and as i really liked him I am really bad and for the first time I am really having suicidal thoughts i really need to know more about depression to be really sure if is that what i passing by and to be sure to seek for a therapist because i do not have much money for that because my country is kind of poor so i really wanted to be sure on what to do because I am really lost. I appreciate any help.Pswe have stop talking and we blocked eachother I need help i think i have depression and i do not really know what to do.,Depression
25154,I have been really digging deep into myself these past few months because I want to get better. I want to feel something other than inadequacy and pitifulness.Over the past few days I have come to the fact that I have an eating disorder and I have been living with it for probably a little over 2 years and it has gotten progressively worse with age. I have also been thinking about how I talk to others. I have realised that I am too nice and I let people walk all over me or I let mean comments pass by. I have decided I am not going to do that anymore and when someone says something that I do not agree with I am going to stand up for myself. I feel like a fraud. I feel like I am putting on thus facade to people to please people. Because I must admit it without being vain I am...different than most people. I dress weird I like old music I am wiser than my fellow sixteen year old peers and I am a lot more articulate than my peers and that is probably because I read the classics and enjoy poetry. I am an intellectual person and in my family I am a black sheep because everyone around me is a lot more shallow than I when speaking about topics and they just like different things than me. So when I am around other people it is better not to speak than to say something that does not fit their norm and be laughed at and made fun of. To be honest I would rather be alone than be in a group of people who share no interests than me. To me that is probably the worst thing to deal with...people you just do not click with. If I could have one person who was just my other half then I swear I would be happy for the rest of my life. That probably will not happen so I will not wish for it. I am a fraud.,Depression

16138,This lady was very nice at the start but by the end of her service yelled at my mom and got rude to me a few times. I was on 30mg of Lexapro for at least a few years went off it cold turkey due to her saying she needed to see me on webcam along with me giving up I had a breakdown she put me back on 10mg and I had to stop due to getting very strange symptoms.I first felt a dull pain in the top of my head then I had face numbness brain fog memory loss ear ringing jaw stiffness etc. I still have ear ringing brain fog and memory loss. The fog and memory loss seems worse now than a few months ago.I just do not know what to do. I do not know if this is the meds doing this or something else. I called her about 2 weeks ago and she would not give me any advice Saying that legally she cannot but when I ask if she would see me as a client again she will not only saying You should see somebody locally. Just so cold and uncaring. I do not know what I did wrong. I was never rude to her. I want my memories back and my quick acting brain back. I move so slow now and it is hard to think. Former SSRI prescriber might have overmedicated me and caused permanent damage refuses to give any advice to help me repair myself. I feel so used and abused.,Depression
23492,First post ever so uh bear with me?Well. Honestly title says it all. I have always had an off and on relationship with depression and I go to counseling but sometimes it gets harder to deal with. Usually its just random times here and there and I can push past it. This time its feeling harder. I am losing a lot of my motivation and want to even do things. I am tired so much of feeling like this. The last time I spiraled I got into a really bad place and I do not ever want to do that again but i just do not know how to keep pushing this all away? I feel like I am spiraling again.,Depression

22135,I just feel like if I had been taken for a psych evaluation when I was a kid Id be able to manage all of my mental illnesses better. I am a danger to others mostly but also myself. I almost feel resentment towards my parents because they saw how I was acting and the things I was doing to other people. It makes me feel bad because I know its not their fault we could not afford it and our insurance did not cover pediatric mental health. I just wish I had that chance to be a better person who could better handle their mental health. I feel like I could have had a chance to be better.,Depression

17514,I have to deal with chronic pain and sometimes I use drugs for pain relief. I am already sad I have chronic pain but after I get high and come down I feel flat emotionless and it is just an uncomfortable numbness. I have been valuing my sobriety lately the antidepressants seem to help with that. I can quit drugs but I would have to find other ways to cope with chronic pain. I have been taking the middle road and just smoking weed about twice a week drinking lots of coffee daily and finding other ways to cope with pain. Looking forward to getting high and alleviating pain and depression for a day gives me a goal and a reward but now it is increased the uncomfortable numbness. Now I am just drinking coffee to avoid caffeine withdrawals and it does not boost my mood like it used to. I just want a healthy relationship with drugs I need something better than abstinence or addiction and I just have not found it yet. Life seems to be telling me it is one or the other. Things can spiral when I live in a delicate equilibrium,Depression
19769,so I am 25 clinically depressed I take meds and I am broke going to start working at Amazon and still live with my mom. Went to a Bootcamp to become a data scientist. it is been a year since I have done anything related to the field probably sent like 20napplicaions in total. I feel like it is my depression that keeping me from enjoying things and makes me question do I even like this career? took me 5 years to get my associate's in electrical engineering. Then I switched my major again for the 4th time to data science and here I am questioning if I even want to do this. I am thinking maybe I just need to ignore my feelings of doubt laziness stress anxiety etc and just fucking do it. I will be miserable in the short term but maybe in a year or 2 I will finally move out be independent and maybe be happier? Idk does that sound like a good mindset to have to start moving forward? should I give up on shortterm happiness and invest in my longterm happiness?,Depression
14695,My provider no showed in telehealth.then when I text them they responded an hour later saying this was their final week and they do not work there as of this upcoming Friday.

20818,So I created a Tinder account. I am super shy so I put an anime girl and in the description I explained in great detail my personality and my physical appearance.This girl matched me like 1 week ago. 2 days ago I changed my description to only explain my personality. Today I decided to say hi. We chatted for some minutes. We had things in common like our introversion. I assumed she matched me in first place because she had read my original description.I gave her my Instagram and she stopped chatting.that is the kind of shit that gets you fucked up. Tinder,Depression
23634,I cannot lie in bed unless i pass out instantly which is around 6 or 7 am.

Why is going to bed literal torture,Depression

7953,I am so tired of this nostalgia crap everywhere. I do not want to be reminded of what I went through in 2005 or the extreme bullying I endured. Or my suicide attempt. I just want to move on and live in the current day with present day things. But no life has other plans.I cannot escape my past when it is suddenly everywhere again. I feel like it is fate. I do not have any reason to live anyway. My life has been a waste nothing to show for it. Just wish things would stay out of the past I do not to be reminded of. Sorry for the waste of time. Seeing things from the worst times in my life return makes me fall deeper into depression.,Depression
18672,I have never gone in to be diagnosed so I do not want to jump the gun on labels or anything but I have had quite the wild ride with depression throughout a good chunk of my life and I am at the point where I feel like I am truly standing on the edge. Not the edge of suicide... rather the edge of being able to put things off or make excuses.To give more context and a bit of a timeline even as a young kid I would have weird moments of clarity where I would just feel at a complete disconnect with peers as if I just did not have a place with them or if I was a useless part of the equation. When I was twelve was when I started having onandoff feelings of inadequacy and by thirteen I would have thoughts of suicide. I say thoughts in general because it was fantasizing scenarios more than anything. I did not take the thoughts seriously until around 1516. Once I was sixteen I would essentially start planning on actually killing myself however over the next few years I would constantly move the goalpost due to either feeling a string of hope or rather the goalpost may have just been there to give me an excuse to put things off and be lazy.. It was around 16 when feelings of disconnect and uselessness really settled in. Over the years it is obviously just been made worse and I have dug myself a deeper hole. Really I just cannot do anything and my brain as well as my body feel like mush most of the time. I hesitate to contact friends because I should not be the one bothering them. I hate myself for being a burden on my family and for getting involved with others because I just cannot add anything good to their lives and I do not get anything but shame in return either. I am 21 now and have never gotten 'help' for any of this. Before it was easier to deal with. If I was still in college taking my course or at least working my part time job at the time then it would not matter. I would not feel AS guilty because at least I was on what some may figure is a 'right track'. Now all I can feel is shame and guilt over just existing here and even the things I have managed to do to help myself over the last couple years have not exactly made me feel any better or improved the lives of those involved with me.that is not all because I am so stationary and lonesome all the time I can get really desperate when opportunities arise. Things come and go so easily but I tend to get attached just as easy. If people come into my life and make me feel good for a bit before leaving that just leaves me worse off than before and I feel like I am struggling to even hit mediocrity. I do not blame peoplethings for not working out with me because I know all I can really offer is a netnegative experience but I cannot help myself from being blinded with a brief sense of hope every time.As the title suggests I do not know where to go from here. The last point I have made happened again recently and now I am in a spot where it is just been hard to get things done because I am in a state of not only 'what is the point?' but also 'I just do not care anymore'. I do not even have any more 'goalposts' to give me any excuses to just live comfortably for a bit. The last one was going to be a couple days after Christmas of 2020 but again nothing happened.I am now at a point where I am willing to try meds. Just between the usual constant feelings of guilt and worthlessness and feeling incapable of things some new events that have unfolded recently I do not think it is worth it not to try if I can make myself better. I was recently prescribed other meds already and I actually found out that my Province covers this stuff until I reach 24 years old which is good news. To be quite honest I am just scared because I do not want anyone I am close to to know about this. I know that the obvious response will just be to worry about me and I really do not want that. Not really sure how to proceed from here,Depression
40169,it can take me almost a week to clean something simple or put away a small pile of laundry i didn t even eat today by anxiety wa too high and when i brought it down the depression wa unbearable all i can think about is how i never asked to be in this life to be born especially in today society i have trouble connecting with people and my social anxiety is so bad all the therapist i ve seen never really cared and acted like i wa being over dramatic the pill made everything worse and now i m apparently treatment resistant i can t even finish my resume because i m terrified of being around people again yet i can t find anyone who care enough to help my friend don t understand and they ve given up on me i just want a simple stay at home job with very little human interaction my friend said that s impossible which made me even more suicidal i hate the phrase it s a permanent fix to a temporary situation this isn t temporary i ve been dealing with depression and anxiety for basically year now yes i ve tried to get help but nothing ha worked i just keep getting worse i don t want to wake up i m too afraid of messing up an attempt that i haven t gone through with it i m just stuck in this hellish existence and i just want it to end i have no purpose no meaning please i just want it to end,Depression

25448,About a year ago I got new neighbors and they are everything I am not and its really done a number on my depression. I am not childless and happy. I am not compatible with my girlfriend at all. there is no sex and when there is its devoid of sexual attraction. I have spent the last 6 years being the most bored lonely and sexually frustrated I have ever been. My house is a mess and I have officially lost all my hair and all my friends moved away. Meanwhile my neighbors are both extremely attractive. They are constantly working on their yard and enjoying a life of freedom and happiness that I am not allowed to have. They are compatible and look like they have a blast together. Last few weeks they have been building a garden and having nice dinners in a beautiful patio. And today I drove by and noticed they have been building an amazing outdoor movie theater. And that was the straw that broke the camels back. I have not been able to sleep and think about suicide a lot and its all because I keep comparing my life to theirs and see what could have been. Its like they know everything I cannot be in life and they are flaunting it in front of me. I do not want to live another 6 years of a life I am not compatible with. I wish I could be free and make decisions that would make me happy without making life worse. I know these problems are nothing compared to others but how does everyone else here deal with jealousy when it keeps you up at night? How do you people deal with comparing yourself to others?,Depression
18649,I went over to one of my friend's house for the first time. She has a beautiful house but it is probably just an average house in the US.

47193,The worst symptom of depression for me is low self esteem. Because its so obvious. Lets face it no one likes someone who isnt comfortable in their own skin its why people gravitate towards social enthusiastic people who love themselves these types of people are managers well respected individuals with families.Im bright capable yet Im completely and utterly held back for the simple fact I hate myself.

26757,I have struggled with mental illness my whole life. From the early age of 6 I was diagnosed with anxiety and OCD. Later on at about 10 I was diagnosed with ADHD and than a few years later diagnosed with depression. My first depressive episode took place when I was on middle school and after seeing a therapist weekly and going on meds I soon became happy and content with my life. However a few years later now I F17 decided to try and go off my meds. Talking to my parents doctor and therapist we decided to give it a try. And for the first month or so I was completely fine. Nothing was wrong and I felt good. But I soon after had fell into a depressive episode. My trigger was and had been the time before an internal feeling that I was not good enough. This time the trigger had been not getting a part I wanted in a show I was acting in pushing all these intrusive thoughts into my head. The main one that I have struggled with however is the thought of suicide. I do not know why. I do not want to die I do not want everything to end but I cannot shake the thought. And over the next few months it just got worse. I ended up getting into a relationship with a guy from school and we have been dating for almost 3 months. Over this time though I have developed ROCD to the point where I think of my bf and I immediately feel miserable. I feel so bad because he likes me so much and I cannot stop with all the ROCD intrusive thoughts. It got to the point where I would nervous vomit every time I knew I was going to see him. I have no idea what to do. I have ruined multiple eventsvacationsparties for myself by just ruminating on the ROCD thoughts of whether I actually like him or not or if were supposed to be together. I have just fucked up the past few months of my life and relationship. Since then I have gone back on my meds and am seeing my therapist more frequently. Me and my bf are currently on a break but we are meeting up to decide on what to do in 3 days. I have genuinely been better when I have been able to focus on myself but I really do not want to break up with him however hard the relationship might be. I have major guilt from the depression and ROCD thoughts and I do not know what the next step to take is. I have been having these thoughts since we first started dating so how do I know this is just ROCD or are me not meant to be together? My depression has ruined my relationship with my bf and myself,Depression
7034,I finally got my depression well under control at the end of this last year. I was managing an exercise routine cooking lots of healthy and fun meals instead if junk food spending more quality time with my family enjoying hobbies again thriving in school and managing a self care and hygiene routine which was always one of my big struggles.I felt like I finally got things under control but I made a big mistake that is sent everything crashing down. I took on extra responsibility and I put too much on my plate. I would rather not elaborate on what it was but now I feel like I have no time for myself so all of my routine went out the window. I had to do a late withdraw from my last 2 college courses when I had maintained a 3.9 prior. I do not shower or brush my teeth for days at a time I find myself binge eating and falling back into restrictive eating disorder habits I only really look forward to eating and getting in bed every night. The Fall semester is set to begin and I do not even think I will be able to do it. If I am lucky I might slide by and pass but I am going to suffer even more with that on my plate too. Why the fuck cannot I be a functioning person? Sometimes I want to move away from my family and just let myself self destruct to my hearts content. I feel like I live to eat and sleep again,Depression

7886,Instead of these swirling ferocious emotions nibbling at my heart and mind.Its these slight pains and aches in my chest thinking about the world and who I am.My confused emotions are still there but now they are getting fainter and dimmer. But still just as cruel.I am coming to the realization that I am a nobody with nothing special to give no talent no skill nothing monumental.I am just a dipshit with a pencil that looks like a child infront of professionals and aspiring artists.Watching my classmates go on with their lives in college living life to the fullest being happy with family. While I am sitting here waiting for this extra upcoming semester to actually graduate... like a fool.My social skills are nonexistent no wonder I have been dumped by people and shoved to the side by previous friends. No wonder I push people away as I regress into the deep crevices of my cracking mind.Do I exist just to torment myself and have those around me use me as a doormat.Why do I even exist? Why am I still alive.I am just waiting for when I am all alone in a shotty apartment with a shitty job. Idk how ill do it but it will happen. I will be disconnected from everyone nobody will know I had done it until my landlord checks up on me and sees me.I just have to wait... wait until I am out of here..It makes me hopeful my only point in this life is to kick the bucket early on.Took me this long to genuinely realize it.I wonder who will be the next me...Me as in the person I wanted to become a great artist a humble and gentle person a soft and timid heart a kind and sweet smile...Well I guess that is not actually me..I do not need help anymore I feel contempt..So why am I posting here.. Thought I would never be back,Depression
20068,I have been labelled as depressed but sometimes it feels like a bit of a blanket term because I see how many people go in for treatment of depressionanxiety and later find they actually have a personality disorder. I am not a person who does not believe in depression but I am highly suspicious despite all the people who have told me I am depressed. How did you know you were depressed instead of having a personality disorder?,Depression
11055,I feel so alone in my life.It hurts me and breaks me down everyday. I feel like I have nothing to live for. I have no one. I am alone.I will never be loved or accepted by people. My mistakes will haunt me for the rest of my life. I hope people can see me for who I am and not my mistakes. I feel so numb and weak. I just want to call it quits. I cannot take it any more.,Depression
15674,I feel like I have tried every medication over the years. I was on Zoloft for a literal decade and have only just weaned off it and went onto Wellbutrin. I am also on Lamictal to stabilize my moods. However the Wellbutrin while it gives me energy is making me extremely short tempered and aggravated. I am going to talk to my psychiatrist in a couple days about adjusting my meds and might ask about a low dose of Zoloft along with the Wellbutrin but I just really do not want to be on three different mood meds at the same time. Has anyone been in this situation suggestions? Medication questions,Depression
27261,I have been trying for so long. Told my family about my depression and they act like they care then forget the next day. I finally managed to ask for professional help from a doctor and my school. I am 15 my parents are divorced. I live with my mum and my dad lives some 2000 kilometres away. I moved 2 times in the past year and due to that I lost my friends so I do not have anyone to rely on and I am a year 9 so I friend groups and so on have been already made and I cannot really befriend anyone at this point. I have been struggling the past 3 weeks with anxiety and depression and not wanting to wake up in the morning for school. And to add to injury my mum is now saying I am going to go back to my dads and will have to start working and drop my education which I do not want to do and I do not want to make issues for my dad either as he is a driver so he drives 800km per day so he is rarely at home and barely gets sleep. I just do not know what to do at this point talking about will not help since they will just act like nothing happened and my dad cannot support me as he is over 2k km away and he is not the best dad either but still cares enough to see that I am hurting and need help but cannot do much.I do not know why I am writing this and in such a weird way I left out so many details but I do not want to make it too long.TLDR I am depressed seeked help person who cares cannot do much broken inside and want to end it all. What to do next?,Depression
19173,I struggle with depression like the rest of you and I know many of us relate to one another. Its a beautiful thing to be able to reach out and know you are not alone ever I really mean it. I cannot stress enough how grateful I am for this community even. But so often when I mention I am struggling with life other people want to help by telling me they can relate they deal with similar things etc. I am tired of it. And what I mean by that is I feel like it takes away from my pain a little when they are like oh yeah I understand I am also going through blah blah blah. I am really struggling to describe the feeling. Perhaps invalidated? Dismissed?I know they are just trying to help. And again I cannot stress enough how grateful I am for my support system and this community. But to ME anyway it comes across like they are saying everyone has problems and struggles with something at some point. Which is true. God I feel like an awful person because they just want to help me. I feel so selfish and ungrateful. I think for me personally it would help me more to hear something along the lines of gee that fuckin sucks I appreciate you for hanging in there and not jumping off a bridge or even I am so sorry you are having a rough time. Needless to say if you can relate at all please share! This is more applicable to my experiences in real life so I am curious if you guys feel similarly. And I am sorry for being so selfish. I am selfish,Depression
23052,I am 26. I keep wondering what those 26 years of life are worth. Today I have decided not to do anything I had planned just because I do not think they will help me in the long run. Today I have been very contemplative. Lying here there are a lot of ways I could end my own life some of which involve me not being discovered for hours. But it is not just my life I would be upending. My mom 50s is already unemployed practically schizophrenic. cannot imagine what it would be like to pay to bury me. My sister 23 is applying to medical school. This would just derail her entirely. And my boyfriend 26 he would feel heartbroken and guilty. I do not even think he would be able to come out of his room let alone trust himself to date anyone for a few years. I know they love me too. I am glad they love me so I will stay for them. The emotional and financial toll of my death on my immediate family is the only thing keeping me here.,Depression
20917,9 years of supposed happiness but oh I have changed and realized that you are not what i want! Its me not you! Now leave me alone forever and do not ever talk to me again! No i do not hate you i just want you to stop existing! Being consciously ghosted into oblivion by someone you loved is the worst fucking pain,Depression
7903,I am struggling to get past a traumatic event that was due to someone else's actions that made me disabled.I believe this is the sole because of my depression. I cannot get past it and I keep thinking about what life would have been like if it did not happen. I want to stop thinking about it but every morning I wake up that is all I can think about.Hope you are all having a good day.Take care How do you get over a really bad event that happened to you?,Depression
24012, Sorry if this whole post is a mess my mind is a huge mess atm Anybody out there who grew up without proper adult supervision or is currently doing so? Man if you are I have deep respect for you and you deserve nothing but the best in life. I live this way too and it is the worst. I am currently 15 years old and I have been living without proper adult supervision for nearly 3 years. People might think living with no house rules no discipline no anything might be the best but it is nothing like that for me. Basically I live with a lazy cousin who does almost nothing else but play games and shit even though he is 22. And my guardians who are supposed to be taking care of me are miles away from the house I live in. For the past couple of years I have been raising my own self aside from financial support which I am thankful for but it is not enough pretty much trying to figure everything out all alone. Before this all happened to me I had a pretty normal life wherein I was kind of dependent on my parents on everything. But I mean c'mon parents are there to give children what they need time love and their basic needs you know. So moving onto this kind of lifestyle after I lost my parents was really tough. I had to deal with mourning their loss moving into a new city school home changing my lifestyle completely and leaving my friends my old house all behind altogether. And I was pretty much alone throughout all of it because nobody my age could understand how I felt and my guardians who are supposed to be looking out for me kind of always just leave me alone. Sure it might not be the hardest thing ever for some people but it really has been for me. Fast forward to nearly 3 years of living this kind of life it is only gotten worse. The house I live in is always under heavy neglect because of my failure to keep up with all the chores and my cousin literally not helping but just adding to the mess. The dishes always pile up we seldomly take out the trash so that piles up too there are so many containers in the fridge with unfinished food that has been there for several months the back area is infested with insects and snails parts of our rooves are leaking our gardens are ridiculously overgrown and were always late on restocking groceries etc. I could keep going on and it just gets worse and worse. To add to that we do not eat healthy foods and only eat 12 times a day we just eat processed foods or fast foods plus we do not get any exercise either. Our lives are disgusting and I really wish I had the strength to persevere and change our lives but.... it is been so tough being in all of this alone. I always try to initiate changing our lives but every time I do so hoping I would motivate my cousin to help me he does not help me. He still stays lazy while I try and fix our lives and it really takes a huge toll on me and always affects my progress because I just wish he would help. Lately I have been dealing with so much more to the point I have nearly attempted to leave the world for good several times. I thought I just rather be with my mom now. This is because my aunt who lives halfway across the world decided that I was going to get two puppies. do not get me wrong I love dogs so much but they are not suitable for the kind of lifestyle I have right now. And now I feel so overwhelmed with how untidy and messy our house is but the dogs are already here. I feel so bad for them I feel like they deserve a much better home. And it is also been a struggle to take care of them personally. Because I feel like I am failing them and not providing everything they need. they are both big breed dogs which I have never had so everything with them is a new experience for me. I feel like I am not giving them the proper lifestyle they need so it is been so stressful. Plus again as expected my cousin is not helping. He does not even at least pet them or play with them you know? And it hurts me so much. I live in a middle to upperclass town but my life is pretty close to how people in poverty live or even worse because at least some of them still manage to have fun and have loving families. This place is the most depressing place I have ever seen and lately I have just realized how emotionally neglected I am. it is been nearly 3 years since my mom passed away but I have not even gotten close to moving on. The thought of her being gone has been and still is so heartbreaking and always brings me to tears. And nobody in my family has bothered to sit down with me and ask me how I am doing or how I am coping. it is just been so dead in the house I live in especially for the past year and a half in quarantine. My cousin and I barely talk unless we go outside to run errands. He just stays in his room all day and does not bother helping out with the house. I swear to god I have contemplated just going away for good so many times. This fucking life is horrible and I want to escape so badly and be with my mom in heaven. The only thing that is stopping me now are my dogs I love them too much now to leave them behind knowing that they might not be taken care of properly. So I really am trying my best to muster up the strength to fix my life without the feeling of needing my cousin to be as productive as me. But I just find it so hard depression just does that to you I guess. I just wish things get better and I wish I continue to fight for myself and my dogs. Ps. I am not really looking for pity we all have our own tough challenges in our lives and this is my battle to fight. I would absolutely appreciate it though if those with the same experiences comment down below and let me know how you managed to get out of it and get better. Or at least what you do to cope. I am 15 and I have been realizing how emotionally neglected I'am by my family.,Depression

15985,How far grom truth is statement that depression is half caused by biological problem and half caused by psychological problem.

20608,Our friendship has definitely concluded last I heard about them they refused to talk to me because I betrayed their trust. I do not want to post details but to make a long story short a woman I fell out with spent some time with them after we fell out and their silence started thereAfter being friends for almost 10 years I do not think its too ridiculous to at least get an explanation but I know deep down his strings are getting pulled by other people. I am mad they allowed this to happen and constantly want revenge but I would also just gladly forget about them if I knew how. Any advice for someone who lost their closest friend and is not sure if they want to hurt them or forget them.,Depression
11432,36m. Basically dealt with depression since I was around 12. Until 5 years ago I would never told anyone. I finally told my wife after being together for 10 years and I have been on various antidepressants since. Currently on Cymbalta. Occasionally I will miss a day on my meds and I feel my mood drop noticeably the next day or two until I level back out.Last weekend my wife and I got into a small argument we honestly never fight. In the end I feel like I hurt her without meaning to so I decided I wanted to feel as bad as I made her feel.I have not taken my meds and the depression is real. But in a fucked up way I think I like it. In an ironic way engaging in some self destruction makes me feel a bit more alive.Has anybody experienced this? Stopped my meds.,Depression

17752,Because of a crappy childhood I was always kind of a sad kid. Always mildly depressed so when the big depression hit when I was around 20 it did not feel anything too out of the ordinary. But I got through it. Went to therapy got fit started to like myself dated often the whole shebang. I had conquered 20 years of depression and was on top of the world. But about 2 years ago a traumatic event happened with the closest friend group and now I am back here. Feelings of worthlessness anxiety the whole package deal. It sucks so much worse now because I had a taste of what happiness really was like. I feel like after going through my first round of therapy I should have all the tools and knowledge to beat this depressive fog...But it is been 2 years and nothing. Thanks all for reading my rant. The second round of depression sucks.,Depression

24090,Why is selfishness and greed so rampant in society? Why is everyone a megalomaniac? Why does everyone want attention? Why do most people do more harm than good? Why is humanity not there in us humans? Why does everyone think the other person is always wanting something from them? Why does discrimination exist? Be it based on colour religion economic status social status anything. Why do people like to abuse someone verbally or in any other form just because they can? Why can we not get rid of this? I do not know. Maybe there is something wrong with me. Why is this world full of shitty people?,Depression
12315,I can be relatively happy and just kind of getting better. One bad thing happens it can be relatively minuscule and I am cutting and writing my suicide note. I cannot handle the mood swings because I barley survive them. I am on medication for depression and ocd but it does not seem to help. Its a high of happiness and then an insane sadness and depression in an instant. Does anyone else deal with this. It makes my life unlivable the people around me do not know. I do not feel like explaining. I have been called dramatic before but I legitimately attempt suicide every time. I do not tell anyone and I am miserable being alive. Has anyone been put on a medication that can help this?. Need recommendations. Want to try everything because when I am not in the insane lows I am still sad but not suicidal like I am when I hit these insane periods. Insane mood swings,Depression

23549,My suicide attempt was from my mom threatening to kick me out and I was scared of being homeless. She insists alcohol is my problem and the psych ward is forcing me to take anti alcohol abuse meds I do not want to take. Now I am looking for my own place. I am way happier and it looks like I have a place lined up for August 15th. I want to drink so fuckin bad though and I might be in here for a whole month more... I am just so pissed off because the doctor has me on this medication that essentially stops your body from being able to breakdown alcohol so if I drink it it will make me very sick. I do NOT want to be on this medication. Instead I want to be on Naltrexone which should stop you from abusing alcohol but I can still enjoy it. The meds they have me on seem like poison. My psychiatrist is trusting what my mom is saying but she has extremely skewed and strong opinions from her own past with drinking so she INSISTS that is what my problem is even though I have never missed a day of work from it and I really enjoy it. What caused me to be here is I literally had two vodka seltzers and she FREAKED THE FUCK OUT so I decided to try try kill myself because I was done. UGH I WANT OUT OF HEREEEEE I have BEEN HERE FOR 3 WEEKS. I need to vent. I am currently in a psych ward for a suicide attempt.,Depression
14892,I stopped drawing and reading regularly a few years ago. Two of my absolute favorite things to do since childhood. I am well into college now so the only reason I might draw is to finish an art project I procrastinate an ungodly amount of time on projects anyway I keep hoping my drive for it will come back but every time I try I lose interest very quickly or get frustrated. I keep getting sucked back into these ruts where Ill feel numb and unmotivated and kind of hopeless for days. So Ill spend most of my time sleeping or doing nothing in my room. As an athlete I do workout regularly but it never completely curbs these feelings away. But if I have a decent week I think there cannot be anything wrong with me. Only for the cycle to continue. I just do not know what to do anymore. I hate feeling so miserable on and off. I am scared of the future because I cannot seem to do anything right for myself. I wish I could enjoy drawing and creating like I used to but I cannot imagine I ever will again. do not know if my passion will ever come back,Depression
27176,i was not even supposed to live this long. i honestly cannot imagine a future for myself and i cannot imagine myself getting any older. i do not feel ready for the future or responsibilities. I have been depressed for a while and always thought i would die at 14 at most. well surprise i passed that age a while ago and now o do not know what to fucking do. i never bothered to actually figure out a future for myself and i have not had dreams or things i genuinely wanted in a long time. idk what its like to work for something and i cannot imagine myself actuslly being a functional human being. my next birthday is approaching and i do not want to hit it. i was actually doing better before going to therapy taking meds trying to love myself and set goals and o thought things were finally looking up but then something broke and i gave in to the thoughts all over again. i do not know what to do but i feel like a future with me in it should not exist. it feels wrong for something like that to be real. i feel like this year is my expiration date,Depression

27217,I woke up today and it just hit me. The depression is back.So much for actually being excited about life and having a ton of self confidence. So much for having enough energy to be exercise and stay up late.Now I do not have enough energy to do anything amp my memory and reasoning skills have instantly declined. Brain fog is real and it slows me down especially since I seem to only be able to focus on my failures when I am depressed.I was productive for about two months and secured a job. I have not started but I am already questioning if I am going to be able to handle it.Can someone just shoot me? The crash,Depression
26646,So i was typing this message to my exshe recently broke up with me but decided against it as I do not want her to feel bad.Little backgroundHad depression my whole lifeFirst tried killing myself at 5 or 6 but have not tried to in many yearsIntermittently had good days weeks months and years between the badas most dodo not know if I am so used to the pain that i do not know what real happiness is or Id rather be dark because its what i know. It feels weird typing this.I cried for the first time in so many years. My depression is crushing me so much of the time even though you would never know. I do not think i could look in the mirror and say one thing i like about myself most of the time i feel like i should punch myself. I see a picture of myself and. Its almost repulsive. I was born being choked by my own umbilical cord. Probably should have died then.You suggested therapy but there is no way I am going and it will not help how do you help someone just born feeling this way? The only thing they do is give you drugs to mask the pain and i took those for years and was a literal zombie. I never feel really right around people and I have never seen myself really having an actual friend. Left out some other stuff about how i am glad she left me so she can be happy yada yada but that is the main part Recent very dark days,Depression
13231,I do not even know how to respond. They could not even give me a reason why although deep down I know the reason and it is not something I have control over. I am so embarrassed... I was not even good enough for a fucking minimum wage job. And now I am going to have to take anti anxiety meds so that I can somehow manage to go interview somewhere else and ridicule myself even more. I hate this. This job was one of the few things in my life I felt like I could control one of the only things that gave me false hope that I was going to turn my life around. I even made friends. Now I am back to square one. kind of wish I could just disappear. I lost my job today,Depression

47952,not sure about what to do with my life. For the past 4 years I've 18m struggled with depression I guess it started with the very turbulent divorce of my parents a violent fuckfest when I was 14yo in 2019 it was at that time that I started doing drugs such as mdma lsd and cocaine however I'd say my drug consumption really started as young as 12 given that I would abuse my adhd medication ritalin by snorting it.Later down that year I had some pretty shitty moments with my mother physical violence as my father abandoned us to go live in another country for half the year when he came back they found out about my drug usage which again ended up in physical abuse and the over infantilization of a 15 yo boy who never had any freedom or power in his life my parents started walking me to school it was 2 blocks away from home lmao once they even punched me infront of my classmates and threatened some random boy about beating him up because they confused him with someone I smoked weed with.At the end of that year they sent me to love with my grandma in another country.There I was all alone in a country that was foreign to me although I was born there I had family of course but I can't really be myself around my family the year was 2020 and I was just starting classes again when the pandemic hit it was at that point when I abandoned my studies for the first time tbh I didn't suffer through covid because I lived with my cousin and we played videogames all day but I ended up drinking a ton of alcohol in secret again sniffing gas from the stove stealing pills from my grandma because I was desperate life felt like it physically weighted on meI stopped eating because sadness did not allow me to I started getting weaker and weaker untill 10onths later my mother picked me up and we returned to tje country I was raised in.It did not get better for a long time.My mother did not trust me at all and didn't allow me to go outside I was 16 at the time she even hid the keys from me.As I realized that she would never trust me again I said fuck it and started smoking weed again yadda yadda I start studying again and pass the year yay but still I was a 17yo boy who isolated himself for 2 years and didn't talk irl to anyone that wasn't family I developed a serious internet addiction due to it.In 2022 stuff got slightly better but not really during summer break I met a girl 26yo online and we start talking we like each other the first time I left my house in years for something that wasn't school was to meet her which I did at the cemetery I was 17.Later in that year I get into an altercation with my mother and she beats me again and kicked me out of her house after that I live with my father for a couple weeks before she decided to ask me to come back home again she never said sorry I get even more depressive to the point I abandon my studies again.Then I become 18 years old and this 26yo girl I talked about before asks to unvirgin me to which I said yes she invited me to her brother's bday party.When everyone went to sleep we were in bed together I was sleepy and high and she was drunk and coked tf up we had a very awkward kiss I then say that I forgot to bring condoms and she mounts me anyway before I could say anything.After that shitty experience we become a couple my first girlfriend ever yay.Fuck it was a rollercoaster of shit she was abusive she offered me coke after I was clean for 3 years she insulted me and said I was only useful for sex she even slapped me a couple of times.Why does everyone abuses me?Now 2023 I have my first job but I still struggle with my weight which makes me very self aware of how weak and small I am.. I feel ugly I feel emasculated.Now I have to study again and I just can't keep up with study and work my work shift goes from 4am to 12pm and my classes go from 6pm to 12amI just want to give up I feel like I don't deserve anything I just want to sleep and sleep and wake up when everything's allright.Sorry I don't know why I wrote this sorry for the english.,Depression

24435,Hey everyone this may not be the right place to do this but I need some help or advice or something. My significant other suffers from depression and it seems to be getting pretty severe to the point where I do not know what to do to help him. As for how he deals with it he does not believe in going to counseling or taking medication and he will slip into these angry empty combative episodes where he just wants to be left alone or he tries to fight and argue with the people closest to him at the time. He used to be really mean and destructive but I would say that part has gotten a smidge better. But everyday he gets mad and combative when I go to work or very shortly after I leave our apartment. He will tell me he does not want to text or we will fight before I leave for work. I do not know what to do anymore because I thought the best route as per his wishes was to just stay out of his way and let him figure it out but now its taking a toll on me with the same thing every time I have to go to work or while I am at work. Should I just keep letting him be or try to talk to him about it? This has been going on and off for months now mostly on. I feel guilty for going to work now and try to take as much time off so we can avoid the episodic behavior but I am running out of PTO and I am the only one working right now to pay our bills. Please. If anyone takes the time to read this please help me. I love him very much and do not want him to suffer when maybe I can help him. so is for my SO,Depression
27018,My dad passed away in January of 2012 and eversince then my life's been going down hill. He elft me a very hefty inheritance but they say not even money can save you from the sadness. I am never truly happy. I fail at relationships. Whenever I get happy something bad happens. My mood swings are very bad. At one moment I am happy and the next I am feeling sorry for myself thinking of suicide. I do not want to kill myself but at the same time I do not want to be alive. Life is a gift. But I cannot live it like this. I hope that one day I can be able to overcome and beat my depression. I hope I can be able to live a happy life.

7043,I do not know what happened. Over the course of one night I went from optimistic to questioning my reality. I am a 27M and it seemed like I got under eye wrinkles within a night. I do not know if I did not realise it before but I certainly did the morning after and the revelation hit me like a bus. I look old. Older than a 27 year old. I am single I have no career no degree no money and have nothing going on in my life. But the odd thing was before that night I was still hopeful about things turning around in my life. But as soon as I saw my wrinkles that hope just seemed to vanish into the creases under my eyes. I realised I was no longer young and the thought of getting old alone is scary. Finding a partner was hard enough but this will only make it harder. The thought of aging is depressing me.,Depression

I have a ton of student loan debt because I had no idea what I was doing and neither did my parents and now I have been in a huge mess for the past 8 years and I cannot take it anymore. I feel so invisible. No one talks about debt. My parents do not want to help. I have worked so hard to pay the bills and keep my head above water and feel like I have nothing to show for it because throwing the money at a useless degree that I did not even need. I get so jealous when I hear peoples parents paid for their college or help them. Why am I not deserving of my parents help? Why cannot I be like those lucky people who had smart parents who were looking out for them? Even if my parents could not afford 1 towards my education I wish they guided me and told me the school I chose would be a huge mistake. Every day I wish I could go back in time and do it all over. I regret so much Constantly wanting to die because of money,Depression

13815,Hi everyone I am prone to depression hey that is the name of the subreddit but when I am not in a depressive episode I am a huge overachiever. I am 24F and work in a creative highpowered job with a lot of older mostly male people.Back when I was in college I would just power through depressive episodes by focusing on graduating. I developed a lot of tricks to force myself to endure temporary pain to maximize my grades. This was not a particularly sustainable solution but it did work and I graduated with honors. I recently joined a new team at work and it is very demanding of me in ways I am not used to there is a lot of politics that I am struggling with and very openended projects. Still I managed to find a way to be productive. For the first few months I was basically a model employee working tons of extra hours to deliver great work. But something snapped about a month ago and I have been in a real funk and it is been getting worse. I just feel like nothing matters like I am bad at everything like I cannot deliver like I am letting everyone down like I am broken. I probably have not gotten in a good day of work in almost 3 weeks. This used to happen to me in college but my usual forcing functions strict due date must get good grades must graduate do not apply anymore. My boss has not noticed anything because I am pretty autonomous usually but I would imagine that I will have to talk to him soon.I have an appointment set up with a therapist soon have not been to therapy in around a year but I am getting really concerned about how this episode is going to affect me longer term. When I am feeling good I get myself into these overachiever scenarios where depressed me cannot possibly measure up then when I get sluggish I feel so inadequate that I just beat myself up the whole time. it is gotten to the point where I am considering talking to a psychiatrist and taking disability leave rather than work another day where I just stare blankly at my computer and stress out.Can anyone relate? Advice? Making it through a depressive episode as an overachiever with a demanding job?,Depression
47350,I get sad in spring I hate this time of year. It means I have a ton of yardwork to do until the end of summer. I hate doing my taxes. I hate the time change to daylight savings time. I hate that the air is going to be so much more humid and my hair is going to fuzz out to twice its size. I hate wearing warm weather clothing. I would much rather coverup and feel cozy. I get seriously angry and sad. Traumatic events from my past usually happen in the spring. Most people love spring and summer. I hate being this way. Im tired of the screwed up world.,Depression

11207,Summary I felt great but then I called the cops on my friend for sexual assault some nsfw which they took extremely seriously and I do not want to go to court. Then my cat died and I am in pain. I think my friend filmed my family in the toilet there is lots of evidence to suggest he did. My mum told me not to call the police but I am stubborn and ignored her I thought I was doing the right thing that maybe him being on record would help future victims and that if he has any content uploaded they could find it. The police interviewed me and I told them how he used to send me porn and how I think it might be connected due to the genre. At that the police seemed concerned and went outside to contact the sergeant. They said him sending me porn was another offence they would need to investigate. I panicked and insisted it was not a big deal that I was not bothered it was just a joke I just thought there may be some connection. They said they need to contact the CID and that this is really serious. I am so scared I cannot go to court I have serious anxiety and depressive problems. All I wanted was for them to tell him off basically and put him on record not this. This has gone way too far. Before the police left the constable told me I was doing the right thing and that I was brave. I do not think I am though my friend could go to prison because of me! I hate myself so much right now. Later on my mum was driving me home and she told me my cat died. She was hit by a car which killed her instantly. I sobbed the whole way home. My mum kept her in the freezer and I needed to see because I was having a hard time believing it. She was cold and curled up like she was asleep. I sat there stroking her fur and crying. I feel like its my fault. We moved to the city near a busy road and since she kept escaping we decided to let her go outside. I was told I could send her to live with my father but I said no because he was abusive and mistreated her so I thought she would be safer with my mum. I moved away recently and could have brought her over but did not. I said the roads might be busy but I was far away from the road. And now she is dead. Its all my fault. I loved her and I am never going to see her again. And you know what is weird I actually felt really happy a few days ago like really happy and confident I was energetic and laughing and dancing about. Turns out that was the day my cat died which I did not know about. The next day is when I called the police because I felt so confident like nothing was going to go wrong. Its like I am not supposed to be happy like every time I think I am on top of everything a string of things go wrong somehow. I thought about killing myself just to end it all so I do not have to deal with more loss or with going to court. I want to live and I want to be happy but I am so scared and do not think I can do it I really need help right now because everything is going wrong,Depression

I have been on a merry go round of meds and nothings working. its like my fucking brain is rejecting themim sick of being told it gets better when it has not gotten better its only gotten WORSEi do not know what to do anymore. I am not enjoying anything my mental stability is deteriorating and i feel beyond helpi should have ended it all years ago and i do not see myself making it to 2022 at this rate... i cannot seem to enjoy anything anymore and I am actively miserable and i do not know what to do,Depression

19327,I am scheduled for my first session of therapy but I honestly do not see the point. they are going to drug me up and trick my brain into thinking I am happy. I cannot see that possibly happening. Every day that goes by I feel like I become worse. I am tired of people feeling sorry for me and I am tired of my depression ruin the friendships I have. I just want to disappear. I tried tricking myself into doing happy things like going on a date and at the end I felt worse than before. It seems my life is a one way path to dying alone and all my friends getting sick of my existence. I do not even have the motivation to cry any more. there is a wave of anxiety and sadness constantly drowning me and I just feel dead inside. I do not see how anyone or anything can help me any more. I just feel that everyone gets sick of me at some point or another and I am at the point where I feel dead inside.,Depression

22721,Today my cousin dropped by bags packed ready for a week vacation here with us. I asked her why she was here and she said because she wanted to as if nothing was helding her back a pang of envy washed over me dumbfounded even. She went and knocked on my parents room and greeted them barely awake since we have all just woken up she could do that to open doors and not be greeted with disdain she could walk without having to be on thin ice like me she was like that. breakfast came and we have moved on to family matters. How was your mom? how is the business? and she would say everything is okay. My mom asks why are not you helping her right now? and she answered because their shop was too hot for her just like that she had a choice I realized. My mother whispered you should help as if she was a bad child but i could feel the guilt on her voice as if she too realized it is not true. My cousin gave a look reassuring her it does not reallt matter because my mother never guilt trips me about it She had that freedom. I forget sometimes this emotions that claw out of my heart that take root into my head. I envy and I feel numb angry and confused. Why me? why do I have to settle for hot rarely cold? why must I force myself to forget years of abuse because their nice now they will not hurt me anymore. I am angry. I am envious. and most importantly I am too scared to die. I am jealous.,Depression
9857,This is my final attempt at life I cannot go on no longer. I can feel it I only have a few days before I take my life. I am not Gods strongest warrior. I cannot bear the tests He is giving me. I tried so hard to be the person she wanted me to be. But its so hard for me to change and I drove her away. I know it may not seem like much but 8 months and a day after we were done she said she is ready to move on. Did she even love me. I drove around in a frantic craze trying to find an open therapy spot but its Sunday and nothing is open. Its currently 1029 PM today and I can feel my lifeforce draining slowly. I am at my wits end. Someone please save me. The only reason I have not taken my own life is because according to the bible people who take their own life go to hell. But i do not want to go to hell. I just want the pain to stop. I have been hurt so much by my stupid actions and I put the last of my energy into this relationship. She promised that she would not leave and would stay by my side to try and better myself. Did she love me. The voices are getting louder and I cannot control it. It seems to spiral at nighttime when I am alone. I do not like sleeping alone all I could remember is cuddling with her. Why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why WHAT IS IS WRNG WITH ME. I cannot TAKE IT ANYMORE SOMEONE SAVE ME PLEASE My Last Cry for Help Life,Depression

24837,I am a make and I am 16 and I just broke up with my gf. When I was little I was touched by a girl in my school and she kept doing it even after I said no. Although I told my close friends what happened they told me I was a loser and that I should have liked it. Sometimes when I go to sleep at night I can still hear there voices telling me I am a loser and my recent relationship did not help. During the relationship I felt like I was more of a therapist than I was her boyfriend and she dumped all of her problems and issues on to me and expected me to be able to make her feel better every time. This made me feel horrible about myself because anytime I did not make her feel better we would have an argument and then he would say she was wrong and apologize. We have had more than 60 arguments over our 6 month relationship. And anytime I would ask my friends if I should break up with her they would say no. But during my last two weeks of school my parents told me I could not call anyone or play games so my grades would stay up. The same friends that told me not to break up with her told her to break up with me for not talking to her. I broke up with her because she wants me to give her 6 hours a day and anytime I ask for time to myself she would see upset. I hate myself right now and I do not know why. I have cut myself multiple times and have to pretend like everything is ok when in reality I am 5 seconds away from breaking down. I do not want to seem emotional because I feel like my friends are just going to tell me I am overreacting and it is not as bad as I am making it. I am scared to tell my parents because I feel like they will see me differently. If anyone could give me some help I would love it or at least some advice on what to do I would love it. Sorry for the long entry. Recently have been thinking about killing myself a lot,Depression
9224,Honestly why does it have to be like this? No matter what I do the outcome is always the same. It sucks how others have a lot of privilege and look down on others. An escape from this reality would be great but I have to remain strong for my baby brother. I hate having to pretend,Depression
47200,I need therapy. I don't like posting anything about myself online because in the long run I feel like it only makes things worse but i need advice from people with experience. I'm 30 years old and despite having a job that allows me to pay the bills I feel the lowest I've ever felt in my life. I'm mentally and physically exhausted the majority of the day and despite making changes in my diet and exercise I feel completely empty.I felt better and more alive when I spent my weekends heavily drinking even though those nights would usually end with me having heart palpitations and feeling like I was going to die. At least when I was inebriated I could feel a spark of the happiness I had when I was younger and that feeling made me want to drink more and more just to keep that spark alive. Unfortunately now when I drink I get panic attacks that take days for me to get over so it's not even an option for me anymore.For the first time in my life I'm considering therapy because at this point I don't know what other alternative to turn to. The only reason its taken me this long to consider it an option is because I feel like I already know what a therapist would say to me. As pessimistic and presumtuous as it is it seemed pointless. I'll admit It would be nice to vent to someone but is that really all there is to it? I have to be wrong.I'm going to look for a therapist first thing tomorrow but in the meantime I want to hear from those of you with experience. Did any of you share similar skepticism and end up surprised by the results? Thanks in advance for your input.,Depression
47438,Im so done bro Ive been depressed for two years now and my boyfriend says to just take cold showers. He says that we was also depressed and he got cured just by thinking It is what it is taking cold showers and realizing it was all just mental. Idk man he mustve gotten really lucky..

25963,...So I could feel like I had a reason to be depressed. Like I deserved sympathy or empathy for my depression. I am good looking intelligent employed and empty inside. I was emotionally neglected but not obviously so. Anyone who would understand has had it worse than me it seems so what do I have to complain about? it is as if my depression is unjustified. Like there is no reason to ask for help because I should not need it in the first place. And yet I move through life without meaning and a fabricated purpose. I feel unseen and like I do not deserve to be seen because I have not suffered enough and my low sense of self is unworthy selfloathing. Why speak up about feelings I should not have? Just suffer silently and one day I will enjoy the sweet release of death and only you anonynous Redditors will have heard the voiceless words of my sadness I kind of wish my life had been worse...,Depression

13058,Just turned 22 you.S male.So I have really bad cPTSD. Tons of bullying by male peers and teachers physical abuse at school and serious bloody batterings at home psychological abuse bad relationship between parents that cultivated in an absent father and a drugaddicted mother that either overdosed or killed herself in front of me naked sexually physically and mentally abusive 4year relationship with an older girl workplace bullying sexual harassment at concerts abusive HS principal suspended me constantly for no reason dragged me out of class etc. social ostracization etc.there is all that but last year I was exually assaulted by a friend of 10 years. Afterwards I tried to engage in a playfight because she was angry drunk and no one asked if I was ok and I wanted to lighten the mood. One of her defenders said she beat the shit out of you verbatim. She punched me in the face like 5 times left a ton of huge bruises and sprained my elbow. it is on film. After that happened I blacked out on alcohol for the first time ever. Afterwards I received serious abuse and harassment. People I did not even know were messaging me calling me a psychopath a liar someone told me if you keep falsely accusing her you will end up in jail and actually get exually assaulted after implying I drove my mother to suicide. it is been going on for a year now the girl also falsely accused me of rpe to get out of the situation. Her friends and my at the time friends were sick people. she is popular and clearly I am a doormat and the abuse and gaslighting and event itself just made me lose my fucking marbles for about a year straight and I was in a constant paranoid drunken state. I guess this was just the tipping point for me. I could not handle it and I just lost it and never slept or cleaned my room and quit my job and attempted uicide.How do I get out of this place? The trauma keeps coming back. it is awful and I feel insane. Am I a bad person or can repetitive trauma and abuse like this make you lose your mind? I am scared. I feel like I am in traumadepressioninsomnia induced psychosis. Anyone relate? Need help,Depression

I have been super tired have insomnia too randomly crying and feeling heavy? I am easily irritated too. The negative things going on around me is kind of affecting me as well because I am sensitive and I feel upset that I cannot help these people struggling?

I am hoping for a chance to breathe again. I am young not old but I have been through it all and I do not think its fair to carry this all by myself. But carry it all I shall. Id carry it all to the top of the world and jump down to hell if it meant your mind would be free. God I miss your feeling your everlasting freedom to touch. I remember the old and was starting to laugh. Thinking what the hell I was worried about but now now I am ashamed.

12617,TW SELF HARM Last night one of my cousins who I am very close with told me she needed to tell me something important. She told me I could not tell anyone and that she is been going through a tough time and working on this issue by herself. I was anxious to hear what she said and then she sent me pictures of her wrist all slit up. I was at lost for words. I truly did not know what to say. I have been on this boat and still did not know how to help her. I told her to speak to me on what is going on and also speak to her counselor in college. I also recommended her to a telepsychiatrist who could speak to her and prescribe her affordable medication without insurance so that know one would know. I offered to pay for it too. Our family is not too supportive on mental health.Its upsetting and I wish I could help more. She lives in a different state and I just do not know what to do. I love my little cousin and too lose her would be too much on my heart. Did I do the right thing? Medications were not too helpful for me but they got me through so maybe it was not that helpful? I am still in shock and not sure what else to say to her. Maybe I should have said something else. I just want to help. My cousin sent me a picture of her wrist.,Depression

47156,I'm so tired of trying to be okay. When I don't exercise regularly my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to go into social settings and interact with others especially friends semiregularly my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to switch up my routine it happens and it happens when I have no routine. It happens when I don't get enough sleep when I don't spend enough time outside and the list goes on. It's exhausting. And while a lot of these habitsthings are enjoyable in the moment once I push past my but I don't wanna inner toddler brain I'm so sick of having to do so much all the time just to maintain okay.And truth be told lately I haven't. Life has been unnecessarily shitty and I've had to make so many decisions and compromises on big things like my job and living situation that I crumpled. And I know working out would make a much bigger difference to my mood right now than writing this post but I'm sick of everything. Why does life insist on being such a shit show?Update After writing this briefly texting with a redditor who was kind enough to reach out to ask if I'm okay and feeling my feelings for a bit aka crying I put on my workout clothes and got it over with. It didn't do much right then and there but I also went to bed on time to get a proper night's rest and I woke up feeling a little better. So up and onwards I go until the next time I veer off track managing myself. Because there really isn't an alternative. I know how low I get when I throw in the towel and don't pick it back up again quickly enough. ,Depression
38944,i know i ve already started this off pretty negative but i acknowledge that over the year i ve made a lot of progress with social anxiety i do thing now that i never thought i d be able to do presentation networking event planning hosting party however every time i do any of these thing or even small thing like having to run a work meeting i feel physically anxious my heart pound and i start doubting myself and my hand shake and i have to push through it because there s not usually another option i ve gotten better at it for sure and i m proud of that but sometimes it really just chip away at me i m about to cry tonight over something so minuscule that i ll probably look back on it in a few week and say wow that wa a dumb thing to worry about because that is what always happens i ve probably wasted day of my life just worrying about thing that didn t end up being worthy of that much worry i overthink thing so much and i just wish i could turn it off so badly to so many people now i appear to be this leader that ha shit together but in reality i struggle quietly with the most basic thing and i just feel so embarrassed sometimes i just wish i could turn off the social anxiety it get so frustrating,Depression
24190,Just reread this post and it is a little over the place but it is late and I want to go to sleep so I will just post it like this.Even as a little kid I did not have interests. My mom used to get me to try different hobbies but I did not like any of them. Maybe that was an early sign of what was to come.it is sad to see someone as young as me not doing anything other than going to school and to the gym. By the way I have not seen any progress in my body for years now despite lifting often I just cannot bring myself to eat 3000 calories a day because I do not have discipline. I have only gotten physically stronger so I guess I am the skinny guy lifting comically high weight at the gym. And while I am lifting I am thinking of how I do not enjoy doing it.I just do not feel joy from doing anything. I have not been happy since I was a child and even then I had my dark times. it is a shame my parents have spent a lot of time effort and money on me. So far I have managed to stay alive for them.let us talk about friends shall we? I do not have many.I live in a small city of around 150000 people. It seems like everybody knows each other except for me. Every time I go out with the little friends I have who are I believe catching on to the fact that I only like hanging out when there is alcohol involved they greet so many people and I am the dumbass that is just standing there being sad.I do want to get better but I am in 4th year of secondary school 11th grade and I think it may be too late to start building a personality. I am just a she will without interests or hobbies. I guess I can be kind of funny when I am drunk so that is why my friends keep me around.I am the only virgin in my friend group which can get horribly depressing sometimes. I play it as a byproduct of being gay in a small city but it is really just because I have no social skills and I do not enjoy being alive. I have never had any hobbies or interests. I know no one outside of school. How do I build a personality?,Depression
9849,There was a time I was very talkative and somewhat of a leader in my friend groups. I loved meeting new people over the mic on the internet. I had a good handful of friends IRL aswell.Now after 3 years of depression and anxiety I am a robot. I have set ways of sitting automatic responses and am just always so drained. I spend all my time either thinking about or researching depression and anxiety. I basically have no hobbies except for this and cut off all my friends in favor of isolating.How do I change back? My single mom is so old it makes me terrified and feel awful thinking she will be seeing me like this for the rest of her life when things used to be so happy... please if anyone has any suggestions I would appreciate it so much Depression and anxiety have become my personality,Depression
16131,I am not sure if its just me but I feel the weekends are the worst. I like that I do not have school but I am just reminded that I do not like where my life is at the moment. I am lonely as hell right nowand I am trying to pick up the pieces of a recent episode I had. I was not really able to study and I am sure I just failed my most recent exam. My room is a mess cannot get myself to get up and put away clothes and dishes. Its the loneliness that is really getting to me. I got sent home from college and I do not really know many people in my hometown. My friends are busy live away from me or in relationships. Its the weekends I notice that I spend most of my day in my room. I have a huge void in my day because I broke up with my boyfriend last week. I did not realize how much of my day I spent talking to him but even before that we could only talk at certain times. He was horrible emotionally abusive at times but I miss him. I am just struggling to get my life back on track. My meds help with some symptoms but not enough to help me get through the day. I went to work today so I am proud of that. Anyone else find the weekends to be difficult Weekends are the Worst,Depression
38974,asking because i m not sure and it just happened yesterday so the memory is still fresh from what i ve learned panic attack can make people genuinely believe they re dying or like their throat is closing up but i don t get that feeling for me i feel like i can t get enough air and that every time i have to take a deep breath but taking slow breath is really hard and near impossible sometimes and when i do try to breathe normal or deep breath i get dizzy like the act of taking in the air make my head spin causing me to feel more uncomfortable and disoriented i ll also get racing thought centered around how people interact with me will want to talk to me have spoken to me how i m a failure how people would be better off not knowing me how i ve fucked up in the past and so on when i get those thought it get really hard to slow them down and breathe yesterday when it happened i wa literally just in bed hugging my pillow really tightly because of the stress trying to focus on the music but it took roughly 0min 0min before i fully calmed down is this normal is this a panic attack or something else even though i didn t believe i wa dying or felt like my throat wa closing up if this is a panic attack how the fuck am i supposed to stop it or help it deep breath don t help meditation make it a thousand time worse trying grounding technique make it worse too knowing i don t have trick to end it make me feel worse during it,Depression
23544,I am alone and I mean it I have not left my house besides work for 6 months I am 22 years olds now but when I was like 1621 I was major manwhore and an a tad bit full of my self thinking I could get any girl I want. Unsurprisingly I ended up with the same type of people like me I mean these kids lived everyday of there lives with 2 goals let us drink or smoke and let us get some py. so when I turned 21 had a family issue that resolved but was so fucked up I wanted to go to therapy just to vent and talk to someone that was a frat bro with the IQ of Patrick from sponge bob. While there I brought up the fact I am bisexual and when I was 18ish I finally understood why I was a man whore because I was scared to accept who I am and I was even more scared of anyone else catching on. So the only way I can 100 make sure not one thinks I am bi was to show the world I get it girls After many sessions and a few months fly by I am therapist got me to understand that there is nothing wrong about what I am and asked me if I was ready to come out of the closet because by this point I was so deep in it I found Narnia. I said Ill think about it I am not really sure.Later the night I was laying in bed and was half asleep still thinking about should I come out etc. I just said F it and posted it then crashed. I woke up the next morning to find all my friends calling me a Faot and my family basically cutting me off. While there was a massive amount of support from randoms on my face book my friends and familyruined all of it. I was kicked out of my friend group completely they blocked me and kicked me out the group chat because I snapped out when they called me a Faot and my family told me that I was an embarrassment and told me to go change my name because I was no longer part of THERE family. In one day alone I lost everyone I ever cared about and that hurt but what hurt the most was realizing they did not care about me because if Its been like 6 months no contact form any of them. My birthday was 8 days ago and my mother did not even call. I have tried to make new friends I found someone who was not homophobic as fuck and we always hung out and shit played Xbox but now that its public I am bi he was labeled as a gay guy destroying his reputation and he was constantly bullied and laughed at causing him to stop being friends with me and I truly do not blame him.I did not post this for sympathy so I am sorry if it feels that way I just needed to tell someone and vent all this sadness and anger I have. I feel like I am invisible yes I am alive and okay for now but I am slowing sinking in to the abyss in front of everyone but no one can hear me so matter how loud I scream. I cannot Believe 2 words to fucking words I am bi can because so much pain How one day and 2 words can drop you off the cliff so deep you cannot even see the light. I do not think Ill ever get out,Depression

25952,each task even as simple as getting out of bed seems too much for me sometimes it is hard to describe depression in words but metaphorically speaking it feels like you are in the water drowning and trying to stay afloat at the same time. I have lost so much in my life I could not think of one person to call or text to talk to . I feel like if I even talk about having depression people would just dismiss me just life they have done so in the past with comments such as you are too young to have depression I am 21 other people have it much worse you probably just sad try to be happy. I feel like it is an endless cycle and it is a cycle I am getting increasingly tired of and I cannot seem to fight anymore. Everyone has given up on me and I feel like I am giving up on me too. Therapy is so expensive and getting a doctor's appointment face to face during covid is near impossible. I have no social support whatsoever. I do not have any hope anymore and most days I feel like I am just drowning waiting for the water to take me in. endless melancholy losing hope,Depression
26970,Honestly I am so damn boring. Like.. its a main reason why I do not date anyone. Nothing really interests me so I do not have much to talk about. I suck at all conversations and once again I am so boring. When i was a kid I had a personality I was funny and goofy and happy. Now I am just a dead zombie that will laugh at things in public to not seem depressed. But my brain is so dead from depression I cannot come up with any jokes or shit. The only thing I can do is listen and barely speak which I actually hate. I want to be funny and have a personality and be desirable but I am not that. I know its depression that causes it. Depression makes me SO boring,Depression

25422,My depression and anxiety have become allconsuming at this point. I wake up feeling heavy and with this feeling of having a massive weight on my chest. It takes me hours to get out of bed and even when I do the nausea that follows it can be pretty bad.I have been doing weekly therapy for six months and I still feel like its getting worse. I used to talk to my SO about this but I feel like a burden and do not want to her to think that this is all I am now. I have had bad side effects to all antidepressant medication I have tried so there is not much I can do on that side. I feel like I am losing this battle day by day and the intrusive thoughts are just getting worse. I do not know what else to try. I want to stop feeling like such a failure but that is difficult when all I want to do is hide. It was not always this bad and that is what keeps me going. But that little bit of hope is getting harder to listen to. It is getting harder and harder to wake up every morning,Depression
14583,The person who smiles at you and tells you how great their life is probably feels similar to you. Many people experience sexual verbal or physical abuse. The person you are so jealous of could be a day away from suicide. I cannot promise anyone here anything but you might as well post your story here. If no one replies they are probably in a similar situation and scared to give you advice.Many people who commit suicide immediately regret it and try to save themselves. This is why it is so difficult to drown yourself because your body literally will fight your brain about killing yourself. Not to mention the fact that people end up mentally retarded or other physically handicaps from suicide. it is NOT THE ANSWER!!!!! if you are reading this DO NOT COMMIT SUICIDE.,Depression

16420,I think I just had what they call a nervous breakdown. I got triggered by a slight disagreement with my wife and then I absolutely exploded. I ran to the bedroom and cried intensely for at least three hours. Probably the worst I have ever felt emotionally so now I am dealing with the feeling of guilt plus knowing I let down my wife and kids by not going to a birthday party with them. My wife is confused and doesent understand what happened and I am not really sure myself. My best guess is it from stuffing emotions and I had finally just hit my limit Just had a breakdown,Depression

24449,it is completely out of the blue now...usually I am reminded of something or I will see something random and I will just start to tear up in front of people for absolutely no reason. I am usually very tethered but lately I am just so tired...I am so tired of living and I would never have the guts to kill myself...but every morning I wake up with such incredible sadness amp I wish I would never been born in the first place. It just seems like nothing ever goes my way and it is getting worse. It feels like I have never been really happy and usually I will drown it out with friends but now even that does not work. I cannot afford therapy and I do not know what to do. I just wish I could not feel anything again. I have began to publically cry,Depression

25290,When i was 12 my dad had a stroke I am 21 now. I was the youngest sibling between me and my brother so i could not help. I was not able to help and now its really starting to show. I used to cut and i stopped 6 months ago because i met this amazing guy who i love. He helps me through it most of the time but he does not know how to help me now. All through high school i had no friends and i was bullied a lot. I hated myself. I had been sexually abused and physically abused in most of my romantic relationships. And me and my bf have been working through my insecurities. But on to the real problem once i got into college which i moved 6 hours away from all of it i struggled to make friends. I finally made a few and they were very toxic people to be with and they graduated. This past year i grew close with a small group of friends. I got into this relationship and at first they were upset cuz i did not hang out as much but they grew to like him. Me and him had a major fight i did not want to be alone so i called my friends. They immediately blamed my boyfriend and said it was all his fault. I started the fight it was all my fault and i explained that to them but in their eyes he did all the wrong. Later that night he proposed to me and i said yes theirs no ring yet so we agreed on just still saying bf and gf until there is a ring. This upset my friends again and they did not like the fact i was still with him.Its a month past that fight and all of my so called friends went camping without me. I never got an invite but someone who they barely hang with did which kind of makes it hurt a lot more. And they have been posting on their storys about going out and drinking and doing karaoke all of which I have never been invited to this past month. Which really hurts but it also made me realise something. I have never been to a Halloween party but they all went to one this past year. They all planned each others birthdays and we did nothing for my 21st because i did not put it together. Shortly after the fight one of them turned 21 and they did not plan it but i also was not invited and got told the line on it was just a last minute thing so not everyone was invited. I saw all their storys and i was the only one not there. All of this hit me really hard when i thought about how i was never really invited and if i was it was always last minute. And i also thought about how this is our senior year and Ill have to see them every day in classes and work with them because We are all theatre majors. I do not know what to do anymore because i cannot cut myself I am 6 months sober. And i do not want to drink or smoke to forget and have another addiction. I am just not in a good place and my bf can see that but nothing helps how i feel. I cannot cope,Depression
25374,HelloI dated a depressive girl for 6 months we fall in love and shared our deepest secret recently we been in a lot of fights because of the depression I did not understand why she has pushed me away and telling me she love me and I was precious I though that I was the problem so we was fighting than get back than fighting and backOne day I told her that we could make 30 days break to see how things going on and as an idiot with ADD what I have I forgot that in the same conversation she told me having abandon issueso we discuss and we argue then I told I been watched vids about healthy relationship and that for that I been thinking about it and she told me yes but that women have not depression and that knocked me out and I just got that I was a pure idiot we argued and been kind of okay I just felt I was the problem all along and did not see the depressionthen I educated myself about depression to understand how to well communicate and that was not my fault she pushed me away but too late I broke her heart and we been on big discussion I just lisened her than repeat what she was telling to show her I truly understand than explain her why she feel as an idiot to gave me so much power over her emotion and she feel I jeopardize her feeling and I always coming on methan we watched a movie together she is explained me the joke without that I ask her because I am French and than I asked her how do she is feeling and she told me neutral way but on the good way for the moment than this morning I send her a message GoodmorningSmall message to tell you that I appreciate the moment we did share Yesterday I appreciate that you been explaining jokes I missed out also explain to me about the question to ask myself when I am craving food that helping me you make me feel so good !

9213,Usually I can deal with my depression but now it is just hitting harder.Earlier this year I had to deal with a really traumatizing situation due COVID and I held my feelings to myself so I could be strong I have a post about in case anyone's wondering. But now I am feeling that the weight of those feelings are coming for me making me feel worse everyday.I am slowly stopping talking to people sleepy more and more eating less I am slowly stopping enjoying the things I enjoy slowly drawing in this feeling. I was feeling my best a few weeks ago but after being rejected by my dream job I cannot snap out of it.I see my friends and boyfriend getting their first jobs doing and achieving amazing things making their own money. I will graduate from college next year and I feel like a failure for not having a job too. I am really proud of them truly but I am also dead jealous of them. This feeling is rotting in me making me feel like I do not have any perspective feel like my dreams are more distant than they were before and I am too tired to run after them. Everytime I see my friends at their jobs I feel sad. Sad because I feel like I am useless and everytime I try to talk about it all I get is empty words.I do not know what to do this feeling is taking away the best of me. I am this close of giving up,Depression
24367,I am a 22 year old depressed trust fund kid who does not have a job but is in college. I do not work because I hate all the jobs I have tried multiple places already and have so much job experience. Any recommendations of part time jobs for a college student that might make me happier and less of a loser I am in college because I want to be educated and it costs me nothing to become educated also I am depressed because all I do is stay home with no social life whatsoever 22 and depressed,Depression
9132,From a young age I was always a lot smarter than the average kid I loved this till I was about 12. After that it was always the pressure that I am supposed to be the best. and past the age of 12 it is all my parents care about. They could not care less if I am happy as long as I get good grades that is all that matters now. Most people do not understand one bit. I wish I was not so smart. My dream is to become an artist and live in a little cottage. But that cannot happen. I am set up to become a biologist. that is what my grandpa did. I am too young to already know that I am just going to spend the rest of my life doing something I hate. ampx200BBeing smart also means that teachers do not care about my mental health. it is the extra work that kills me. I am practically still a kid. I cannot take all the work. it is all too much. I am not even working towards my goals in life I am working towards what I have to do. I hate it. I have no choice. I know for a fact that I have to be a scientist for my family not disown me. they have paid for my private schooling I cannot just not do what they want. ampx200BAll I want is to be happy but I cannot. I should enjoy school because I am smart but I do not.,Depression
21048,And I am tiredI struggle for essentially nothing. I keep pushing myself regardless but nothing really changes. I work out meditate..try to eat right but nothing changes even when it does bc ultimately yea its all for nothing. I do not think Ill ever get over the fact regardless of being sick. Its all so pointlessnearly impossible to value anythingall amounts to nothing more than a distraction from suffering..seemingly all there isnothings worth the bother. Its hard not to see death as the only answer bc I have tried and things do not get better.just distractions prolonging the inevitableIll always be tired It is like playing pretend,Depression

21937,I have been going to therapy and taking antidepressants for over a year now which reallyyyy helped me to deal with my depressive episodes even better and be more active in my everyday life.Lately I have been feeling pretty stable everything is fine since I am on holidays but when I am alone and breathe in I can feel this really weird depressive emptiness inside my chest. I cannot really describe it but it feels like a very very deep inner sadness.I will not have therapy for 6 more weeks now but I really need to know what this feeling is. Indescribable depressive empty feeling inside my chest when I am alone,Depression
14126,I forgot what real problems were lol. I forget I am depressed so often.anyways I have not brushed my teeth in a while and my dentist was a real dick about it and now I want to cry. he even judged my personal life choices like wtf I want guages what is wrong with that. I have gingivitis lol I want to kill myself I am a failure. I know this is not a huge deal but my body cannot handle stress at all. I have been inside my own head for months and now I am terrified all over again. I am scared of this body. my first reaction is to kill myself. I want to die again. this makes me suicidal when I am normally suicidal over cartoons and nothing.I am fucking broken and worthless ahah. I lied to my mom. I am a fucking coward and a loser. hah.I am going to break down nowI know there is no good excuse for not brushing your teeth. but I am depressed. even on a good day. I do not know maybe that is nothing haha. I really want to kill my body. I have had hardly any stress today and I am already ready to curl up and die. let me die I KNOW ITS NOT AN EXCUSE BUT JESUS I am FALLING APART,Depression

21474,Why am I alive? I asked myself And for a second I could not think of anything.But then I realised even though I just turned 21 I have lived a life full of stories.Stories..some makes you smile some just makes you want to scream your heart out. And to be honest it would make hell of a book or a movie script.To tell these stories one day I must live.I must live to tell little girls they are not alone. I must live to let go of all these secrets one day.I must live to get the justice I deserve.I must live to sleep without crying one day.I must live to live a life I want.So next time whenever Ill ask myself why am I alive..Ill know the answer too Why am I alive? I asked..,Depression

16425,I am in my 4th year of college with 3 more miserable years to go if I decide to keep up with school. Last semester I had a nervous breakdown and gave up on my classes and now I have all Ws to show for it.I have worked only fast food jobs for 4 years and my latest job is El Pollo Loco where I work 8 hrs shifts with 40 mins worth of break for the entire day. Its tiring work.I mean I feel so fucking low compared to everyone else. How does anyone fucking go on living? How do you people get up every day?,Depression
18572,I feel so lost. I am in college but I feel like a loser because I am an older student. I feel so behind in life and like I should just give up because I am not good enough. I am stupid and cannot do anything right.I am not the child my parents wanted. My cousins and other relatives are successful and married and attractive and it freaking hurts. The man I wanted told me he did not want a relationship then rubbed his new significant other in my face I feel so broken ugly and unwanted. The person I was supposed to marry awhile back is engaged to the person they cheated on me with. Why does no one want me? Why do not I make anyone happy?I hate my job. I feel like they hate me. I do not belong. anywhere. No one would miss me if I was gone. I cry everyday and I feel like I have no where to turn. I hurt everyday wondering why I have to be the ugly loser no. One ever wanted and why I am so sad all the time. I am sorry for all this but I needed to get it out because I have no one to turn I am so fucking depressed and I do not know what to do,Depression
13711,This is going to be my senior year and I see all these classmates hanging out and having fun. I wish I had that. I reminisce of the times I was able to do that with my friend group in middle school. And I cry thinking about how Ill never experience it ever again. We were close but of course friendships fade especially when you go to different highschools but we still hung out every now and then but now I know we will not. I do not think any of us have reentered such a tight knit friend group like we had before and since our friends passing we just realized we would never be that tight knit group anymore. I wish I had that support system I hate feeling lonely now. I see classmates posting about them going bowling and playing at Dave and busters. I hate them I hate that I cannot have what they have I hate my life. I have contemplated suicide before but I have never acted upon it today is the first day that i selfed harmed. I do not think Ill ever fit in to a new group I do not think Ill ever be happy again. I do not think Ill ever be happy,Depression
15362,Lately I have lost enjoyment in things I do I even completely stopped masturbating even though I used to do it alot. I am afraid to go outside because I feel like my presence makes a negative impact on the people around me even though that makes no sense. At night I overthink and I just imagine being completely betrayed andor am being l lied to without knowing. I do not know who to talk to because I feel like they will say I am being over dramatic and I am self diagnosing to get attention. I show some symptoms of depression without having anything to be depressed about,Depression
10520,Really just writing this for me but maybe some of you relate to it too. Explaining using that Disney movie Inside Out as a metaphor.I do not cut myself for attention the last thing I want is attention. I am shrouded in self hatred so why would I want other people to pile onto that. I cut myself to feel control to feel like I have a choice in the narrative that I am experiencing. it is the only way I know how.It would be like if the 5 main characters of the movie were living their life but there was also a secret 6th character repression. He got thrown into that forgotten memories pit but he clawed his way back out holding a grudge. He broke into central control and is holding the other emotions hostage. They are forced to watch him ruin the life they made and cannot do anything about it. They have no control and can only watch what unfolds. They can give suggestions like go to bed on time or exercise but he will not take that advice. So finally to feel some sense of control in this hell they suggest something he will like. Why do not we cut ourselves Knowing full well it will just make things worse it is a last ditch attempt at having some relief. And it sucks.That probably did not make any sense at all idk sorry. Why I cut myself,Depression
23411,I literally have no one except my mother.

20189,The only thing i keep myself alive for is self pityful hope in therapy. I am extremely irresponsible often skip meds and do not bring test results on time. Obviously they are not working. My therapist and I do not have chemistry and I ever only had a slither of hope when she was confident in my first diagnosis during my first session. I have seen her numerous times and tried various medication but nothing seems to work even when I take it responsibly but I guess i do not endure enough long. I am sabotaging my own promise. Most recently I was on olanzapine aripiprazole and eftil. She proposed to try lithium salts but obviously i skipped the necessary tests because of how much of a failure I am.I have nothing else to try for. I will talk to her one last time and if nothing promising happens that is it. I promised before ending it all to give one last pityful attempt to therapy and its not working.,Depression

22618,I am just coming to the realization that if I do not reach out my friends will not reach out to me. If I do not go see my friends they will just hang out without me. If I disappeared would they even notice? I have a friend I have not talked to in 2 months. I tried reaching out several times in the beginning and was met with silence. Nothing happened I just became irrelevant. Maybe I am just not enough All my friendships are one sided,Depression
22816,I am sure more people feel the same way I do. I am 24 almost 25 and I have pretty much zero experience with women. Never had a girlfriend. I had my first sexual experience this past year with this girl who came onto me full force at a dinner party my friend threw in a random evening. I did not even realize she was hitting on me until she kissed me out of nowhere. The next day I went to her house and we did some stuff but I was so incredibly nervous that it was a complete disaster. I could not enjoy the moment whatsoever and I feel very sad about it. I am not ashamed about the sexual experience itself being a disaster nor about the fact that it happened so late in my life or the lack of experience in general for all these years. I do not really care for that. What I really crave is affection. I just want to be loved to hold hands to kiss hug and cuddle and subsequently the sex will have it is role but I do not see it as the main focus. That day I spent with that girl although I had my first sexual experience it was the affection and attention part that filled my void. I did not see her again since then if you are wondering.I have spent my teens without much of a care for this and entering on my 20's as well. Always been a loner and on good terms with that. But now the loneliness is starting to hit me hard as I see my close friends in long term relationships for years with the same person and some of them already having children forming families etc. I do not know man... I have been successful in my friendships both with men and women and I am very grateful for that. But in romantic relationships it is the polar opposite. it is like a dark side of me that I do not want to think about or want people to know. I am tired of being alone. I am not sexually frustrated I am emotonally frustrated.,Depression
47943,Afraid to have a personality Did anyone else have very few hobbies or interests growing up? I'm 20m and for the past 4 years I haven't gotten into any hobbies or interesting things. I have a hard time relating to people because I don't have anything to talk about. It feels like I don't have a personality. My whole life has been dedicated to pleasing others. Doing what I think they want me to do saying what I think they want me to say. I'm struggling with having interests because I honestly don't even know what I like. Because of this I don't really have any longterm goals for my career hobbies personal growth etc. I just want to be a normal functioning member of society but I'm struggling to find an identity. I end up laying in bed all day working towards nothing because I'm too scared to even try. Anyways those are my thoughts. Hopefully some of you can relate.,Depression
18660,there is no words to accurately describe what I am feeling but free falling and doom are words i would use. I often find myself questioning if I am faking my emotions or always assume ill be better in a few days. After about 2 years i feel the exact same way there is always a voice in my head saying I am a fraud and I am doing it to myself. Despite feeling this way I am able to shower and appear fine to the outside world. My big question is am i really depressed if i can still function and take showers etc. which is a total stereotype. I have heard the words high functioning depression but not sure what that entails. Am i really depressed.,Depression

47165,31f I hate my life I know it just comes with trauma that I have no idea how to compact and I feel so behind..I live at home with my mom because of student loans from a degree I had to drop out of because her credit score wasn't good enough and neither was mine. I now sit with 80k in student debt and only 20k would be gone if Biden finally wipes away student debt..My mom right now has been more anxiety inducing than before. I get it I'm overweight I have mental health issues need some sun and a better job but it doesn't help when she berates and complains about it daily and comparing me to others.I barely eat as it is and while she serves unhealthy food as well she gets mad that I'm not eating healthy and moving like a fucking swan. I'm like 200 lbs full of anxiety different kinds of odd combinations of grass and veggies in some green smoothies that tastes like eating someone's ass that hasn't showered for 3 years. Still gets mad that I eat unhealthy when she makes it and it's literally all we have.She gets mad that I don't spend time with her at all and prefer to hang out with my friends that are online. She tells me I look ugly and I should look better in clothes that look ugly on me as it is. Literally she treats me just like my older brother did minus the sexual abuse I endured for 14 fucking years which ended when I was 26 by leaving to art school and finally having a way to make it end by severing ties with him well he did it with meBeing yelled at because I get anxious or depressed isn't a way to help someone unpack trauma nor help them get motivated about doing better.It's gotten so bad I can't focus on anything very well. I don't even have privacy to go and study to be a data analyst in Coursera because school is really expensive nowadays and i don't have the time to be able to go.I feel really stuck. And I know many people are gonna say it's procrastination and I get it might be but it stems from an overflowing and everchanging amounts of anxiety and depression that has never stopped. I can't afford therapy because that shit isn't covered nor can I drive to one because I don't have a car nor do I have the money to pay for an Uber drive weekly along with whatever fee therapy comes with.bi also never have privacy so I can't do at home therapy. I have so little privacy my mom barges in and tries to talk to me even though I tell her I'm in a literal meeting. But if I try to set boundaries or do things myself I'm called an asshole... It's so much thrown at me I feel like I just freeze and just sit and do nothing because that's better than sitting with her and possibly be yelled and berated at for my weight for the umpth time even though she's heavy and diabetic herself.Yeah..My live sucks right now...,Depression

26553,In the past 2 months we were constantly arguing starting again for a week then arguing again and again. it is got to a point where she told me that everything I said annoyed her. But now we are good again we are finally texting somewhat as we used to and began to see each other again. I had a mental breakdown one night and I told her that I would give everything just so it could be as it was before we started arguing she said that it will not happen again and that I need to get over it. I must note important I note that we were not dating at least not officially she never wanted a relationship but we spent many nights together and she called it something between friends and a relationship. Now to the reason I do not believe we are done. First off it is the second time she said we will be just friends and that she does not see anything more of it but still we ended up another two months being together after that. After she drunkenly told me that she too feels something to me but she is afraid so she lied to me she does not feel anything. And the second reason is that even though she told me we will be just friends she still comes over to my house on the same day she told me there will be nothing more to us and cuddle with me all night. So what do you think? Do I have a reason to not believe her in this or should I accept we are done? She told me we will not be anything but friends again but I cannot get myself to believe her. Is it justified by my side or am I just in doubt?,Depression
38661,i wanted to share some of what i ve written because i find that writing is an outlet that help me to calm down sometimes i sit in a room full of people and stay quiet the loud chatter and the chaos of laughter will fill the room fill my head yet i keep my opinion and question to myself i keep my thought contained in my mind i watch a the girl who betrayed me smile and continues to talk i watch a my friend all happily converse with one another i watch a the boy throw their head back unable to control their laughter they ask if i am okay more quiet than usual and all i can say is that i am tired what they do not know is that i am not physically tired but mentally exhausted my mind is constantly racing overthinking every word that leaf my tongue every move i make and every awkward gesture that display itself during conversation with people i need a rest,Depression
8450,I am in a place in life where I feel so numb. So tired of my toxic mother. Stupid bitch. And this constant changing of day to night and night to day. I always feel like crying inside screaming. A few weeks ago I stopped my medications due to weight gain. I am not that much obese but It feels very uncomfortable gaining weight. Doctor told me to do exercises along with the medications. But I could not follow the word. I feel so empty. Confused and irritated about people and society. But I just want to feel loving someone. Live in the fantasy of love without the knowledge of love is a fake thing. Like I did years ago. Man or woman. Completely platonically. I just want to leave home. I watch yt videos of people going to jungle and survive. It gives me excitement. But I know I cannot just stand up and walk into the jungle. I do not know what I am trying to tell here. I am just typing my feelings rn. I would not post this maybe. maybe I will post this. If I decided to post this at the end it would not be from my original account because I think someone I know may identify me somehow. I just do not know what I am expecting from you by doing this. I just need to feel calm. I have this dire feeling of leaving society. For good. I just want to go far away. I feel like I cannot trust anyone in the world. In my fantasies I would like to meet a persona man or a woman who thinks and feels just like me. Hug himher and cry until I do not have tears anymore. But I know it is just fantasy. do not know what I really want. My brain is battling over multiple thoughts at the same time. For short periods of time I feel happiness. For short periods of time I believe in real intimate human connections. Until very immediately I realize it is just fucking fake. I do not want to die. I think I am not suicidal. Onetime in life many years ago I decided to die but I could not complete it right at the point. I was afraid of sth. I had hope that things can change over time. But so far it did not. Actually I think that if things have gotten worse. I wish things change soon for better. Because it is just painful now. This feeling is intolerable. Suffocating. I do not know how others do it. the 'normal people'. I cannot put together words to describe my feelings correctly. I am confused. I feel brain fogged. I want to go to the jungle...,Depression
24285,Hey all I have been diagnosed with depression for over 5 years now after a suicide attempt I made when I was just 13. I also struggle with anxiety and DPDR. I am just making this post to write down some of my feelings about depression. do not fall in love with your depression. Depression does not give you anything. It does not give you empathy or a cool aesthetic or teach you anything. Depression only takes from you. It takes up your time and energy leaving you feeling tired and defeated day after day. Depression is not your friend its more akin to a cancer that is stuck on your body that is slowly killing you each day. I know its easy to fall in love with depression. After all proximity creates love. Its convenient. With so many people coming and going from our life its easy to assume that something is worth loving if it sticks around long enough. But do not fall in love with what hurts you. do not even become friends with it. When you pass by it on the street do not even look it in the eye. do not fall in love with what kills you every day. do not fall in love with your depression,Depression
9724, So I was playing a Team Fortress 2 map on casual I have been playing this game for about 5 years and I still suck at the game at times and sometimes do to my family's internet and my crappy intel laptop I would lag. I saw videos of people telling their problems on here so I thought I should give it a try. I am a 17 year old guy doing my last year of high school I have autism and I prefer to be treated like a normal person and to get not pity for having autism. But what happened was that this guy who ill keep anonymous. He was saying I was bad and just being harsh about it giving me nothing but destructive criticism. ampx200B I use this game as a coping mechanism and it works a lot. I just need some support and motivation right now and would appreciate not looking this guy up because I already reported him for abusing the in game kick system and harassment. I played Team Fortress 2 amp met a harsh guy.,Depression
23895,Still live with my parents still a minor yeah. Not for long though wish I could cherish my youth for what its worth since I never really got to get out of the house much or have anything closely resembling a healthy functioning friendship. Just overcontrolling and overbearing parents with shit abusive colleagues. Parents left for a business trip 'bout a week. Two days ago was melding over my dwindling sanity and the increasing gaps in my memory. I cannot remember shit about any traumatic events I may or may not have had in the past so it is quite depressing to think that maybe they just never happened in the first place. I have no real reason to be depressed so it is quite likely that I am just doing all of this for the attention. At least that is what I have been told. Cracked out alcohol since I cannot cry. have not been able to cry for a very long while. Parents used to beat me for crying colleagues used to beat me as well. School when I was younger was shit used to get beaten up a lot. Broke my nose twice a few other bones in my body. Belittled and broken down so fucking much it bled straight through to the point where I had a decent sized portion of my adolescence where I was obsessed with the idea of transitioning to abandon my entire previous personality and set of memories since I could not cope with them anymore. Still fucks me over to this day and although I might have found a balance for a softer guy type personality it still does not play well at times. Right sidetracking. Alcohol. Thought it might help me unbottle some emotion to the point where it overflowed and I might cry again. have not eaten anything proper for months now usually just half a meal a day Think a sandwich maybe two on a good day so the alcohol kicked in really quickly. Sisters were going to be back so I counteracted with around 78 espressos in a large mug. Looking back that was probably a bad idea. I never got around to crying. Instead sitting on bathroom tile for hours on end I just took more and more aspirin with ibuprofen to get around to finally biting the dust. I have been trying for years now it just never really worked out since the probability of a proper death and not just ohgreatifuckingsurvivedandnowmyparentsaregoing toshipmetoamonastary type lifestyle but then I just could not give less of a fuck. Necked down 67 aspirin and 25 ibuprofen when a really bad habit kicked in. I tend to cut myself. Right around my thigh so that it is easier to hide. Usually I just cut once twice never revisiting the same wound but goddamn this time I was persistent. Cut the same area multiple times till I hit the femoral artery. Alcohol ib aspirin and caffeine make for one hell of a whack combo and then I was bleeding out to death as well. Over the course of the next few hours I proceeded to loose a lot of blood. Funny how the only time I am ever smart and live up to the expectations others have of me is when I am trying to kill myself. I have no idea how much but I had a really fucking bad fever tremors and a few others but I have no idea what happened after I got in bed. Bled through the damn mattress and the only thing that saved my life was a belt and some salt. Strapped it so tightly around my leg I have no idea why I stopped the bleeding I do not remember 80 of the shit that happened two days ago as usual but the thing that was the scariest was the relentless sense of loneliness. it is why I am here now two days later. Alone in a dark room desperately calling every number in the contact book to see if someone will pick up someone to save me from the same nightmare but no one is there. I am all alone. I know I deserve it but it is still scary. After all this time years on end of loneliness I still cannot get over it. I would say I am a kid at heart but after the things I have done in the past the guilt just will not let go. All I know is that life is fucking scary man. I apologize for the megacondensed version of this. Yes this is on a new account I do not want people in my personal life knowing what the fuck is going on. If I managed to do one thing right it was hide this whole fucked incident from my sisters and brotherinlaw without them guessing what the fuck was going on. I did not touch on some of the finer stuff but I suppose that is to be clarified later. I also know there is a decent chance this will get removed to which I tell the moderators that it is pretty understandable. Whatever happens typing this out helped me a little at least.

9888,What can we say about the Unresponsive? Do they leave us in the dirt because they have no answers? Do they leave us in the dirt because they are not capable of grasping what we are experiencing? Or are we turning their life upside down because we CHOOSE to explain to them what we are experiencing? Ghosting is the easiest thing to do when you want to avoid responsibility. So what does that say about our counterparts.. the one's we vent to and supposedly trust but leave us in the dust.. What does that say about them.. they would rather experience ignorance than the truth. Our example leaves them renderless to what life is actually all about. it is easier to live your normal pathetic slave ridden life than it is to recognize that someone you care about is suffering and there is nothing they can do about it.. and that is why they ghost us.. not because they do not care.. but because they are inadequate they are not the one's to solve our problems we are. The sooner we take responsibility for our depression and loneliness and even suicidal ideation who can we trust but ourselves? How many times are you going to have to get hurt until you realize its just you you experiencing it all. All outside conversation is speculation. THE UNRESPONSIVE,Depression

I have always been confident I would never kill myself because of how it would affect my family members but as the perspective of my situation has gotten more clear due to the stress of university I have borderline fantasized over it I have known for years now on what I need to do to improve my situation but never had the discipline to stick with my attempts. honestly I know realistically I will never amount to anything or start a family and feel worse as time goes on being a fuck up at 18 is fine you can fix it and have a good youth and future fuck up at 30 I presume is soul destroying let alone being alone at 50. Rambled a bit but is it normal or concerning to have thoughts involving suicide even if you do not think you will do it? Are these thoughts that can escalate? Is it normal to have thoughts of suicide when your life is a mess even if you think you would not do it?,Depression
19663,I remember all the most painful moments. it is eating me away.I feel like I was halfwild as a child and on top of that I had to endure life full of embarrassment.Existence is a curse. I hate it here. I cannot stop cringing at my past,Depression
47888,Im embarrassed to say this but I need help Im 19 and turning 20 in may I have tried living a normal life with a full time job but that doesnt help. Ive also tried therapy and have been taking 200 mg of Sertraline for about a year and a half now and that barely helps me. I want to pass away but I have anxiety so Im afraid of the pain that might come with it. Im stuck in what seems like and endless circle of hating life but being terrified to end it. I need help,Depression
10812,I am 24 now and maybe it was my dysfunctional family my upbringing my environment. I have always been shy introverted and never really talk to people. I had good friends as a child but into high school I did not have anyone. people are fake users deceiving. I did not understand how relationships happened how people date. what is this love teachers give to their students. kids going out to parties but I could not fit in kids have friend groups and do stupid funny things i could not have. I thought I had a friend group in college and this girl messed it all up because she had caught feelings for her exes best friend and then because he was not giving it to her she slept with his other friend and thus the whole group split. I understand her feelings I want to experience a relationship but this whole society seems messed up. I cannot even deal with the long distance relationships. I need something here and now in the moment. I wish I could just forget it all and just have the motivation to be the person I want to be be good at learning languages producing music web design graphic design film editing photography hitting the gym doing stocks and finance like there are just so many things I could do for myself but I do not have the motivation at all. even in my current job I get so bored quickly reading all these white papers I want to get out and be proactive. I have always felt like life is never the way I want it to be.,Depression
15633,I do not know why my brain does this but I cannot even do anything for enjoyment anymore because everytime I try to do something for fun my brain thinks way too much about it and it stresses me out and saps the fun out of everything. I think about which game would bring me more enjoyment which song would bring me more emotion which activity I really want to do and I never know man. I am stressed out by everything that I used to do for fun. I cannot make up my mind about anything anymore. it is so hard I just want to feel better but I feel bad for no reason all about everything why. Overthinking has taken all enjoyment out of everything...,Depression
26015,I cannot feel anything since 2016 and it is getting worse and worse. Over the years I lost the little joy I had in life then I would not be sad or angry anymore. It feels like I am an empty she will that is just there if people need something and I happen to be around.I am thinking about to kill myself every 2nd day but the only thing that is holding me back is that my brother would be devastated and I could not do it.I tried to get help but every therapist I try to get in contact with says that they are full and I should try it somewhere else. I am just sharing this to get it of my chest I do not have any friends to talk about this and and nobody in my family is listening to me.And BTW sorry for my bad English. I am 20m and I am do sick an tired of everything,Depression
23708,Pls i need help. I cannot take it no more Counseling,Depression
11368,Like the title says only 25 should be in the prime of my life my brain feels like it is about 50 already though. Used to be so smart as a kid and now I feel like between the drugs and the alcohol I can never reach my full potential. My memory is starting to go already and I truly do not get any enjoyment out of anything anymore. I have a good job probably with the most desired company in my field in my city. Beautiful woman who loves me and still do not feel fulfilled. Feel like every single day is just going through the motions because it is what I should do. Still think of suicide literally every day but just power through and try to ignore it and not let anyone know. Feel like I am only 25 and ruined my mind already.,Depression

15198,Throwaway account. I feel ashamed of myself for failing at school.. for failing at every attempt I tried to become successful.. I am ashamed of myself.I am ashamed of myself.I am ashamed of myself.I am ashamed of myself.I am ashamed of myself.I am ashamed of myself.I am ashamed of myself. I feel I have put my family behind... I could have given my daughter better things by now if I did not fuck it all up... and I keep fucking things up as I try to make things better. I should have just stayed home a few more extra hours when my appendix raptured and my death could have been excused but now I have to live with feeling of wanting to die but cannot do it because I would ruin other peoples life... I am such a loner.. I am thankful for my wife. my sister. my mom. my daughter. that is it. I got no one else. have not had a conversation that matters with anyone else in over 10 years. I come off as a weirdo. I guess things could be worst but they could have certainly been better if it was not for my stupid ass. Feeling the pressure,Depression
14195,I have had a lot of trouble transferring my antidepressants from my old pharmacy to my new one in a new state. I started this process when i still had 34 days left of my medication insurance will not cover a refill before then and at this point I have been out for a week. Old symptoms are starting to come back. Intrusive thoughts are taking up a lot of my time today. I am tearing up at the drop of a dime. My productivity is slipping. I am easily overwhelmed. I do not have a new therapist out here yet either which is making this harder. I cannot stand this I had almost forgotten what this all felt like its been almost months since these symptoms have affected me. I am worried I will start going through the really bad symptoms of withdrawal from being forced to coldturkey stop my medications and I feel like the pharmacists are sick of hearing from me and I have stopped being polite to the hospital employees who have majorly fucked this up for example they sent my medication to a completely different pharmacy over an hour away from me 2 days ago for processing simply because it was the same company as my old pharmacy even though I put my new pharmacy's information in the system last week. I am not ok I needed to vent I am trying my hardest to cope but holy FUCK this sucks. I have been out of my medication for about a week now and old symptoms are starting to come back.,Depression

14925,Feeling sad feeling like life is not worth it. I love my girlfriend with all my heart and we had a nice laugh together. I just feel like what is the point in living if we only live to work and work to live. I will not end up leaving a mark on the work. Sometimes I genuinely think about just jumping in the car at 70100 mph and just swerving and then it is all over. I have taken multiple pills on different days just to numb the pain of feeling worthless but it still does not work. One time after taking too many pills I felt a shooting pain in my abdomen that I felt both scared and glad. Scared because I thought something was happening and glad because it is kind of what I wanted. I dunno what to do to stop me feeling so empty. I could put on my happy face where I am the jokester both at home and work but my change in mood has been noticed at work. People ask me how I am and i just say I am fine I will be okay. I do not feel like I really have a valid reason to be sad. Its just how I feel. I have went from telling lots of jokes to being a depressed idiot. Part of me is wondering why I am even typing this. I do not want to leave this world because I care about my girlfriend and I love her so much. she is been through soo much already and does not need to know what I am going through as I feel like it will only bring her down. I want her to feel special. she is lost soo much family already I could not bare to bring any bad news upon her. Its probably not even bad news. I just feel a little sad and sometimes just want to zone out and not exist for days at a time do not know why I am sharing this just how I have felt over that past while,Depression
11893,I just found this community and I am just curious as to how does depression feel. Sometimes my feelings are really really strong and i feel like i cannot control them my mind gets filled with negative stuff but I have always tried to see the positive side of everything. I rly do not think I have any reason to be sad or depressed I really am happy with my life and the people I love surrounding me.But sometimes out of nowhere without reason or for really insignificant stuff I suddenly feel lonely like no one cares about me deep down I know that is not true but idk why it keeps getting to me every now and then. I am an overthinker and I have tried to change that for me and the people i love bc it has brought me problems all my life this past year i have calmed my anxiety and the way I worry about stuff I am feeling a lot better. But something I have never told anyone in my life is how these negative thoughts come to me sometimes as if I am not worthy or just do not deserve to be here. it is weird I just feel like no one would understand idk if it is actually depression or just random normal sad thoughts. But I do not want to tell anyone I care about bc I think it would worry them and that I would destroy what i have with the people I love that they would think I am crazy or something and leave me that they will get tired of me. i just try to ignore my bad feelings and see the positive side realizing that my reasons to be sad are not valid but it is hard and i do not think i have depression but sometimes it comes to my mind that maybe i have and do not want to admit it? Idk I just do not want ppl to change their view of me or how they treat me or make them feel guilty for what I feel randomly but idk if that is just making me close off make a barrier with everyone instead of facing what my heart feels... So ye I just feel stupid because i do actually have everything to be happy and I truly am i am not insecure of myself either I am happy with everyone that is with me right now well my friends let me down a lot but apart from that it is all good my family my bf and the few friends I trust. But doubts suddenly invade my mind and do not let me see stuff as great as it actually is. So ye idk what to call this or how to overcome it sometimes. it is not always but when it happens it really puts me down in a fking hole. What does depression feel like?,Depression
39788,i ve tried i ve put in effort i ve fought back and i did get better before it all went downhill again til i m back to square one then still i got told to try and put in more effort to fight back a if that wasn t what i have been doing to get this far to survive this far no matter how much effort i put in the end everything came back to nothing it s all meaningless they would only see the result without acknowledging nor appreciating the effort i m too tired to fight anymore i don t have anyone to talk to about my problem more like i don t have anyone that i trust enough for me to really open up to even the friend i got right now i can t feel a strong connection with them i don t even talk much with them also too scared to even talk to a therapist and seek help having to reveal my problem like that make me feel vulnerable miserable and embarrassing another reason for not seeking help is so i can break down even more until i really lose my mind and there d really be nothing better than dying i guess but mainly i hate the idea of having to reveal myself to others a i ve mentioned just before this i ve grown too tired i ve been spending a lot more time in my room playing game and barely doing anything productive outside of my work i don t have any motivation or dream sometimes i fear having to sleep at night because by the time i wake up i d have to go through another dull day again and repeat the same thing over and over again the problem is in me i can t run away from myself i wish i could just disappear from existence and it d be nice if no one would remember me at all i m going to sleep and i hope i won t wake up to greet another day but i know that ain t gon na happen will delete this post later i don t really like posting a rant like this too but i really needed to get it out a bit please don t mind this post at all and have a good day to whoever ha read this til the end,Depression

I do not process things like I use too. .,Depression

Even when I tried to defend myself I was beaten up. No one liked my isolation I did not know what I did wrongWas it my looks was it my attitude was it the way I spoke what was it? Most of my questions 10th Grade First friend 'L' second friend 'S' third friend 'Sh'... do not remember the other 2They were nice they treated me as a friend but deep down I knew they were going to find something to hurt me I knew it! They did not.Every conversation changed me I was happier.I met my first Love. I fall in love easily and all girls were somewhat nice but she... She was not perfect! For the first time I liked a girl that did not look great! She was... She was not ordinary! I felt like I was talking to someone who was real someone who I thought was perfect my other half the one who I cannot be...After getting to know her for a while... Did I start to slowly feel that maybe now was the time to ask her out? No I stopped. For a while I stopped... For a full year I tried to get to know her but I could not! Dammit!I got to know her through texts and... and I found out who she was the resonance I felt it was not just surface level she had her own issues too and I felt like I could relate to herI asked her out and then! AND THEN I FUCKING FAILED! HAHAHA I got so angry wow. I insulted her so fucking badly I thought I was the definition of insult... I... I do not know if it was depression or my stupidity at the time... It... It felt right! I started loving destruction!Expectations? Destroy them!Families?

47340,I'm not sure what to do anymore I feel like everything is coming to an end around me. I feel like I'm rotting from the inside out and there's nothing I can do about it. I feel scared and alone I'm terrified those around me will abandon me or forget about me but I'm too scared to reach out to them. my parents have been trying to contact me for days but I can't stomach the thought of talking to anyone right now but I don't want them to worry about me. I just don't really know what to do right now.,Depression
15478,I feel lonely like nobody cares everyone is just lying to me telling me that they do. People have done that to me before. I had friends in my past who I thought were my friends they called me asked me to hang out. They just basically laughed at me the things I said the things I do made fun of the girl I was with at the time. Then one of them told me later. They just called you because they wanted to make fun of you but do not tell them I told you I played it off like it did not matter. that is when I truly knew I cannot trust anybody. I am not meant to have anybody who I can be truly close too. that is when I decided to end my life I failed of course I cannot even do that. Sometimes I ignore my feelings I hide I do not go out I pretend that they are not there. Then I figure there gone. As soon as I start to go out n have fun it all comes back everything. I do not know what to do. I am lost I cannot even put into words how I feel right now This is the reason why I cannot trust people,Depression
39068,posting because this medication ha had an incredible impact for me in a very short time and i think that s worth sharing in case it can help anyone else who suffers from anxiety i wa prescribed propranolol 0mg xr per day a little over one week ago primarily for enhanced physiologic tremor my doctor did also suspect that it would help with some physical symptom of anxiety that i have including elevated hr general muscle tension flushing shortness of breath my anxiety had become so bad over the last year that i have essentially become unable to rock climb which wa previously my favorite activity and stress reliever due to extreme fear shaking freezing up and compulsive checking of equipment well i don t want to get too excited in case thing change a my body acclimates to the drug but so far it really feel like this medication ha changed my life i honestly am starting to feel like myself again in so many way the tension in my shoulder and muscle that ha just become standard for me in the day to day ha been released my tremor is significantly reduced i feel like a weight ha been lifted off of my body i have rock climbed a couple of time since i started the medication and the excessive fear response is all but eliminated no more shaking no more locking up it s pretty amazing i can t even begin to express how huge of a deal this is i wa not expecting this at all i had no idea that this med would have such a significant impact on my anxiety i expected a reduced tremor and hr but nothing more i know that this med ha no impact on the actual mental process but my symptom of anxiety have always been primarily physical it seems a though reducing the tension and heart rate and shaking ha allowed everything else to relax a well i am sure not everyone will have the same experience and who know it could change for me with time but for the time being this med ha been a game changer for me so far i have had no negative side effect not even low bp which i have always had issue with my regular bp is often 9 0 and this med doesn t appear to have changed that in any way despite reducing my hr,Depression

I am not even past my teen years yet and i still feel like a trashy and useless person. i want to be like other people. i want to be smart and charismatic memorable but no. I am just going to be another random dude who had big ambitions that went nowhere. I am still confused as to why people see me as a good smart person when I am not at all. i just want to be important to the world. the only think keeping me here is that one special person who cares about me otherwise i would have been gone already. i feel like a failure.,Depression

10242,Today is the death anniversary for my nephew. We lost him to a tragic drowning accident 9 years ago. He was two when he passed away and I was the only one in my family that ever got to meet him and be with him. I helped my sister raise him for the first few months of his life. it is hits me soo hard every single year. It never gets easy. Usually around this fine I have mt bestest friend that I have known since I was 18 would be here to talk with me and keep mt head sane. Sadly it is been 2 year on the 20th that I also lost her to a tragic health condition that stole her away. Last year I ended up coming off the deep end being the first year I did not have her to be the ground I needed. This year does not feel much different. All I want to do is see his face again and hear her voice. I do not want to break down I do not want this year to be like every other year but I already have not slept in days. All I can think about is all the people I have lost and how I need them now more than ever. I just want them back. This is the week I struggle the most.,Depression

25729,I picked up my pen and finally forced myself to do it. It feels so damn good seeing it stitched together and fall in the right places.

21198,I turn 21 next week Male. Most of my life is pretty good.I am apart of a loving familyI am very confident and content with the person I am. I get along with people well including my family. I am also happy with the path I am on in life Well At least most of the timeAbout once a year since I was 14 for a few weeks typically around my birthday. I get pretty intense anxiety about my age.This leads me to a depressive episode and a full blown existential crisis. I start obsessing and fearing over my age the future and the past. I constantly look around and think about everyone elses age. I loose all interest in my goals and hobbies. As everything starts to become trivial. I get near a panic attack anytime I think of my current age or my age next year. After a few weeks I tend to go back to normal but it always comes back and there is always a little bit of it occasionally popping up in my mind.I am afraid as I get older It will only get more intense Again most of the time I do not feel this way and sometimes I feel really excited for the future. But This annual bout of depressionanxiety can really take a toll on me and my comfort with going forward in life. No one else I know seems to have these same feelings no matter what age they are they seem to be just carelessly going about life they might mention something occasionally like wow time flies or something but they do not seem to have the same crippling obsessive fear of the passage of time. Does anyone else have similar feelings and possibly grow out of it? Or find some sort of peace with the universe? Thanks much love and best wishes to everyone. DepressionAnxiety over age.,Depression

14631,i show up to work everyday because my coworkers need me to be there. i only clean my apartment if someone is coming over. i only eat normally when I am going out with friends or if a friend is staying with me. i have so many things that i want to do for myself but i literally cannot get myself out of bed. i stay in bed for hours even when I am hungry. the thought of cooking or even getting up to microwave something is too much.i moved into a new place over 3 months ago and there are about three small boxes i still have not fully unpacked because the thought of opening them and having to place the contents somewhere is just exhausting. if i open the boxes i have to move the items inside but in order to move the items somewhere else i have to make sure the area i want to put them is clean and has space for them and if it does not then i have to organize that area first and the cycle repeats itself. I have wanted to do this every day for months but every time i think about it its as if my head becomes so heavy i cannot physically bring myself to move. I have tried doing it in smaller chunks or even just taking the stuff out of the boxes but i always end up losing motivation halfway through. i have one summer class left that i need to take in order to graduate college. i have not kept up with the content. i have not been doing my 1 weekly homework assignment for the last two weeks because it seems pointless although i know logically its not. i was able to do my midterm essay for the class a few hours before it was due but that is only because its worth 40 of my grade and the time crunch finally pushed me to do it. i used to care so much about my grades but now that i only have one class left i cannot even get over this enough to do what i need to do to pass it. my therapist does not understand these issues when i explain them to her because instead of asking for help most of the time i act happy and like I am getting better during our sessions. every time i do try to let her know what is happening she unintentionally downplays it because she does not understand what i mean. I have told her that i have issues with motivation and i know she is trying to help but she just sent me links to videos with motivational speeches and it does nothing. i do not know what i need but i do know its not that. if eating being happy with my own space at home and possibly not graduating college is not enough motivation for me to do my stuff then some random words of encouragement will not do anything for me. despite wanting to do all these things and make these changes i KNOW will make me happier and feel a little better nothing so far has motivated me to do so. i feel trapped with my thoughts moving a thousand miles a minute while my body keeps me laying down. my head stays glued to the pillow. i cannot keep existing like this but i do not know where else to find motivation from when i want to do things for my own sake. i can only do things if people are counting on me to do them.,Depression

I am seeing doctor very often. Still no cure.i work in IT and my employet is an asshole. I just want to wake up every day and do nothing. I wish I were rich so that I could be depressed with peace.

17743,I have been in a depressive haze for like a year. Smoking too much pot every single day is not a great idea! I had a family member get cancer around the beginning of COVID and it kind of broke me. I was going to therapy and taking meds for a while but neither of those are happening anymore. I have isolated myself from my old friends for so long. I do not even know if they would want to hear from me. I live with my parents I am unemployed I have let my bedroom become a huge mess and now I am 99 sure there is a cockroach nest under my bed. I cannot believe I let it get this bad. I am so ashamed. it is Tremendously Bad!,Depression
25917,I am 20 going into 3rd year computer science student and I have no clue what to do with myself I have no goals no motivation for anything. All day I just play video games not really enjoying myself just wasting time and then I rinse and repeat everyday. I have never had much motivation towards anything always scraping through life and I think the biggest problem is that I am very competitive and I always think I know I cannot be the best at ... therefore why should I even try? If you can never be the very best at something why try?,Depression

10581,I have had a funny feeling lately. Kind of unusual. Its like I woke up from a nap kind of late after a long day of work.When I awoke it was already dark and suddenly my dark apartment felt extremely dark. And the Normal solitude I am accustomed to became so intolerable. It almost felt like a panic attack in a way.Yet my heart was not racing. Yet I felt on edge and so so very alone.I busied myself with some quick chores. Suddenly a friend of mine messaged and I messaged them back quickly. They even called and its like I was so thrilled to talk with them for awhile and the feeling began to fade.I just do not understand it well.I have lived alone for several years nowand I am accustomed to it even prefer it at times.And yet waking up suddenly this evening the feeling of being alone felt like a prison. Completely intolerable.I was curious if anyone has ever felt anything like that. I know I have been a bit depressed latelyIm wondering if some of my anxiety symptoms are returning perhaps in a different way. Anxiety and depression about solitude?,Depression
14451,I am turning 20 next month and I am so freakin done. What is the point of life??!! Its hard if you are not rich. People say money does not matter family does btch my family is fucked up. Its hard for me to see a future for myself. HOW TF AN I GOING TO GET THERE?!!! How. It seems so unrealistic. I quit my job recently I am not in school I only half ass my hobbies so its not even accomplishing enough to feel worthy of living. The only reason I am still here is because I still have money saved up and if I die no one would take care of my dog. And my dog do not even like me unless I have food.Ik it sounds like I am taking this lightly and Half hearted but in reality I just bawled my eyes out. I have failed so many people by ghosting people who gave me successful job opportunities because I was too anxious to even take the opportunity. I ghosted my doctor bc I felt like he did not care enough about my mental health. I feel as though he tired of me going on and off about antidepressants and ghosting therapist that he sent recommendations to. I am a fucking asshole I guess.I am also a shit daughter and have no respect for my parents. I could sit here and justify why its a shit relationship but I am too lazy and story goes its bc I had a shit emotionally neglected childhood D I have no boundariesConstantly being manipulated and gaslighted at homeIm made fun ofLol I am just tired.I wish I had a reset button that went back to grade 4. Before my life changed Please. Does. It. Get. Better. Please..,Depression

9769,If everyone could treat each other like actual living souls and not use other people as a way to get something they want if people cared more about someone is progress and who they are today and not gaslight them from who they were this whole worlds system would fall apart and we could all have a new society not a perfect one but one where we take peoples emotions seriously and get to know peoples hearts sorry for horrible grammar but I need to rant Life does not have to be like this,Depression
16166,I do not really know how to start this. Lately my self hatred has popped up again. The shadow that has always loomed in my corner was just waiting. I think it is funny really. It waited for a time to strike to absolutely demolish my months and months of therapy. I guess it just to decided to say fuck you. This feeling really takes its toll on me. This fake mask I wear is finally peeling off. The glue keeping everything together has finally started to disintegrate. My motivation to keep working has been decreasing dramatically. Spacing out and thinking about the cold void that is looming near me. I can see it. Just waiting.Why does the void look so comfortable. She has called to me so many times. Asked me to dance with her. Even though I tell her every time it is not my time. She stands there waiting with the Bouquet of Black Roses. I know one day. One day it will be a struggle to not accept that bouquet.Sorry everyone. Going through some shit at the moment. Self Hate,Depression
11700,i have my own share of depressive episodes periodically and somedays like right now I fight every single day to keep it at bay. my best friend is going through a terrible depressive episode and honestly I have forgotten how to even be there someone. i just have lost so many parts of me I do not know anymore. everyone anyone reading this please tell me what really helps? how can I be there for them? it hurts to see them hurting but I do not know what to do. what works for you as people who hurt too? how do you help? I know it is different for everyone but i just want to feel like I can be there for someone or at least try. how to be there for someone?,Depression
14278,I hate myself so much.I keep trying things... I keep trying to meet people but I just cannot find anyone I have anything in common with.ampx200BThe answer the proper human answer is to change myself to fit everyone else. I cannot do that. I just cannot lie to myself. Maybe it is because I am autistic.I am 30 years old and no one has ever seen me sexually. I feel like everyone I have known would laugh at the idea or anyone ever being in love with me. I have... also never met anyone I have been attracted to. But like. I mean yeah I have high standards but if I myself live up my standards why is it wrong for me to want to spend time with someone else who works as hard as I do towards the same standardsvalues?ampx200BBut I feel like no one will ever accept me because I am a virgin. Because I care about sexpositivity and LGBTetc things and things like that I am pansexual but I feel like I would not be seen as legitimate that I would just be laughed out of the room and trashed because I have never actually been with anyone.ampx200BJust... having no friends is the same as missing an essential nutrient. You just cannot function. No amount of pushing yourself to get over it is going to make up for that. ampx200BAnd I am at my limit.ampx200BI just want to be seen. I just want to be acknowledged as a person. I want to exist. I want to actually exist. I feel like I do not exist because no one notices me. ampx200BJust... being 100 ignored... it hurts. I just need friends.ampx200BIf I died today no one would even know. Like. There literally is not a single person anywhere who would miss me. I am just never going to have any friends or personal connections with other people,Depression

9444,And I never know when a bad day is coming! I could be having a great week and suddenly it all just hits me. I then have no motivation to do anything constantly tired see no meaning in living just want to stare at a wall while on the verge of tears. Here is where I am at the moment. I have not seeked help since its not always like this. Some days I am feeling great but there is no balance in my life. And I do not know what to do about it. I have tried journaling exercise meditation and that kind of stuff but it is not helping! Some days are great others suck,Depression
23955,I am only happy when I am asleep. Not much going for me in life.. wasted potential. I am.supposed to be starting my life over right now but seems like the only jobs I would qualify for are barely livable. Any words of advice on how to make something of myself before I just throw in the towel? I have really had enough of this. Not enough sleep,Depression
18833,I had such positive momentum going for weeks. I was hitting the gym eating better and just felt more positive in general. Then I got two bad nights of sleep and I just feel more miserable than ever. Its so frustrating that my mental wellbeing is so fragile and fickle. I was borderline suicidal after the 2nd night of bad sleep yesterday. Feeling a little better today but still just no motivation to work or do anything but lay in bed. Couple bad nights of sleep and all I feel is despair now,Depression
8037,I identify myself as introvert. Since I have been exposed to internet from year 2016 I have always found comfort in reading about Psychology. I am fascinated by MBTI Big 5 Models Jungian Typology and all the things along the lines. I have focused very much on self improvement and tried to improve my skills. I figured out atleast acting like an extrovert tends to make social life a hell lot easier. But whenever I try to do this I just do not feel like myself. I kind of become numb among people which I only realise when I let myself speak to me often at night when alone. I think forcing myself to socialise and talking to friends is kind of helping in building my social persona but I just live by a philosophy that everyone is just alone in his life and as long as I do not fall into making myself vulnerable in front of people I am fine. I just do not want anyone to know the real me. And I guess the reason for that is because I have experienced and now firmly believe too that no one can ever understand me fully. I have tried explaining myself to people but I feel every friendfamily I ever had just waited for their turn to speak if I ever talk about myself. Anyways the question is I am confused what part is me ?Should I keep myself happy and just keep living in my head and stop interacting to other humans. Because I literally just love living by myself. Or I should keep trying to socialise because I also believe that if I want to earn even a small amount of money I need to just develop my social game. Keep in mind every other human being including my family is just a person to me whom I can just never reveal my true self talking about things I want because whenever I have done it in my life people just go blank like it is a huge lot complex for them even to comprehend and believe me I have tried this way many times than you can imagine. Losing the definition of myself,Depression

21057,Whoever is reading this I am sorry if I made this decision. I just do not want to live anymore. I do not want to disappoint people. I hate myself I am not worthy of love.After long consideration I decided to kill myself. I do not want to live anymore. I am hideous disgusting worthless. My existence is pointless amp meaningless. Nobody would love me. My face is disgusting. My skin is full of scars. How can anyone in the right mind love me? I am nothing.it is hard to live everyday hating yourself. Battling thoughts in your mind. And the voices in your head telling you how worthless you are.Every inch of my skin is disgusting. Every time I look at myself in the mirror I see nothing but a hideous monster.I am tired. I am done. And I have had enough. I just want to end everything. For my friends amp family I might be selfish for doing this but I am just tired.I hope you guys understand. The world is depressing. I failed the world. I failed everyone. I just do not want to live anymore. Love you all. A suicide note that I will use in the future,Depression
10319,i feel like there is more than one of me. in me. how the fuck do i say this alright alright. there is the first one which is pretty much just me. the one that talks the one that thinks the one that is writing this. the main one i guess. then there is the second one. the one that tells me to shut the fuck up whenever i say something. the one that insults me every time i do something. the one that digs my fingernails into my palm whenever i annoy him. the one that hates me. he is also the one that calms me down if i get too angry. the one that just tells me to take deep breaths if I am shaking. he yells at me but if i yell at myself he will calm me down. i have literal conversations with him. with myself. with the fucking mirror. i do not know why. i do not know if it is just normal or if I am fucked in the head. i do not have multiple personality disorder probably I am almost sure i do not. i have no idea what is going on with me. i do not know what is wrong with me if anything,Depression
9803,The way I see it I do not owe anyone anything. I did not ask to be born. If given the choice I would have said no to being conceived.

8193,I put in my notice last week at the place I was working at. My last day was supposed to be Friday but they let me go today. I was a temp so there is nothing I can do or say. I was leaving because they had told me things would change and nothing did in the two and a half months I was there.I have another job lined up. I start on Monday. But I had financially planned on working 40 hours this week. I came back from a medical leave last week. I just feel like shit. I am worried things will not work out at the place I am going to. What if there are more lies there! What if my new manager ends up hating me? What if its really stressful there as well? I had applied to a lot of jobs and did quite a few interviews. This new place is not bad but its not what I really wanted. There was one company I so wanted to work for but they turned me down last Monday. I am still sad about that for some reason.I hate how I am. Too intelligent to enjoy dumb things but not smart enough to hang with intellectuals. Too mentally ill to keep a job long term and have a career but not mentally ill enough to get on SSI or even get into a comprehensive therapy program. Its like I am never right. No matter how hard I try my life always feels like its one mistake away from crumbling. I just want to stop being so damn sad. Left and Leaving,Depression
17699,Hi GuysFor the last year or so I have been slowly losing motivation to do anything of worth. I do not want to go to work I do not want to go to the gym and if I can I would remain in bed within a dark room and just be on my phone the entire day. I am addicted to it and the worst of all is that I have no ambition for change. There is a part of me that just wants to continue this lifestyle of staying in bed and a smaller part of me that just wishes that I can be motivated again. It also feels like I am becoming more and more unmotivated by the day and thus only digging myself deeper into the grips of an unmotivated mindset. I do not feel depressed or sad I just feel nothing. I do not care for anything and I do not even want to speak to people. The articles online do not help at ALL but my psychiatrist recommended that I start taking CymGen 60 but it makes me feel weird when I take it. Does anyone have any experience with this medication? Does it get better? After reading this entire post again I realize how pathetic I sound and I do apogize for that. I just do not know what to do and whom to turn to. All advice on how to get out of this deteriorating mindset will be appreciated. Thank you all and stay safe out there. My lack of motivation is going to destroy my life,Depression
40462,i can t do it anymore i don t want to talk to anyone because i keep backtracking myself into thinking i m over exaggerating i have no social skill constantly feel like everyone around me would be better off without me better yet everyone but my parent wouldn t notice they ll hurt the most and that s what i hate so much i wish i could just not wake up tomorrow and not feel like this again i m tired of everything school is shit i want to make them proud but i just cant,Depression
9994,I do not even know why I am awake. Why am I even trying? it is exhausting trying to gain the energy I need from food and exercise and work but ending up drained of it and starved for it anyway. I was having a slow day. Now it is turning into a bad day. I feel mocked by these customers. I feel disregarded by my coworkers. I feel attacked by the company that does not see me as a person just a robot that follows orders and works hard so they can pay me less. I feel I am losing my identity. I do not want to be me anymore because who cares? Who cares about who I am? What I like? What I want? I am tired...I am tired of trying. it is so hard to resist giving up. My depression is a loud voice that commands me to just throw in the towel and lose. To lose like the loser I am. Why try succeeding if you will only ever lose?...I am not enough. I am not alive. I am so tired. I just want to go home and sleep for a week... Saying I am tired when I am actually tired but then I start to feel depressed and now I am even more tired...while also feeling totally empty inside.,Depression
15433,This was 5 days ago now. He was not trying to be hurtful it was the result of a direct question geared towards him. A year ago he had shown interest in maybe us becoming more than friends but it was pretty clear that he changed his mind about it quickly. He started treating me differently talking down to me being short not controlling his temper and I started really feeling shitty about myself. I have a lot of codIm 29 going on 30 and I have a lot of issues. I have no contact with my family my dad died in a car accident and my grandmother of cancer. Both within a month of eachother. The rest of my family are assholes two of my closest friends stopped talking to me because of my mental health I am paying for an apartment I cannot afford and I graduated recently with a degree in art where tbh I am mediocre at best. Right now I am waiting tables and having to fake all of my emotions every fucking day and really sell that I care about someone is lunch taking too long. I feel like I cannot really make art or even enjoy making art because my depression has gotten so bad. Its been so hard to motivate and I feel like a fucking loser. I am barely sleeping. I work I go home I lay on the couch till the sun goes down. At this point I cannot even listen to music or watch tv anymore because the anxiety of feeling like a worthless pos kicks in so most of the time I just lay here and do nothing. I am really self conscious about where I am I feel stuck and I do not know how to get out of the hole I am in.I drink alone now. I did not even drink until about two years ago. Honestly I do not even really like alcohol that much it just makes the time go by and makes me not want to eat. I am uncomfortable in my body and have always wanted to be skinny and pretty and never have been either of those things.So I stupidly and drunkenly called him and asked what it was exactly that made him change his mind about me. He basically validated everything that I have been feeling that I have no drive no motivation and that I have just gotten comfortable. I do not know why I did it but I told him I had to go grabbed an xacto and cut my leg. I had to call out of work for two days because the wound was not really healing and I did not want to go to the hospital because I am uninsured and afraid of being put on a psychiatric hold. I already have so much fucking debt. I went to work today but it was really hard and I was in a lot of pain.I do not know what to do with myself. I think things are getting worse but I cannot afford the help I need and I feel so fucking alone. My best friend told me what he really thinks about me over the phone. I was drunk and not in a great headspace. I hung up and self harmed.,Depression
25966,i battled with severe low mood depression and intense feelings of anxiety for more than 10 years. i also had cases where i almost attempted. last time where i felt this severe was during the end of 2020. do not worry i do not get these feelings anymoreover the past 6 months my life changed for the better. i learned new coping mechanisms that were positive to keep me surviving. as well as mentally thinking positively rather than negatively. however my motivation and ability to do day to day tasks or work where i require to focus went down the drain. at first i thought it was my procrastination getting worse. however really my brain is fried. my attention span is non existent. i did not realise it was that bad till now over the summer holidays i go to uni where i now have free time to read or watch shows i find myself not focusing at all. i cannot even sit and watch it because i see no point? despite the fact i want to internally. it takes me a week to even respond to an email and that is only because it is severely important i have deadlines for coursework over the summer to complete which is important to me however i simply can not do it. i feel as though subconsciously i have still given up. it is awful that i now feel as though i am frozen and losing pace of reality. as though i froze in the same state of depression but without the severe emotional baggage that i once had. does anyone relate to this? and any help or advice would be great c i am frozen mentally and do not know where to go. my attention span is fried. and i am stuck in a depressive rut.,Depression

14976,really feel like my therapy is not working out. I am not sure if I am the one in the wrong and I am trying to look at it from all perspectives so please help me out. I have been with this therapist since february 2020 almost a year and a half. I am a minor and did not want to go to therapy but after being baker acted for a suicide attempt my parents forced me to start with this new therapist. i immediately told my parents i did not like her and i wanted to switch. they did not listen. in the past year and a half i have begged so many times and they refuse to let me switch. they say she has worked with hundreds of kids and is the best in the city. after a year and a half i am so so so much worse and while i do not at all blame her for that because that is mostly due to myself and my mental illness she has offered no help or support at all and has only made me feel worse. i have never felt like we clicked i feel like she does not understand what I am trying to say. i talk about myself and how i feel and she tells me i am wrong. ljke she is telling me how she thinks i feel instead of listening to me talk. she constantly gets mad at me for not trying hard enough even though i have repeatedly told her that it is hard for me. i struggle with social anxiety so it is hard for me to open up to strangers. she often asks me if there is anything i would like to talk about and then gets mad at me when i say no even though i have told her i am too anxious to bring my own subjects to talk about. i feel scared about saying the wrong things to her because of how she will react. if she deems that I am not trying hard enough she gets my parents involved and tells them to be very strict with me even though she knows that we do not have the best relationship and in the past it has only made things worse. i finish all my homework with maximum effort and she still complains that I am not trying. if she does not think I am trying she calls me spoiled and selfish because I am not using the resources I am given which i totally understand that I am very lucky to have parents that can afford and care enough to put me in therapy but being called spoiled and selfish for not trying even though i am just sends me into a downward spiral of self hatred and makes my depression so much worse. when i tell her about my suicidal thoughts she says I am just glamourizing glorifying death and that i think its cool. which is rlly invalidating because she is basically saying I am suicidal for attention and because i think its cool. and when i try to calmly explain that i do not at all think its cool but i feel so trapped that i do not see any other way out and I am in so much unbearable pain that i cannot survive anymore she tells me no i think you are just glamorizing it which upsets me further. she tells me to choose happiness which again i get where she is coming from because i know that choosing to have a positive mindset is important to beating depression but i tell her that its rlly hard for me because no matter how hard i try to be happy i end up even more miserable she tells me that its my fault for not trying hard enough and that if i wanted to be positive and happy i would. she constantly points out my flaws and not in a therapeutic way. like when she starts session she always says hey how are you and i said I am good how are you to be polite she says ugh that is not what you are supposed to say you have to tell me how your week was this is why i say you do not even try. if you keep this up I am going to have to tell your parents you are not trying. also the thing that is currently bothering me the most is her trying to discuss a disorder. now firstly when she brought it up she said i could reject the diagnosis nonverbal learning disorder. she told my mom and some teachers too to get multiple perspectives. everyone she talked to parents teachers etc said that it does not sound like me at all and i meet none of the criteria. i talked to her about it and said hey i really do not feel like i fit this at all but I am open to the diagnosis and would love to hear why you think i have this. if i have NVLD i would love to be diagnosed and get treatment but i do not want to be misdiagnosed especially because no one who knows me thinks i have the symptoms. so i tried to listen to her with an open mind but the things she said were complete bullshit. like she went over the symptoms list and just said completely false things like things that just never happened and refused to listen when i told her that is not what happened for example last november i was at rock bottom so suicidal and was failing out of school so my parents switched me to a small private school with ten kids in my grade. i was so so so angry at them. also on top of this the kids were actually insane on my first day there one of them lied about being in sandy hook and another followed me through the parking garage. anyways i was very angry and sad so instead of hanging out with the other kids during lunch break i went up to the pharmacy and bought bottles of pills so i could try to kill myself. i spent most of my lunch breaks loooking for ways or places to kill myself because my family was being very unsupportive and i was not allowed to see my friends and i was going through so much. anyways my therapist brought this up. and she said kids with NVLD often are loners or isolate themselves and are socially awkward. you going off on your own during lunch shows this behavior.l and i said i was literally trying to KILL MYSELF how are you going to use that as an example??! and she was like i think its fair to use that as evidence you have NVLD and all of her examples were like this!! and i was like there is literally no solid evidence and no one else who ACTUALLY KNOWS ME thinks i have this disorder its complete bullshit if you have real reasons fine but its not fair to use lies to make this claim instead of listening to me. i just feel like it would be way more helpful and productive if i could explain how my brain works and how i interpret things and she tells me if that aligns with NVLD. but when i try that she says yeah that does not seem like NVLD but i still think you have it. like when she asks me a question and i say i do not know because i do not like being put on the spot she says that that is not understanding broad concepts so i automatically have NVLD. its just so frustrating. i told her I have done so much research and watched so many videos about people talking about their experiences with NVLD and how it affects them and i relate to NONE OF IT and she does not listen. my mom has done the same thing and says she does not see how it relates to me because I am good at reading social cues knowing what to say am good at making friends grasp concepts well etc. it makes me really mad that she refuses to listen. she makes me feel so horrible about myself. every session with her makes me hate her and hate myself. I have begged my parents to quit and they will not let me. idk what to do. am i in the wrong therapy?,Depression

14554,i am an atheist and i am terrified of death because of two reasons eternal life and ceasing to exist. i have a fear of eternal life or heaven because i do not want to live forever because if you think about it it is a horrible fate because you will be bored for eternity. i also have a fear of death because i have extremely close relationships with my friends and a select amount of family members and i do not want to loose all of my memories of my life and my personality and all of my friends and family that i love. i am also afraid of being afraid of death because the whole christian religion with heaven is that if you believe in heaven then you get to go there but if heaven is really real and all of my friends and family go there and i am stuck in hell or eternal deathi would loose on an eternity of being with my loved ones and i would not even know it but i would spend that whole eternity in fear because i would not even know if it is real or not. now I am kind of just rambling so I am going to stop talking and just ask you this is there any way to get over this fear? how to deal with the fear of death,Depression

22998,I have always found this so demeaning. That its just life and its part of being human. It reminds me that I am weaker then everyone else for not coping. I am genuinely not sure if they are correct and I am just weak and I need to suck it up but one things for sure I need to change my meds. I live in a loving and well off family so why am I not coping. Everyone goes through this you are not special,Depression

13607,I feel I am a narcissist. When I am better than somebody at something or smarter I try to help but I get a feeling of superiority and I come off as condescending but I know I should not and I do not want to be an asshole. This makes me EXTREMELY humble. I find myself humble bragging even tho I do not want to and hate the attention. I try and lift others but I feel like I have a side that automatically looks down on others right or wrong. I can be over confident but humble it is weird. I do not like this side of me and it can effect my life believe or not it leads to self hatred. Anybody like this and feel it affects their social communication? idk I am a narcissist?,Depression
26214,I am not ready yet. But if I decide I am. I need to know just how horrible the effects are of taking a bottle of hydroxizine a bottle of trazadone a bottle of Wellbutrin 150 a bottle of prazosin and a bottle of Prozac with a bottle of liquor would truly be. Coma? Seizure? Heart failure? All seem like a possibility when taken in overdose alone but curious how effective it could be if all taken at once.. Its simple,Depression
16442,22 F Ran away from home. In the Philippine culture the adult is supported by the parents until marriage. As you know Philippines is a 3rd world country so its difficult to progress especially due to Corona. I started my job as an auditor which has a really low salary about 400 per month really low I am in the PH. My parents are narcissists and manipulative that is why I ran away. My bf who is still a college student is the one providing for me. He loves collecting things that appreciate in value. Instead of keeping his money to himself I add to his expenses. I go to vacations because of him. Note he is not rich but he still gives to me. I just want to run away and be alone and stop being a burden to everyone I know. To my friends and to my bf. I think I deserve to be alone. I want to disappear as if I did not exist. everyone is life will be better once I am gone. A burden to everyone their lives will be better once I am gone,Depression
19682,So basically I am feeling really shitty and abandoned and alone. My previous account where I had made lots of friends was permanently banned. Because someone described depressed people as their Hollow brethren so I made A Darksouls reference about how being a Hollow from Darksouls would suck because even if you killed yourself you would just get reserect at a bonfire. Then a few days later my account is banned saying I threatened violence. it is super confusing because it dosent threaten violence I just said being a hollow would suck because you would reserect everytime you tried. I do not understand do they think I was telling the o.p they should kill themselves? I appealed and it they said it still violates the threatening violence rule. So now I feel like a piece of shit. I lost all my friends and karma and got shut out of the one place I went for support. I just do not understand what I did wrong? it is stupid to feel suicidal because you lost a reddit account I know but... Feel totally shit and unwanted,Depression
26320,I made a post the other day about losing a girl who actually liked me and cared me. Due to my own ego. I have never had a girl care about me like that before and I fucked up. Not only did I fuck up something good for me but I also hurt her. I cannot live this. I will never forgive myself I do not want to because you just do not HURT people who cared about you. I think about breaking her trust. I think about how she felt when I left without saying anything. While I may have thought it was not that serious she was hurting probably doubting herself and seeing herself as the problem. I apologized through FB messenger and even though I did the guilt and regret are still there. I am now added to her list of guys who hurt her. I have gotten back into self harm because I deserve to feel pain. I deserve to bleed. I hate myself for this. there is no taking what I did back and it disturbs me SO much. I am a piece of shit and will carry this for the rest of my life which I pray ends soon. I will never forgive myself for hurting her,Depression
13228,so hi this is a very sensitive topic for me because I am just embarrassed but well here is my story i guess. Unlike others I never had imaginary friends as a child for me it started when I was 15 because I felt so lonely. He is sometimes my boyfriend but also my best friend and whenever I am alone almost always lol I have conversations with him in my head while I draw or playing video games for example. At night when I cannot sleep and feel suicidal I hug my teddy bear and imagine it is him. I always think as long as it makes me happy it is okay but then reality hits me and I feel like a failure. I mean who at 17 needs to have imaginary friends because nobody likes me and my illnesses are too complex for my family? who has never been to a party at 17? Who has never celebrated their birthday with friends at 17? Who never had friends at 17? correct! Me!. I have been rejected too many times and I am tired of trying. I have tried everything and my psychiatrist says I am too deep into my depression to ever recover. I just want to die Every day becomes more and more painful. I just give up. I still have imaginary friends at age 17 and i feel like the biggest loser. I just want my misery to end 17f,Depression
20034,Recently a lot has been going on in my life. I gained 5 new mental disorders lost my SO lost interest in most the things I used to care about just in time for me to get a call telling me Congrats! Your application and interview went perfect! you will start this weekend! Now with everything piling up I do not even want to start. I feel horrible because my best friend got me the job but I just do not want it anymore. I do not want anything. I just want to sleep and cry. Finally got a job now I do not even want to start it.,Depression
24910,I am going to rant. What I want in life is to be loved as deeply as I think I love. And I do not know if I will ever get it only because I am selfish and I am always going to want more. Or one day I am get it and it will be unhealthy for me. But I want to arrive at the end of my life someday and think about how much I have loved and how much I have been loved. I want people to be sad and I want people to remember me not for what happened when I was there but the emotional hole that I have left on their life. Like even now I fantasize about dating a girl or making friends with a guy and being so close to that person that when I leave or am pushed away they will always remember me because of whatever effect I had on them. And I want them to be sad about it. I think that is as best as I am going to be able to describe it. I feel like I am constantly holding on for dear life on a cliff and my grip is about to run out. there is just a constant strain to do anything. there is just a pull in the back of my head constantly weighing me down so I am constantly feeling that and thinking about that but then everything else just happens. Things have just been happening and I have just been there to experience it. Like I cleaned up most of my yard untill I got tired then I did the kitchen then I did the back yard. I do not think I made that much of a decision to do those things but they happened. Cutting myself too. I only recently figured out that I am doing that so that I have the scar and I can see it. And it sounds dumb saying because why else would you do it. But I just have been. I have always focused on the quality of my cuts so that way they leave a scar but. Everyday feels like a one note day and no matter what happens or what connection I make with people it resets the next day and I forget. that is another foggy thing I think. Spend a very busy day at the carnival with friendsx go home and sleep wake up and only have four real things that I can remember from that night. And I do not know if that is everyone and I should stop expecting more or not. Like everything is underwhelming and I want more. And not matter what I do nothing changes and idk. Scary How do I function,Depression
18136,they are not fond memories either they used to be but now I realize it was all an illusion. That happiness was never sustainable. where is it now?its a lie. So I figure I have always been lying to myself. To the point I do not know what is real anymore and its almost like the words lost all meaning to me. Bc it does not matter what is real anymore. Nothing does I do not feel like a person anymore just something that cannot diethats all I want now to be free of the bs. Even tho realistically all Ill do is wait it out. Waiting for nothing that is funny All I have are memories,Depression
17771,For the last year and a half Id say I was self medicating with opiates. Lots if not so much fun every day I would wake up and need them. By 48 hours I was puking my guts out. I was not doing your regular boy or H as they say I was addicted to them round little blue M 30 fentanyl filled disastroids. And I also experimented with some of that G too. never was really a fan but eventually I said man I am going to lose everything I spent less time worrying about my loved ones and more time trying to find money for drugs and let us not forget the times the dealer was out and did not have any. I woke up one day and said fuck it. I am not doing this anymore spent 12 days hurling and had explosive diarrhea. It was hell. But something was missing. I got a sponsor and finally found out why the fuck I was self medicating for so long. Turns out I needed to see a psychiatrist. Long story short I got diagnosed with anxiety and severe depression. Many of my peers and even some family do not believe in my hardships. But I struggle every day just to smile. Even when my child is around. I just wonder when Ill feel better completely. If that will ever happen. Sorry for the bitching guys. But I just wanted to share this. Btw I am 3 months clean. Thanks for listening to my rant if you did. Please someone tell me it will get better. Even if you are lying. So here it is,Depression
20858,I have Instagram Twitter and this thing. Although it can be a great distraction sometimes when I am feeling low it can make it worse. But not in the sense of being jealous of others and their happy life more so in the sense of watching all the chaos of the world and how everyone treats each other. When I am depressed this feels highlighted. Maybe that sounds stupid idk. This happen to anyone else? Social media sometimes makes things feel worse,Depression
37729,so many mistake every decision made wrong so many wasted opportunity so much brutality so much evil so much sadness so much loneliness so much failure so much betrayal so many addiction so many false hope too many failure to bear how long can my heart beat with this suffering how long until i give up,Depression
7371,I am the kind of friend who checks on or makes a conversation with my friends by messaging them and getting to know their updates. One day I decided to stop doing that just to see if someone actually initiates a conversation with me and wants to know how my life is going? its been 3 months and nobody has. I am depressed that nobody cares for me as much as I care for them. I am feeling lonely and depressed Why nobody sends in a hi how are you doing?,Depression
20263,I studied psychology in undergrad. Been trying for 2 and a half years to get into grad school. 4 rejections because I am dumb as fuck and have no utility in the real world. I have been working as a case manager for the past 2 years being an underpaid personal assistant for the chronically mental ill along with Uber driver. I have a case load of 28 I am expected each week to ensure the client is able to navigate his or her diagnosis.. Fuck I have lost hope In mental health all together next time you meet with your therapist recollect that all he or she does is reflect your thoughts and affirm your shitty decisions that lead you in to this place all together.. have you met any one in mental health field that is actually happy because its been 2 years and I have not met a soul who is not a fucking coward or in it for milking the insurance. Or who actually fucking cares about science. Where does that me. A person who lies in the diagnosis of being depressed but does not believe a word they say because its all subjective SJW BULLSHIT..What if I want to identify myself as a depressed man who drinks 8beers a day and smokes weed until my thoughts are so far gone that I would not even recall them when I am sober. What if that makes me fucking happy. You feel great satisfaction the feeling that beer gives you Yep I sure do. Idk this a rant from the most raw feeling that can express. I just want to make a difference and help people. But I cannot even help myself. What kind of adumb fuck wastes 4 years of his life to study a topic that pays so little and exposes you to daily traumas and countless victims of the universe.Fucking victims everywhere get over yourselves your going to fucking identify as depressed and anxiety ridden even though you did not have to storm the beaches of Normandy or die huddled in a gas chamber because of your religion or face persecution in any other way except for your ego to get bruised a bit because you are to fucking stupid to come up with a rational argument to yourself of why you are not fucking worthless. Act like your fucking with something because its not going to matter to anyone else but yourself. You suffer because you desire. You desire to feel something different than what you feel daily. Maybe the only thing to do is bear the suffering and bear the burden for other people. I am going to do the best I can believe that is the only thing I can do. This was no filter typing. I believe in you all just do me a favor and do not claim to be a Victim own your shit.Much love Fuck it,Depression

10036,it is been 25 weeks since my boyfriend broke up with me. I know he still likes me and I still like him. I just do not know it anymore. I thought he was the one I really wanted to marry him. I miss him so much and I absolutely need him right now but I am all alone. I have no friends and the people I do occasionally talk to straightup ignore my texts. I want him back I want to marry him. I want to dance with him I want to kiss him. I am so sad and I do not know if I can do it anymore. I honestly do not know it anymore,Depression
15230,I never have posted in this type of forum or any forum really but I am desperate to speak. just as the title says my life is meaningless. i am 22 years old and never finished high school do not have a job do not have any friends and my family has given up on me. i do the same thing every single day. i sit on my bed i play a video game for a few hours i eat i sleep and the cycle repeats. i have absolutely no motivation. sometimes i do not even shower for weeks on end the thing that makes me shower is when my mother asks me when the last time i did and i get embarrassed so i do it. if i did not have her to do that it is safe to say I would go longer without doing so. I am an introvert by nature so i do not need much social interaction anyways but i still get lonely all the time. all i really need is to talk to someone for a two minutes and my social bar is maxed for the next several months. but i still get super lonely and wish i had someone to talk to everyday to go out and have fun every once in a while. it is hard to explain how i am like that how i do not need much social interaction but i still crave it. it is my own fault i do not have any friends. i had quite a few when i was in high school but i somehow just stopped talking to them and now i do not know any of them. same with the online friends i had just a slow disconnect because of me. i do not know why i do this. i do not know how i made my life so meaningless and worthless. it happened so damn fast it seems like i woke up one day with no friends and no motivation and nothing to keep me going. it is all gone and i cannot get it back. i have borderline personality disorder and that was what gave me some hope when i was 18 like okay now i know what i have and i can rectify this and make things better. but clearly that is not how it went and I sincerely do not think anything will change. I have heard the same old things growing up. You have to change it yourself go to therapy force yourself fake it til you make it I have fucking heard it all and I have fucking tried it and nothing works. I am STUCK. I AM STUCK AND I cannot DO A GODDAMN THING ABOUT IT. i just want to start over. my life is meaningless.,Depression
22370,i was so close to getting better from this depression episode that lasted from February to the end of spring. i had gotten ready to go to a school I had been told I had a 95 chance of getting into. I feel like the world wants me to fail. it keeps showing me a better me and not letting me be it. I am hanging by a ledge,Depression
37991,you re easily replaceable and trust me they will replace you if you re lucky you ll be born into a loving and sweet family but that s often not the case for most people you re alone and will be alone for most of your time on this earth you ll reach an expiration date for your usefulness and they ll kick you to the curve it doesn t matter if you re really struggling and barely hanging on or if they re aware of what you re going through and they ll give you every excuse in the book but the simple matter of the fact is that they don t care about you anymore what do you have to offer now,Depression

13928,Last fall life was fine. I was applying to universities across the globe and getting accepted by a few. Some I even got good scholarships for. But I decided to decline these offers for a reason I have yet to discover. I thought there were better options for me. Then I got accepted into my dream university which happened to be in a country I had always dreamed of moving to. I started telling everybody that I was moving to this country. Then scholarship announcement day came out. I did not get the scholarship. I had declined every single offer I had been given up to this point because I was stupid enough to think this one university would work out. And it did not. Now I look like a failure to everyone. I had so much going for me and now its all backfiring. I had already told my boss I would be coming back in the fall and he already found my replacement. So my I am out of a job in about a month. I am stuck going to a shitty community college in my hometown in the rural west of the USA. Everyone always talks about how hard it is to be rejected by your dream school but its harder to get accepted and not be able to afford it.Nothing seems to be working out for me. Any direction I try seems to not work out. All my friends are going off to their dream schools across the country and now I am stuck in my hometown without a job. I had so much going for me and now its all gone. Its hard to not think about the life I could be should be living right now. My life is literally crumbling before my eyes and I am only 18.,Depression
26618,Idk how much longer I can keep faking being normal around people. It just seems like no matter how hard I try to improve my situation things just stay the same or new shit piles on. I am lonely and feel angry about being lonely. I sometimes think about lowering my standards which I do not think are high but no clue why I cannot find anyone to be with. I hate my job but no one wants to pay me as much with the same benefits or they are looking for someone else. I work out and do hobbies all the time yet I am out of shape and still feel stressed. I feel paranoid and cannot trust my family or friends as I feel that they only talk to me when they need something unlike me who checks in on them just to see how they are doing I mean phones work both ways.... It just seems like nothing is working out no matter how much I try or burn myself at both ends I feel exhausted and do not even know why I am doing this anymore. I do not even dream anymore my sleep consists of a short few second black void and then I wake up to go through my daily drag everyday. I try reaching out to my so called friends and family and I just get a oh I am sorry or generic are you ok? With no follow up and my family just seems to downplay it by telling me how much worse they have it and why I should not he depressed. I just feel like a wreck small things set me off from people rushing me to even seeing couples in public. I just feel that there is nothing to be happy about and tbh idk why I even bother just pointing out I am not planning on doing anything stupid before someone tries to say I am en danger or something and sorry for the vent I have no idea who else to talk to honestly The big sad just keeps getting deeper,Depression
7931,i feel stupid I am not good at academics anymore i used to have a lot of friends but i have zero now i cannot even get up to go shower or go eat and all i do is hop on the game and play to lose and I am fucking tired of waking up with eyestrain headaches. my boyfriend does not like me my best friend went to rehab my other best friend moved an hour away. i lost everything and i know I am young and everyone says you are still young it WILL get better but it never feels like it does and everyone in my grade is moving on and I am being forgotten everyone else plays sports old friends from my middle school are in the council they are cheerleaders and I am such a loser because i do not do anything. I am not good at anything everyone else has a hobby but i have actually zero and I am pathetic and fucking dumb and i wish i could have the balls to kill myself but i cannot hurt my parents and I am too pussy to even hurt myself but I am stuck in my head I am hardstuck in life just like I am hardstuck in valorant and i cannot move on and i have no friends to hang out with and i just want to not exist i wish i were never alive in the first place to suffer. i do not want to go back to school because its going to be the first day of high school and its terrifying and i cannot take it walking alone in the halls and eating alone in lunch i lost everyone i ever loved because of my self sabotaging bs and its not their fault I am fucking annoying. i wish i did not care and i wish people on instagram did not post themselves going out all the time it makes me sad and i just hate how I am a no life. no one likes me so many people blocked me and i do not know why and my only friends are online and it does not count I am so jealous of everyone else andi wish iwere my old self. I am not pretty enough to have someone that will actually have a crush on me. i need to leave so bad. i wish i were still popular like my old self and life does not feel worth living without friends. nothing feels worth it anymore. cannot handle it anymore,Depression
37676,i ve been struggling with depression for a long time now but i just my first severe instance of depersonalization and it scared me so badly i m not even entirely sure why but something about the fact that i just spent over an hour lying on the floor feeling like my body didn t really belong to me and i might not be real is so extremely unsettling to me i feel more mentally and physically myself now and just trying to process what happened is really difficult if anyone ha any kind of comfort or advice about depersonalization i d appreciate it,Depression

47763,Miserable after stopping Zoloft cold turkey and switching to Wellbutrin The zoloft appeared to stop working months ago after 6 years so I stopped cold turkey and switched to Wellbutrin which i was supposed to take with the zoloft but now I feel even worse than before. Its been over a week and the crying self hate and thoughts of self harm and suicide are too much. I just wish I could have some mental stability I cant deal with this anymore. I feel alone in this experience and consumed with horrible thoughts. Should i go back on the zoloft and take wellbutrin and zoloft together? I need to be mentally well ASAP so i can focus on my responsibilities but its been difficult.,Depression
22341,I am 23 years old with two kids and a beautiful wife. I feel so hopefully everyday feels like the day I am going to die. Between her family and my family plus her friends no one likes who i am. She went on a trip with her friends this weekend and the one picture i see of her at night is passed out in a bar. I text her friend and she acts like she is fine and everything. I am getting to the point with this depression that i need answers on what to do with my life. I feel like i do not belong on this earth and i was a mistake being here. I have chronic migraines everyday so that dosent help with any of this. Her friends are just telling me that they also have mental health problems and i need to just let them handle her. Since I have been married for over four years i feel like i should be worried about my wife around them. I would never divorce my wife because how much she means to me and what she has done for me plus helping me from depression. Any suggestions what to think or do. Sorry if i rambled. Help with my depression,Depression
18787,i hate this drug so much. I have never been so unhappy in my life. I have tried so many SSRI's but i gave up and decided to stick with cymbalta. if i miss a single day of it i get the worst migraine brain zaps anxiety and overall sick feeling. what do i even do I am so tired of trying anti depressants did cymbalta make you worse,Depression
40711,liberalnomo thirtyonemks nowthisnews so what advice would you give a man who ha depression cuz he know his sexuality is off and he s attracted to men he also feel uncomfortable in men clothes and can t get turned on from woman or would you just not even associate with them even tho they re an amazing person,Depression
8278,To be quite honest I felt validated. I have been struggling since I was 10. I am 20 now. All this time I thought there was something wrong with me or that whatever I was going through was not real. I still do not quite know how to talk about it with my family without making them worried. I struggle with suicidal ideation a lot and that is one reason why I want to tell my family that I have been struggling with depression so that they are aware of the risks. However I do not want to seek too much attention for the fear of being taken lightly or as a liability. I do not want people to think that they are obligated to make me feel good or be there for me as a form of pity. I also feel that nobody actually cares enough so why even bother. I know that is probably not true but it is hard to convince yourself of otherwise especially when you are depressed and have a particularly bad case of low esteem. I have not had the courage to tell anyone in my real life yet but I want to get it off my chest. After 10 years of struggle I was finally diagnosed with clinical depression yesterday.,Depression
13102,I have typically always been one who can dish and take jokes and things with my friends. Recently I have felt as if I am taking things in a personal manner. Not the context of the joke or comment but the repetition. It has allowed me to almost feel guilt for things that are not true or legitimate. I do not know how to tell my friends that its negatively affecting my mental health because I do not want to seem like a victim and have them assume I am too sensitive to jokes or comments that are not necessarily harsh but at the same time its exhausting me mentally and physically in ways that I cannot explain. I hope this post makes sense to someone. Has anybody experienced anything similar if so how have things went since in your relationships? Not sure how to face the feelings I am dealing,Depression
38088,it s been five year and a couple day now since my first major attempt i m not too sure how i feel to be honest ha life improved well not really of course after that first attempt i tried a couple more time i think if we look at the net value i m relatively in the same spot a i wa five year ago vibing on the bridge thankfully i m not too upset about that i think sadness and my inability to get out of said sadness is something that i will have to live with i m getting better at fighting it that s for sure are some day tiring and fucking unbearable of course but now i m just content with existing sad day are hard some day are easy i think i m just shocked that i m still alive well i definitely know that younger me would be shocked i m still kicking around maybe he d be happy that i stayed for this long there really isn t any point to this post just a bit of selfish self congratulation and the ability to say i m still alive guy i hope everyone ha a good day it s raining where i am but it s really nice to look at,Depression
12584,If you have or have had depression and is now feelingdoing better how did you go about it? Its hard for me to see the light at the end of the tunnel when just existing is a chore How dodid you get better?,Depression
14042,I opened up to my friend and talked to my therapist.They both asked me what kind of thing i needed for them to help. They asked me if i just needed someone to listen to give advice to distract etc... And honestly i had no idea what to say. Idk what i need or want.If someone asked you what you needed what did you say or what did someone do that you did not expect but found helpful? When you open up to someone about your depression what do you want them to do to help you?,Depression
37713,there s this idea that people will say you can always count on me never bottle up your feeling share and you do that and everything will be alright the truth is that people will lose their respect for you they ll think of you a a problem and will just feel obligated of half assing some help not worth it i ll just suffer in silence ok,Depression
27136,I think because I am alone its always the day I wish I could just die. However I never do it because I do not want to ruin that holiday for my friends or family members. I do not want my mom to hate Fourth of July forever because she lost me. So instead I just lay in my bed and drink and pretend everything will someday get better when we all know it never fucking gets better. I always want to kill myself on holidays,Depression
7415,For context I am 19 years old. I do not have a job nor do I go to school. I am trying to find a job and getting my permit but it all seems in vain.I live in a toxic enviroment with my mother and my grandfather who has sexually abused me as a child. My father does not give the slightest shit and instead reminds me of how much of a burden I am every two seconds. My mother can be hella abusive to the point of ganging up against me with my grandfather.My body always feels exhausted and tired. My medications are not fucking working. I am in so much pain all of the fucking time I cannot take it anymore.My mother likes to comment on my self harm scars and insult me.I do not have any friends. Nobody gives a shit about me or my emotions. Every time I open up I get invalidated or dismissed entirely. I know its not people's job to care about me but it would be nice if someone understood me.I am so fed up with this. I just want to slit my throat the emptiness and hopelessness is becoming worse,Depression
15082,Yesterday something happened to my friend and they went into crisis and blocked me without warning. I was really worried so I called the police they checked on her and told me she was ok. She unblocked me later that night and only gave me vague comments of what happened. Clearly it is something big and this has not happened to them in the time I have known them so this is new ground for me and the my friend. When I am in crisis I like to be comforted by people I am close with a few months ago when I was in crisis and was sent to hospital for 3 weeks all I wanted was to talk to them to feel safe. So I have been trying to do that for them. My intentions are well but I forgot she told me that she likes to be alone. They kept blaming herself for me going into hospital and wanted to give me space because that is what theywould like.Always remember to treat people the way you like to be treated if that person likes it because now I am scared I have made it worse and lost them now. I just want them to be safe I treat people how I would like to be treated,Depression
14205,8 months ago I was diagnosed with burnoutdepression and anxiety. For 4 months I tried doing sports and took StJohn's Wort. In march I tried Lexapro for 3 months which helped me but made me extremly sleepy no motivation sexual side effects etc.. Then 3 weeks on effexor which were hell. I now started Trintellix for a month and only see slight improvements. In total I have been depressed for 8 months and I am afraid I will never fully recover..I am seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist too. I also had a breakup 1 month ago.. Can you give me your advice please ? Everyday passes I am loosing hope.. I am afraid to stay depressed for life ! Please help,Depression
39362,so i already posted something about this before but it wa more of a vent this is more of a flailing desperate attempt to figure out what to do i have a jury summons tomorrow morning i m crossing my finger that somehow despite it being the weekend they might still update my status a ended so i don t have to go but i know my chance are slim to none i know myself well even if i manage to get any sleep at all tomorrow morning will be hell on earth my anxiety is gon na have a field day it s already pregaming right now given that info i wa wondering if any of you have called in sick to your jury summons because of anxiety and how that went i m willing to try going but should i find that my anxiety is just too much i d like to have some sort of a plan b it kind of scare me the idea of calling in cause idk if they d consider sickness caused by anxiety a good enough reason besides that i know some place will just have you reschedule while others might not be so easy going all this legal stuff freak me out i don t want to be held in contempt sent to jail or fined but i also would rather not have to have a mental break down in front of a bunch of people i don t really have any medication that can help other than propranolol but all that doe is slow my heart rate the last time i took it to try and help during a stressful event i still felt short of breath and really nauseous which wa honestly kind of new i ended up having to hide away from people for like an hour till i felt somewhat better even then after another hour or so i started feeling really anxious again idk what to do i know jury summons isn t really that bad most normal people just think it s boring but for me having so much wait time will just lead to me obsessing over how i m feeling i can t really distract myself that well because i ll constantly be anticipating being called up which could be within the first hour could be multiple hour or possibly not at all on top of that it s early in the morning which i have a pretty bad track record with too early morning like that usually result in me feeling nauseous which result in me not being able to eat much you can t eat in the assembly room but you can t really leave in case they have an announcement so i d have to wait if i wait too long i start to feel really shaky and weak i d say hypoglycemic but i ve been tested for that and apparently i don t have it maybe i m just in starvation mode all the time so i run out of energy nutrient fast anyways any advice is welcome,Depression
16348,So for most of my teenage years I have lived with moderate depression. No formal diagnosed disorder but have a history of treatment and hospitalization. I mentioned it during an argument and y'know what I hear? You have a good life compared to me! My life SUCKED. You cannot be depressed. This is funny because my life has not been that great either. Not the worst but definitely below average. It gets funnier they tell me it is my phone and that I need to go outside. That going for a walk helped me with my feelings it will help you! DUDE STARING AT GRASS WHILE MOVING is not EXCITING?? HOW THE HLL IS NATURE going to CURE MY DEPRESSION??? They even brought up god being there for me. Anyways what is some horrible sht you all have heard about depression? Someone just told me to go outside,Depression

17894,I feel like I have been alone my whole life. I used to constantly wish I could find someone to start a relationship with. It was at the point where it would hurt when I thought about it. But in recent months I have lost interest. it is like I want to be alone. It does not even bother me. it is just how I feel. I feel completely numb when it comes to what I want from other people. Is this something that most people experience? Alone for so long,Depression

21243,I oftentimes want to kill myself but I only feel depressed some weeksdaysmonths while being suicidal is always there even when I am feeling great. So does wanting to die directly correlates to being depressed? Because hey I am not depressed I just want to kill myself does not sound very convincing it just makes me wonder. I admit now that I am probably depressed but I spent years doubting myself and wondering if I was just lazy and worthless nowdays I believe it is both. Does being suicidal equals to depressed?,Depression

47885,I feel guilty about being alive I feel as though all my life I have been becoming unlovable. I can see myself decay. The things I enjoyed are meaningless and because I exist and interact with others I take a part of the joy away from them too.I do not want to live.But I dont want to hurt the few people that might get affected by it. I feel guilty to a point where I wish I get terminally ill and succumb.I feel guilty for taking up space and being here.,Depression

10999,I do not know why things are so complicated but still simple. I am 18 M and feel a lot of weight of having to perform and earn a decent living for myself but also the expectation of having significant other too.I am now on a walk after helping my dad out with work because I felt like shit not because of the work or my dad.If anything the walk just made me feel physically tired and lonely and shit. I thought this walk would be nice and refreshing but it was the total opposite. I just wanted to feel something nice but all I really feel is lonely and emptiness.Little things slowly nibble away at me Being denied a job opportunity for work experience Seeing my friends hang out but I am just lonely af Seeing others together and happy then I question what is wrong with me Having in the back of my head that everyone else is going off to uni and having a great time and I am stuck by myself trying to scrape things up to hopefully get into pharmacy school I do not even have much interest I am only doing it to earn money because my interests will not be able to earn me sufficient money to live Just feeling like nothing will get better despite my efforts which also just makes it harder to be and consistently stay motivated Me gaining weight and looking less attractive than I already am.Any advice is appreciated thank you for taking your time out of your day to read this. I do not understand what I have,Depression
22892,I work at cx service and is tired receiving shit from most of the people. Why cannot they be nice? That is part of why I hate my life. I mean that has a lot of consequences. I hate my job. I am unhappy and I want to kms. I wish it were as easy as just quit but I am afraid What if I do not earn enough? What if I quit and I am still being unhappy? Why if I am not good enough to work somewhere else? Self esteem issues. Why you got to be so rude?,Depression

16977,I went the the mental hospital in February and a lot of things have happened since then. So I have been distracted from the fact that I was put there for a week. I was reminded recently and it immediately made me resentful and kind of angry. Does this reminder ever get to you and how do you deal with it? Couple of months out from the hospital,Depression
20855,I fake it. I get up. Do work. Workout. Cook. Socialize. A good day by anyone's standards. Then I lay down a just say I wish I was dead. That day was not worth living. I wish I had never existed. And it is never going to get better. And those are the good days. How much longer do I have to stick around? Even on my best days.,Depression
47196,I 15F cannot do this shit anymore. Major TW Suicidal talk Its midnight. I have to get up at asscrack early tomorrow. I cant go to sleep because of how fucking anxious I am. I feel like everyone fucking hates me and tolerates me for some reason. Maybe because theyre scared maybe some sort of pity I dont know. Im sick of being yelled at whenever Im at home Im sick of it all. I cant do this. I want out so badly but I cant get away. I cried in school today because she screamed at me in the car. She didnt care at all. Does anyone fucking care? People say they do but realistically theres no reason. I wish people would just get it out of the way and stop being fucking pussies and just tell me if they had an issue so I could stop being a fucking burden. Im pissed and Im scared and I hate myself and I hate people around me and I wish I could just end it all right here and right now but I cant because IM TOO MUCH OF A PUSSY. The closest thing I can do is starve myself and throw my guts up which is a fun little tradition that Ive had for over a year. Thankfully my mother being the kind soul she is tells me that is bad and will make me fat. Thanks mom! Im just so sick of this. Im powerless and weak and I know I am and I wish I had access to a rope right now. Ill probably forget all about this in the morning too its just that today was a fucking hell day. Im tired.,Depression

21812,I do not think the worst part of losing a friend is actually losing them. I think the worst part is seeing them so happy without you there. To see them all hanging out and having fun with no thought of you. Or when something funny or amazing happens and the people you used to tell it to no longer talk to you so you cannot turn to them. And the absolute worst part is when you realise that they never really invited you to out to begin with and you start to realise all the lies they told you about why you could not come. Seeing them all out together and you cannot really say anything or feel any type of way because that means that you are either too needy or have serious fomo. Worst part,Depression

17793,I have a loved one with depression. When he pushes me away I say stubbornly that Ill stay. But he says that hes a burden. How do I assure him hes not?? Saying you are not a burden is not very convincing.Also I try to be positive and motivational and he tells me not to. what should I do then? I do not know what to say. He also feels guilty that I do so much for him and I have complained before that my needs are not met well I feel guilty for this. How do I make him feel that what he does it enough and encourage him? How do I ask about needs without pressuring him? I have pressured him about needs. He wants to break up because he says me pressuring him makes him feel like hes not enough. what is some things I can say? Should I apologize? I feel really bad. how to make them feel like they are not a burden,Depression
40415,my imagination is not vivid enough to have faith in god spirit and the afterlife death will come no matter what and when it come your consciousness dissappears you don t feel pain you don t feel happiness you don t feel sadness you feel nothing and you think nothing you simply cease to exist but i respect those who want to live it s futile sure but i respect their decision the thing is if you want to live then you have to be strong in order to make it through all the hardship life throw at you weakling will only hinder the strong there are those who wa weak but then became stronger and then there are those like me who stay weak and doesn t have the will to get stronger my friend my family my relative and my neighbor all do their job despite not really liking them while i m just lying here not wanting to do anything if god actually existed he would be a sadist for putting me in such a strong body i once eat on the same table with two covid 9 patient without catching it or maybe he s also a weakling who can never get thing right my body should ve been used by someone stronger than me like steven hawking then i would kill myself once our body got exchanged he is someone who can actually contribute to the world of the living my death would be that by hanging once i m dead all people have to do is untie the rope and throw me into the fire they won t have to waste time finding my body they won t have to scrape my brain and blood off the wall and i will make sure to write a note telling the police that i have not been murdered by anyone directly or indirectly everyone will go on with their life and maybe forget who i am which is definitely a good thing those thought are like an immortal entity i can do nothing but run away from it by distracting myself with anime meme game novel music self harm that entity however would simply sit down and wait patiently because it know full well that no matter what i do i would still stumble into it hand,Depression
11521,Like the title says. My Dad Mom and brother have all been abusive to me in my life. I am about to enter in a legal battle to regain property that I have already been awarded by a court that may end in me losing. My Dad had me sign some sketchy contracts that gave him enormous power over me. My brother sneers with glee that everyone knows that he raped and beat the shit out of me for ten years and nobody loves me enough to do anything to stop him. My Mom has forced me to be around my brother so she can feel okay she always backs them up when they are derisive dismissive or destructive as that is just the way they are. Or well they are just trying to .I want to die. They win. I lose. I want them to see the totality of a life they had in their power from birth to death. I am having suicidal ideation of killing myself in front of my familyabusers.,Depression

17891,Hey guys this is my first ever Reddit post. I am struggling. I have already had panic disorder major depression and anxiety but this year has been really bad. I am 20 years old and my dad lost his job due to his alcoholism in October. I was not prepared for this and had no savings my mom gave me some money that she had tucked away to help me move out I moved out and my roommates were horrible to me and I was miserable I ended up in a mental health facility with suicidal tendencies. After I got out I decided it was a good idea to move back in with my mom but out of a manic paranoid decision I quit my job. My mom assured me that if I took a month off it would be okay because my dad had some unemployment left well turns out he does not and the lease here ends in two months and I have 0 saved up to go any where and neither does my mom. We are on the verge of being homeless. I start a new job on Thursday but doubt I will make enough in two months to pay my bills AND move out. I am desperate for a place to live soyesterday I swallowed my pride and asked my sister if I could stay with her and her boyfriend for a few months because they have an extra bed room that they do not use and I thought I was really close with her. She straight up told me no and it crushed me. I love her so much and we have always been so close ands he knows the situation I am in. I know it is not her job to take care of me but Jesus Christ I am dying here. I do not know what else to do and I am scared the relationship with my sister is cracked now. My friend offered me a place to atay at her parents which is so generous of them but what about my mom ? Where is she and my dog to go. I could move into a place with her and help her pay the rent but I am so sick of my parents fincancial problems being my problems. Ever since we were little money has always been the topic of conversation . I feel like I was robbed of my childhood and young adult hood. I know it sounds like I am throwing myself a pity party but I did not get the same opportunity my siblings did they got to stay with my parents until they were ready to leave I am being forced into the world without a clue of what I am fucking doing. Anyways I have no idea how to be alive I feel like i do everything wrong and I make inpulsive decisions and I feel like a fucking failure at barley 20 years old. This has really taken a hit to me and my mental illnesses and I am struggling with suicidal thought agin. If anyone has any advice for me I would gladly take it . Thank you for listening if you made it this far. Hi I need help,Depression

7095,Hey so this morning I was focused on doing my life coach training etc and was tagged in a story on fb about another person who is life has been flipped upsidedown since being vex jabby day.I noticed she had thousands of responses to her story. But I have had less than 15.This knocked me off the motivation train. As I have been struggling alot with motivation these last few weeks as I feel tired and just sleep all the time. So given I am not in a good head space it has left me feeling bumbed out.Guess years of being in the mindset I do not want to be seen offgrid is paying off. Since recently decided to get my story out there to connect with other people who have gone through similar situation. To not feel so alone and isolated.Do you get this?? Does anyone understand?? Motivation Train,Depression

I just want all this to end. Burst into tears at work today. I feel like I am going absolutely insane.,Depression

14671,So a friend was really stupid with me and stuff and I was able to forgive her right away and I am loving talking to her. but I still have a huge grudge against her. she did not talk to me for over a year just because she heard an unfounded rumor about me. I do not even want to delve into the rumor but it was fundamentally wrong and she apologized about it. however i keep thinking about it i hate to think that maybe i love her and i want to die every day all the time Depression and friendship???,Depression
8878,For the last few weeks I have been struggling to get out of bed for a reason too even occasionally skipping breakfast. Been annoyed by others for a small reason like the way they breathe or walk to the point I lie to people who know me just to avoid being near them. I do not like getting out anymore because I now spend my time looking at people and wondering why I do not come out as normal when I do the same as them and the paranoia of them looking at me makes me want to be angered to the point of a migraine. Have been treating people I do not know with hostel words and actions because I believe I am more physically capable to hurt them or that the consequences are not enough for me to care. Have acted in blatant predatory and manipulative behavior. we are I fallow people in public from inside stores to parks to their cars I do not even know why. I had been dragged out to a party with my cousin and he told me that he had been threatened by another guy there. Said it got to the point he was scared he would be hurt and asked me to help. I then spent the next two hours going to his bothers car Walmart to get a bat and followed him home. I parked a block away and walked by the trees with the bat at hand. He then got out so walked after got close enough that I whistled and busted his knee and ankle and ran like hell. The only problem is that I like to much. Been so used to my mother and others telling me what to do that I struggle to get things done to the point where I keep making my personality up as I go to make myself normal since I was told by my teachers and parent. Always hated everyone else since I was a kid only having friends knowing that if I do not I would have either kind myself or someone else out of the hated I get filling myself with distractions to avoid myself. I am starting to break and all these lies of morality fake friendships and saying I am ok even tho I want to bash a skull is too much to handle I am on the edge of freaking out and self hated and honestly a little scared just need suggestions. I want to yell but cannot,Depression
18764,I was raised by my grand parents because my parents broke up and left me when i was very little. When i was a child the only people i could talk to was my grand parents because i had no one other than them. I am the only child and i had no family other than my grand parents. I also never had a friend because i rarely see people other than my grand parents. I do not know how to talk to young people like me and make friends because all my life I have been around really old people. I like my grand parents but I am really tired of being around old people they suck all my energy and make me feel like I am old too. I do not really have anything to talk with them now so they just watch tv all day and we do not talk much. So the problem is I am in my room all day with nothing to do no one to talk and nowhere to go. When i go outside i see people around their friends and family and knowing that I am all alone makes me feel worthless. So i feel bad and head home again. But there is nothing to do at home so i start thinking questioning my life and existence. And that makes me feel worse because i got nothing and no one to live for. I do not know what to do with my life and i do not really enjoy living. Life seems really bleak right now and I am hopeless.This is my second language so I am sorry if i made any mistake while writing this. .,Depression
38672,hi all i m working in human resource for a smaller company and we re keen to making sure we re being inclusive we ve managed to implement flexibility for those who celebrate different religion belief new parent and a variety of physical disability but we re still learning when it come to neurodiversity generally we re very ambitious and strong believer in inclusion for all so we want to make sure we re going above and beyond rather than just doing the bear minimum my question for you is what process and or action have you seen company take that were groundbreaking or in some may made a major difference to you a someone with anxiety it can also be something you heard of rather than something that happened to you specifically if you don t know a company doing something that you feel would be very effective what would you love to see a company do,Depression

20970,it is the hope that kills you. Time to go back to being depressed and pessimistic whilst the whole world celebrates and laughs at our misery coz of a few assholes. Dumbass bandwagonning from cunts on social media does not help. It would have been perfect too. Final at Wembley almost fully packed stadium cheering on the lads. 55 years of hurt. World Cup next year. Telling myself France losing the Euros in 2016 then winning the World Cup is a good sign. But i told myself playing at Wembley this year was a good sign. England not helping,Depression
13747,My reputation is in the gutter. I have no friends. Any people I do talk to say a word then immediately have something to do. I pass the time playing the same thing on gutiar over and over again watching Naruto playing btd5 or btd6. Multi tasking the fck out of anything I could possibly do to distract myself from the overwhelming sense of loneliness.I tried seeking advice from a professional therapist. Not really willingly. I was sent to a inpatient facility after telling a teacher I wanted to kill myself. I told him what if you texted them something and you were right there and saw them get the notification but they ignored it.He said you are trying to copeI think the original discussion was about how people are not ignoring you. 9 times out of 10 they are actually busy so you have to be considerate and think about those possibilities.I just sat there and replied ... ohThen time went by and I was out. Now its been...idk 46 months since and I still do not talk to anyone. They take too long to respond. They do not want to go explore places with me. They avoid me. Not until just today did I realize how utterly alone I was. I always tried my best to get attention. I did crazy things. But now that is my foundation for my reputation. A lunatic. I feel pathetic. Even asking the internet as if they are going to do anything. How do you make friends?,Depression
18006,I am 27 I live alone. No friends no family no one. I want to do so much better for myself I cannot sleep for days and when I do I sleep way too much. I am living in disarray with no drive to do anything about it. I am pretty sure this is not how my life should be going at this point but I literally know nothing else. My whole life has been this way gad some traumatic events happen as a child and again as a young adult. I do not dwell an the past but I have been emotionally and mentally destroyed to a point I literally feel nothing all the time. Maybe tomorrow will be the day I feel normal again. How do I get better?,Depression

8550,You ever notice? Therapists will see you for 45 mins once a week at most a psychiatrist will maybe see you once a month if you are lucky and the rest of the time? Just deal with your own shit. Are you miserable?Wallowing in your bed all day? Too sad to brush your own teeth or hair? Crying at the smallest thing? Ready to die but not able to muster the effort to plan it?Oh fcking well. Handle it. No one wants you to reach out. Mental health professionals just want to help the Karens of the world with their drinking problems so they can take Little Billy to soccer practice without getting a DUI and then all the therapists and psychiatrists can go home to their wonderful well adjusted families and think about what nice people they are because they help people when really they have helped no one. Everyone says Reach out when you need help but when you reach out it is almost impossible to get help unless you are actively endangering your life or someone else's.,Depression
12999,I just started phlebotomy school before that I was pretty depressed and could not leave my bed and showered about once a weekI still am. Its great and all that I am furthering my education but when the day ends and the weekend comes I am too mentally and physically drained to do anything. How do I maintain a social life? I have not had a social life in almost 2 years. I see one person for a day and I need a week to gain the energy to go out or see someone again. My stomachs drops when a close friend asks to hang out I just cannot fathom staying up till 4am and having to entertain for a full 24 hours its exhausting. At this point I do not want any friends because Ill just disappoint them when I do not want to hang out at all. I am getting comfortable never seeing or talking to anyone. I am just existing at this point,Depression
16710,I thought it would be nice to relax and meditate. I guess I did not think about the sharing and connecting with others part of it. Every time I had to share I almost died of anxiety. Questions like What do you fear? and other things I have not even told my therapist.At the closing we went around in a circle and each person shared a special moment they had with another person on the trip how that moment made them feel and that they now feel complete.I do not know what I expected but I was the only person that was not chosen by anyone in the group. I could not really think of anything to share either but it hurt. It really hurts. Like just in case I forgot this was a reminder that I literally do not fit in anywhere and am incapable of forming connections with others. I am so stupid to have forgotten exactly how broken I am. I do not know what I was thinking. And now I cannot stop crying in this airport shuttle and I really hope no one notices. I am so stupid to have come here. I am so stupid to think that anyone could ever do more than just tolerate me. I am so stupid to think that I could ever belong anywhere. I went to a yoga retreat,Depression
19016,So I talked to a girl that has similar trauma to me. it is almost scary how much we have in common and the conversations were so effortless. I totally let down my guard and opened up like I have never with anyone. But now I feel her pulling away from me she still seems to check in on me and expresses concern but it just feels off. I want to tell her but I cannot even bring myself to tell her that I even want to talk so I am just telling her I am fine and hiding behind my dark humor. I tried to have no expectations but pathetic sad me started to feel some kind of way and now I am even more lost than I was before. I just do not know what to do with myself anymore. Opened up now I feel even greater despair,Depression
20942,I have no motivation for anything. I do not want to do anything but lay in bed and scroll on my phone. I do not eat properly or take care of myself. I have things I should be doing like cooking cleaning exercising etc but laying in bed doing nothing is much more appealing to me. I get its okay to do this every once in awhile but I feel like I am in this rut where its happening everyday. No motivation,Depression
27032,Long time ago I met an girl through an support group on social media. She had an partner and decided to stop talking to me Months pass by and all a sudden she decided to get back in touch with me. She told me she thought about mewe decided to become strictly friends. I eventually learned she was in an unhappy and loveless relationship. We soon became close and developed feelings for each otherit became an affair. I was a single guy.My own circumstances were not perfect either I urged her to leave her relationship and start a new life with me. She left to be with her family and eventually went back to her bf I was heartbroken we decided to start again. It looked like she was never going to leave him I had enough and ended it for good. It took a toll on my mental health and I had an mental breakdown was nearly driven to suicide.I learned from someone else that she did eventually leave her bf and found someone else. They are in happy relationship and post their pics on social media. Not many people knew about me. I do not know how I feel about it. I sometimes feel like anger and total regret something I never do again. I feel like the bad person sometimes. It has messed with my head still sometimes. Thanks for reading Sad affair,Depression

12769,i got my period yesterday night and i have not had the strength to get up take a shower and change my clothes. i feel disgusting I have never done this before. i have ate just been in bed mostly. and all my mom can say is get up clean ur room. too depressed to get up,Depression
11444,I honestly do not even know where to start. I do not want to dox myself or share my entire life story so I will try to keep this concise and to the point.In the spring of 2020 I went to rehab. Afterwards I moved out of state and spent 6 months in sober living. I had originally planned to spend a year and possibly start a whole new life in this new state but as fate would have it my dad's health kept getting worse and worse. Trying to be a good son I moved back home to look after him. I will be forever grateful for being able to spend the last 2 weeks or so of his life with him. He died 2 days before Christmas. I stayed with my dad's brother for about a week that was not working out. My uncle's oldest son feeling bad for me offered to let me stay with him and his wife on the condition that I stayed sober and found a job so that I could pay rent. I ended up staying with them for about 6 months until I had had enough. One day I overheard him talking with his brother on the phone bragging about how well I was doing and how hard I was working. here is what killed it for me he then starts talking about how my parents did not make it easy for me they fcked him up pretty good and then he went for the jugular I loved uncle redacted God love him but he was a fck up.Like dude it is not enough that I am working full time I am paying you money to stay here and when I am not busting my hump at my paying job I am cleaning your house washing dishes vacuuming cleaning the yard doing all the things that you are too lazy to do so you wait for your wife to deal with it. So really I am doing all these things FOR FREE to make her life easier since you will not and you thank me by disrespectinginsulting my dad who JUST DIED?! Oh hell no. To this day I still have not confronted him. Instead I have chosen to forgive him but I will never forget how that made me feel.In the effort to save face and leave as gracefully as possible I said thank you both for your hospitality I will be forever grateful it is time for me to be my own man and go my own way. That was the end of June. I have been homeless ever since.The little bit of money I have managed to save not squander away I have been slowly bleeding away living in hotels. My 2 weeks notice at my job will be up next Friday after which I will be attending a trade program for 6 weeks. I am in my mid 30's never finished 4 year college although I have an Associate's degree and these last few years I have really been racking my brain trying to figure out what to do with my life. I mean I am currently working at an auto parts factory making under 12 an hour and have been working 13 hour days for a while now and have literally nothing to show for it. I am sick and tired of breaking myself down day in and day out a prisoner of the time clock. it is time for me to find something that will pay way better than what I am doing now something where I can make a good life for myself without breaking my back something I can see me doing until I retire.I got paid today and I get paid again on the 6th. Whatever I make between now and the 6th is going to have to last me til I graduate school about halfway through September. I have reached out to friends and family on FB to see if anyone can or is willing to help hell I would even take a sublease at this point. So far no luck. Even my own mom asked me if I knew anyone who was looking to rent out a room.About the only possible saving grace I can think of at this point would either be to reach out to my local housing authority and live in section 8 for a while or to liquidate my stock portfolio and try live off that until I graduate school in September. I would really rather not have to go that route if I can help it because the stock in question is potentially poised to take the fck off soon and I would hate to miss out on a possible once in a lifetime opportunity. Normally my dad would be my 1st consultation regarding such matters but he is gone and about the only other person I have in this world that I can talk to without fear of judgement is his sister my beloved aunt who in many ways is more of like a mother than my own flesh and blood.I feel lost you all. I am broke depressed mourning stressed burnt out tired hurting and I have no idea what to do.TL DR I have been homeless since the beginning of this month after leaving my cousin's house because I refused to tolerate any further disrespect. Now I am trying to make what little money I have last until after I graduate trade school in September. It can only get better from here right?,Depression

21372,24MI do not know what to do. Nothing makes me happy any more in the last year I have alienated all of my friends from the past 820 years with the exception of one who I saw today and even then I felt like the spark was not there any more. All the others 15 people all decided to excommunicate me simultaneously and I still do not fully understand why. Its been the most traumatic time having all the people I have held closest to my heart all turn their backs on me at once and its left me with feelings of hatred towards myself and feelings of total emptiness and unbearable lonelinessI feel unlovable and unlikeable when I look in the mirror I hate what I see looks aside I loathe the person I have become over the past years I find it hard to make friends now because if I were anyone else I know I would not want to be my friend. I am awkward shy ugly and have nothing to offer in any situation. I feel like every interaction is forced and that even when I try my hardest its still painfully obvious that I am an insecure wretch. I am unemployed uneducated and no longer have anyone to talk to besides my councillor once a week. Not sure if that is really doing much for me either. I no longer enjoy anything that used to interest me I have even given up on music at this point. All I want is some companionship but feel like Ill never be able to attain it because I have become so fucking numbed out and boring that no one ever wants to befriend me. I do not know what I want to do with my life and feel like I have no real guidance so I am destined to work soul destroying jobs that I hate that make me miserable.I just feel so alone and that I am unable to do anything about it because my feelings of not being good enough because me to constantly push other people away for fear they might see me the same way I see myself. I do not even want to try any more every time I have something good I still manage to fuck it up beyond repair and end up back at square one. Life just does not feel like its worth all of this pain and loneliness. I do not understand how it can ever get better Feeling like I am at the end of my rope,Depression
47426,Weird suicide thoughts Im severely suicidal and do selfharm almost everyday. Only on one part of the body so even if I have band aid on it all the time it wont look as weird if I have several.But what I want to share when I think about killing myself the first thing that comes to my mind is how it would inconvenience everyone around me. I dont have much people who actually love me like close to zero. But I still think about how it would be a hassle for them to like ship my body since I live far away from my immediate family.The second thing that comes to my mind is its absolutism and irreversibility. Im an atheist and I think when Im gone I have nowhere to go. Ill just stop existing. No heaven to watch how they will react or if they will miss me or think of me at least.I hope I get the courage I need soon to end it all and when I get that courage Im pretty sure Ill be happy to go.,Depression
14515,All I ever wanted was a friend because you long for something you do not have right? As a kid when i was just 3 years hardly I would look around and see others eating together playing around with a FRIEND. it is an age where you do not know anything and just be friends with anyone around. Well this was what i thought because you be having no understanding that time and be pretty innocent. We all say being an adult sucks but no it sucks to be a kid like me. Even at that age no one ever wanted to be my friend nor talk to me and it was because of this girl who had two sidekicks and they went around telling the whole class to not even talk or sit beside me. Now you go and tell it to the teacher or your parents or something but at that age i did not know anything and so just let that happen to me. I would just cry by myself and tryna impress her tryna make her a friend but now i regret that am angry at myself to be that girl and not kick her ass. I went thru such trauma from a very early age.That did not stop there it went on for years and is still going but the only difference is I roast their fucking ass now but I do not want to be this girl. I have random breakdowns and my life became better when i got my first friend in my 8th grade. I started pouring out myself to him and i felt better but I do not want to do this anymore I was not this girl who used to depend on others he makes me feel weak. When i never shared my trauma at that age then why now? But here i am. That went till my fourth grade with her in my class. My things were stolen each time hidden or just simply thrown away in the dustbin. In fifth our classes were shuffled and I get this class teacher who hated me. She holds my face and scratches on my forehead with her pen. People never wanted me to sit near them they felt disgusted to even lend me a pen. Got a few fake friends till 7th later which I already knew but I let toxicity in my life because for once I was not lonely and it felt better. That girl who used to bully was this super cute popular girl who dated every senior and I never knew any I never knew anything because i was so lost with dealing with these.And again unfortunately we were in the same class again in 8th grade and this was when the seniors noticed me because I was in the same class as hers and all of a sudden I get fame became the girl every senior wanted while she was getting pretty jealous of me. I did not love that place either. I told myself to move on from all those tears she made me cry and when she hung around I did not ignore but just spoke less and there was this day where we both were alone at an event and she decides to make me her accompany for the day and well we both just looked out for ourselves. I do regret hanging around with her but I have always been easy to be manipulated and at the end of the day her aunt comes and pulls me by my arm with a tight grip and spits on my face telling me to stay away from her niece because am a spoilt brat. My eyes just teared up but no I walked away. I was spoilt for talking to her boyfriend who her aunt did not even know about.She always got things so easy friends opportunities guys awards. Not that she was good at it because her aunt was the administrative or smth of the school and she was pretty. I had to earn every of those. And again my only bestf was my senior who left the school and I am having to face those kids once again though we still talk and tryna meet up. It feels i will never be able to move on from this as I have always ignored i was going through this and today it just feels like a lot to ignore again. I do not expect anyone to read this till here but if you did thank you I have been broken for so long and now it is hard to put back those pieces.,Depression
47331,I need some guidance stopped drinking 3 years ago multiple bad experiences since and I feel seperate to everyone and everything I'm struggling atm. Not as bad as I have been previousy however my logical mind seems to be undermining me. Everywhere I go it feels like people only want relationships that have a transactional value. The person that I am doesn't matter lots of people can't understant even basic concept regarding lots of things yet I seem to understand them fine. For instance 'giving without receiving' seems to be something the majority of people can't understand. I try and find communities but my values of 'trying to not inflict suffering' and looking at the world in way that is communitive rather than idividualisticseems to be considered 'extreme'. The only friends I had made since I got sober verbally and physically abused me and the other people didn't stand up for me and then acted like nothing happened after I lost my home due to it. I tried to go to the buddhist center for guidance as it seems most inline with a lot of my beliefs but there wasn't a proper teacher there and very few members. I need some help with human contact. How to find a group that isn't so polarzed it creates echo chambers and also not so unaware it is detrementle for mental health. I volunteer I go to the gym. I'm fit and healthy except for my mind atm and even then it's because I live in a world where I see all the death and hatred and how easy it couldbe different so possibly understandable I would just like to beleive that I am not invisable. That I matter to someone somewhere. But I don't. If I died right now it would be an inconvenience because someone else would have to stop what they were doing to clean up and post an add on roomshareampx200BI feel like I spent so much time learning buddhism and stoicism just to be confronted by a world that is incredibly selfish and doesnt want me in it. And I understand this is black and white thinking and I understand this isn't the entire planet but it's the world that is available to me and the possibilities are lacking,Depression
24980,Hi I just made my Reddit account and I am wondering if anyone can relate to what I am experiencing.I am a 24 year old male and am a glassescontact lens wearer who has worn contacts since middle school with no issues.Due to anxietydepressionpossible ADHD I have been on and off various medications for the last 510 years. However the majority of that time I have been on no meds at all due to adverse side effects.About 3 years ago when I was trying Lexipro I began to have weird vision side effects. At first people tried to assure me it was just my anxiety. After a few weeks on the medication though it became clear to me it was not just in my head. I was experiencing intense light sensitivity and glowing halo effects around lights that were bad enough to make me scared to drive at night. It was affecting my ability to work and have normal interactions with others. Thankfully our family friend is an Ophthalmologist and was able to see me a number of times. My eyes looked normal aside from dryness and my prescription did not seem to have changed. I discontinued taking the Lexipro but continued to experience the vision problems for at least a few weeks but finally they subsided. Mental health professionals have told me this does not make sense and that side effects should have subsided almost immediately after discontinuing use but I know for a fact it was the Lexipro.I had no vision problems after that until very recently right after I began taking antidepressants again.First I tried Prozac and then Venlafaxine each for about 2 weeks I pretty much immediately noticed vision side effects which is why I jumped ship after a couple weeks. This time however it was more blurred vision and lack of clarity rather than light sensitivity. I am currently taking Anafranil and am still experiencing blurred vision and lack of clarity. Its bad enough to make reading very difficult and has made it extremely hard to concentrate. I have seen my Ophthalmologist but things again seem normal expect for dryness. I am committed to trying the Anafranil for at least 2 months in hopes that it helps my depression and anxiety but am getting discouraged.It seems I am clearly very susceptible to vision side effects from antidepressants. Has anyone else had similar experiences? I feel I need to be on an antidepressant but cannot take these side effects much longer. I am at a loss of what to do.

47827,Learnt something new... Did u know? idecisive Is being indecisive a symptom of depression Yes. In fact trouble making decisions is one of the most common psychological symptoms of depression. Other depression symptoms such as difficulty concentrating and lack of motivation can make decisionmaking even harder.I did not know this as I can be indecisive quiet a bit when I think about it but I only thought to look it up yesterday when I mentioned I was to a friend... I can be indecisive due to changing my mind about going for a drink Then decided to look up what it really meant and was surprised to see it relates to people who suffer from depression. Interesting!!!Are you someone who suffers from Depression and is indecisive?,Depression
20010,Sleepless sad scrolling through rdepression and feeling worse as a result. But I scroll anyway because I feel so alone. I want to see all the people that feel how I feel. it is sadistic but I want to fucking know I am not the only one. One of those nights,Depression
40059,is it weird to think i m getting closer and closer to taking my own life soon year and year of thinking but chickening out maybe soon it will be my time i attempted to swallow pill today and i think i m one getting really close now i hope i have the strength and courage one day to actually do it so i can finally rest and let go of this life i am tired,Depression
22405,I am doing better in the sense that I am too busy with school and parttime jobs to really dwell on my mental health issues. But it is all just so hopeless. I do not even want to be rich I just want to be comfortable. I can safely say that all the shit I have been through from childhood up to now can be traced back to money.I cannot even get a regular checkup without grimacing at the price let alone get therapy or meds which I desperately want to at least try. I live in a 3rd world country with no universal healthcare. It feels like my life will just be an endless cycle of chasing after deadlines and bills. it is impossible to catch up. My actual profession is grossly underpaid and my only hope is to wrack up enough experience to emigrate. And maybe that will keep me busy enough from really dwelling on my depression but I hope I do not look back on myself when I am old thinking I should have just killed myself then. I feel like I would.I am not actively suicidal anymore but I think that is how I will end up in the end. cannot kill myself now since us kids are practically my parent's insurance plan... Capitalism sucks. Realized that a lot of my issues come from financial instability. No matter how hard I work it will probably never get better than this.,Depression
24572,I think I learned an important lesson today that in order to really delve into emotions when trying to build a relationship and not play games that because disappointment and flashbacks of past sexrelated trauma the whole body shakes and breathing suffocates and you begin to get lost in past memories. Emotions that have not been healed appear and because a mess.And hell is taking over the body and it is already hard to think positive in this situation. And the pain is just unbearable Jesus tell me why I decided to go for that thin thread. Trigger trauma depression,Depression

38056,i am not sure if this is the right place for it but last friday one of my classmate told me jokingly to jump out of a window she ha been doing that joke for over a month i ve had it up to here so i said i d blow my head off on the weekend i tried to hurt myself and went to the emergency room on monday they prescribed me some lexapro and i went home relieved that i finally got some help half an hour after i returned home cop stormed my apartment saying they received a hint from the school that i wa gon na hurt myself and they searched my whole apartment for a gun which i don t have so they obv didn t find one and restrained me they then took me to the same hospital i wa at just half an hour ago and i spoke to the psychiatrist there again who told the police i am not a threat to myself or someone else so they let me go again during that they took my phone and it ran out of battery and i didn t have access to it for like hour or more during that time two of my classmate messaged me asking why i blocked them and they attacked me not knowing my phone ran out of battery and that s why i didn t answer they then blocked me and i explained to them on instagram what happened and they read it but didn t care apparently my classmate apparently told our headmaster they were worried and then he called the police i am getting the proper help from all of my teacher and my headmaster and i have an appointment with our school psychiatrist soon it s just that this whole police incident ha left me panicking and cry when i see a police officer car and everytime someone with heavy boot walk on my apartment floor i sit up thinking the police will come back again i also can t sleep properly and can t distract myself because i keep having horrible flashback of the scene when the police stormed in which leaf me breaking down it left me broken traumatized overwhelmed and desperate because i don t know what to do on top of that my classmate all blocked me are ignoring me and not even looking at me talking about being worried and not even one person asked me if i wa alright or how i wa doing i am considering going back to the emergency room and talking to the same psychiatrist from before but it s not really an emergency you know sorry if this text is long i am just overwhelmed and don t know what to do anymore all i know is i am traumatized a fuck and broken what should i do someone please assure me that everything is gon na be okay because at this point all my hope ha left me,Depression

23602,I am 20. I do not understand why I am alive to be honest. I do not have any intention of killing myself but I find it hard to care about anything these days. And from what I can tell life itself seems meaningless overall. Not to be nihilistic or anything but I genuinely see no reason to even keep going. Most of the time I do not feel anything besides meh. or I seem apathetic. I am content being alone and I am the kind of person who is happy as long as I have any kind of something around me to entertain myself with. As it currently stands my depression seems to have taken a nosedive. I have not showered in 3 days because I do not feel like it. We also do not have any hot water at the moment and so if I do shower I have to do it in the stupidest way possible and I do not even feel clean afterwards. Basically I was taught when this happens boil water mix it with some cool water pour it in sink and use a washcloth to wipe yourself down. Stupid and takes way more effort than a regular shower. And I do not feel like taking a cold shower. And I mean realistically if I died tomorrow nobody would notice for a long time. Not even work because I work minimum wage and they would just assume I would quit or something. My grandparents do not need me. My parents do not care where I am or what I am doing they are busy raising my siblings or getting high. it is been like that since I was a baby though. My grandparents would find my body if I were to die and probably be sad but I feel like that is only because of the fact they raised me. They would actually benefit if I was gone seeing as to how often they complain about how miserable their life currently is. How broke they are ect. I feel like I do not really exist except to make them happy because I am always their emotional support child. They argue and yell all the time. Just this morning my grandpa decided to start an argument because my grandma grabbed the wrong bowl. She said she wished she had never left my aunts houseShe went to visit last week and my grandpa said he wished she stayed too. Then of course she comes into my room crying then she makes my favorite meal then comes to announce that she made my favorite meal and then let us herself into my room to make my bed. This stuff is her way of trying to make herself feel better it is not out of genuine love I do not think. Because if I am in a bad mood and I do not immediately perk up it must be her fault and she will start crying even more. there is no escape from the negativity. I have to fake my happiness obviously because her feelings depend on mine. I hate it and there is no escape from the negativity.I mean I found roommates that hopefully I will be moving out with soon. But even then I am not sure life will get any better. Because I am pathetic enough that most people think there is something wrong with me and see me as a walking red flag. I am of course poor as well so you know add that onto it. But I have been saving up my money. I just do not know what to do with any of it. I have been saying I want to go to college but I have no idea what I want to do with my life. And I do not know why I would go to college yet I do not want to waste my money on something I might never use or might not even like. There are a lot of people out there who view me as a loser because I smoke weed play video games work and am not in college. To add onto that everyone acts like you should strive to better yourselfBut in my opinion I am not sure what I should better about myself. Or why. To make it so I am more tolerable to you? Because if I do not see you putting in the same effort why would I put in all the work so you can freeload? If that makes sense. I mean I am just here to vent at the moment. But I am not really upset. Or sad even. I am not sure what I am feeling but it is neither hopeless nor hopeful. I do not see a reason to keep going,Depression

47944,Does anyone feel like theyre on the edge of a cliff of being contenthappy and one small thing could make you fall off? Dont really know how to explain this further. Throughout my life Ive been tortured with medical issues and a dysfunctional family and so on and so fourth. This made me able to resist depression if that makes sense. I could essentially ignore it. I could force the happiness through and suppress anything else.Little things have made me happier than normal over the last five months including someone I thought was my friend until it became obvious that likely isnt the case. Before this I had entire fantastical and delusional ideas about what the next few months could look like between us.Things are getting worse between my family too and now Im dealing with a shitton more responsibilities that will likely be falling on me within a few months from now. That and this crumbling relationship only friendship and the farthest one has ever got for me are starting to push me to the end of the line. Im finding myself randomly breaking down more often and I feel like unless something drastic happens Ill explode.The best visual representation of this its fairly stupid and niche I know is a scene in Umbrella Academy 3 ep 7 trying not to spoil anything where a big problem was averted then this was celebrated and then the crisis comes back with more ferocity than before in an extremely short amount of time.,Depression
24933,Nobody hears me. Nobody understands me and nobody wants to try.. I get attached to stuff so easily and nobody understands why I do not know how to explain how I feel so I mess everything up. I just want to scream. I hate life. Sometimes I just want to scream..,Depression
19257,I know people post a lot here about Wellbutrin but through googling I have read many of the posts and nothing really rings true for my situation. I am on this like mental health journey trying to find what works for me and I do not really have anyone to talk to about it. I do not even have a family doctor lol. So here I am. I was on 150 XL for a month and I noticed a huge change at the start my main issue was focus and chronic fatigue but i found myself falling back to where I was at the end of the first month. Skip to the second month and my doctor kicks it into high gear and gives me 300 XL. The first few days I did not feel much of a change but after about a week or two holy fuck.I feel like I just slid into the side effects salon. For starters totally forget to eat. I already hate cooking and some days its not until 130 in the morning where I am like fuck got to sleep but did not eat. When I do eat its only a meal a day. I started a fitness plan and a nutrition plan with a trainer and the food is so fuckin bland I am just not interested I was 180 pounds before I started now I am 172. I am thinking of going back to some shittier foods so I regain some interest. My sex drive and everything related to sex has been cranked up to a million. Its probably the one thing I am struggling with the most. I am literally always horny and it shows lol which can be embarrassing. My brain is telling me to go pick up multiple guys off the street and bring them to bed and the last sliver of logic I have is the only thing stopping me.I am never sleepy. I can sleep but I am never actually like god I need to goto bed therefore I forget the time and stay up late often. It also feels like time is zooming by sometimes but idk if that is just me.Those are the major ones to list a few more I am warm and sweaty all the time social interactions feel bizarrely different I have gone from being super insecure to not being able to get away from a mirror dehydrated easier and I guess that is it off the top of my head.I am just curious what subsides and what stays? I understand Wellbutrin is not a miracle pill and its more of a trade one big problem for a little less significant and easier to deal with problems. Also if anyone wants to chat about it or are currently in the same spot with their treatmentare looking for support Id be happy to support and could also use some. Thanks ! Wellbutrin 150mg 300mg change,Depression
8050,Just as a gentle reminder when it comes to mental health At the top of their games and at the height of their powers Barry Sanders retired Rob Gronkowski took a break Michael Jordan took two breaks Calvin Johnson retired Naomi Osaka withdrew from the French Open Mike Krzyzewski took a breakleave midway through the 1995 season and did not come back until practice the next year. Andrew Luck retired at 29. Bjorn Borg retired with 11 Grand Slam titles at the age of 26.

Only constant defense. She does say the 3 words but only as answer never by herself. A few days ago she was texting a guy she met online... while I read going down on her... she thought I would not notice I guess. From an abusive mother who basically destroyed my soul to this.

I want to talk to them about it but do not have the courage.I am restoring my foreskin which helps but it is fucking stupid I have to do that. Why could not I have all the parts I was born with that were a part of MY body until someone mutilated me for no reason?I am 24 and should be focusing on life but I am too fucking distracted with the fact that I am genitally mutilated and everyone tells me I should be thankful and nobody gives a shit about how I feel. Fuck my parents who did this to me and fuck the doctor who did it.The only person who listens is my wife but I can tell she does not want to keep hearing about how I am depressed about it and it makes me feel like a burden.it is the one thing that makes me fucking hate my country. Fuck everyone who has ever done this to their kids and fuck society for making it okay. Anyone who is okay with it is a piece of shit and should burn in hell. Depressed I am circumcised,Depression

15357,I am honestly fucking struggling. I have some bearable days where my overthinking is not obsessive but I just do not know what to do anymore. I am on 5mg of Zyprexa 80mg of Prozac 20mg of Propranolol daily and recently started 10mg of Buspirone 2x a day. Also 1mg of Klonopin amp 20mg of Adderall as needed. I have been hospitalized 3 times. Inpatient psych first for psychosis had been severely stressed out and not sleeping due to an overwhelming job position so I was paranoid amongst other things. This first experience was less than traumatic than my last well get to that part eventually because I clearly have a lot to unpack. I spent about two weeks inpatient at a nice college unit where I rested and recovered from my one time episode. I went home and was very depressed and suicidal considering they had just taken me off of the Effexor I was on for a few months. I was paranoid and worried that my ex was out to get me and for some reason related a TV series to my own personal life and brought up some trauma that I previously did not unpack but made the mistake of doing it in an unsafe judgemental space. I broke up with him because I could not stand my feelings and I still fucking miss him to this day I went back in on the 31st of October of 2018. I felt unsafe and had my dad take me to the hospital. There I was at the same college inpatient unit for another 3 weeks where I had made some friends and started feeling ok. After that I went to a partial hospital program which was 5x a week morning to noon for a good 6 weeks. During that time I tried Zoloft which did not do shit apparently then moved on to Prozac and Wellbutrin was briefly on Risperidone my first hospitalization which made me lactate causing me to freak out which I clearly did not need at the time. After my second hospitalization I tried Abilify went to the partial hospital program again found a new therapist so on and so fourth. My third hospitalization started June 2020 I was tazed in my bathtub where I had went to hide when 4 police cars showed up because my father could not contain me. I had not slept in 3 days and was paranoid handcuffed and held down by 3 police officers and had my legs shackled. They sedated me when I got to the hospital and all I remember is trying to stretch my legs and being unable to because of the foot cuffs. I felt helpless and humiliated I had no pants on and my entire building was outside when this was happening. Some asshole neighbor of mine even took a video of the whole fucking fiasco but denies it to this day. I still have a lot of trauma to unpack and have struggled with finding a therapist. I have had a few and i just do not get shit through my thick head. I am fucking blabbering but I am desperate and leaving to my parents country tomorrow to get clean off weed because all I do is smoke to escape my feelings. I am suicidal as fuck and live for the life and love of my parents and sister. I am desperate for any insight thought or anything. I am losing my shit dude I sound insane but I do not ducking care 22F MDDampGAD Hopeless.,Depression
12860,My doctor just prescribed me effexor XR but I am afraid of taking it because of the literature out there worsening of cognitive functions weight gain increased probability of suicide etc. I understand it is something that is possible with all medication but I am really scared of taking this I did not feel that way about my previous meds like citalopram. Is there something wrong with my thinking? Has anyone taken this and seen positive effects? Afraid to take medication,Depression

17105,idek if this is the right place to talk about this. my therapy contract is expiring soon so i feel more pressured to pretend I am doing better. I am really not and I am scared. i do not have any older adults i trust to ask for advice and i do not want to talk to a counselor from school.I am currently studying pharmaceutical sciences. it sucks bc I am not that interested in it but my parents were proud i got the offer. the thing is i keep having nightmares where i secretly synthesize drugs and take them to end my life. I have been hospitalized for overdosing several times before and just overdosed again several days ago. when i get strong suicide urges i almost always turn to overdosing on my medications. i have no idea what to do tho. idk what i want in life i just know its not whatever it is I have got going on rn. so I am not sure if i should switch my degree or just hope that I will be better a few years from now. i feel so lost and scared and all this stress really is not helping i think I am getting worse and I am scared of where I am headed,Depression
48022,Need advice I've done a lot of horrible things to people in my past. I'm a pathological liar that has constantly manipulated people to make sure either myself or the other person didn't get hurt at least in the moment. I've used people and thrown them out like trash after I was done. I've dealt with ADHD anxiety and depression for over a decade now.My ex and I broke up almost 7 years ago. It was a horribly messy and terrible break up that caused me to be suicidal we both made mistakes. There was never any closure and it always felt like it should have ended differently. It often felt like she felt the same as well...at least back then think she might resent me now.Been having some real down moments lately and I've been thinking about my ex a lot. I'm still attached to those days and emotionally often feel stuck there. There's still a giant piece of me that belongs to her.I've been in a fairly healthy relationship for the past 5 years but I have quite a few things I lied about in the early parts of our relationship. I feel like it's so unfair to her. It's not fair that I'm with her and emotionally stuck with my past or that I've lied to her. It's not fair that the thing I desperately want to talk about is my ex so I avoid that trauma with her.Any advice or thoughts?,Depression
47148,Got laid off and can't even enjoy the free time My friends are telling me to travel or do fun things while I hear back from the jobs I've applied to but how can I? I'm anxious about not having a paycheck. I have no drive to do anything other than apply to jobs. I have all this free time now and even when I can't focus on job applications I'm too depressed to do anything I would actually enjoy. Well I still enjoy doing yoga so not all is bleak but that's pretty much all I have the energy to do.I've lost all the creativity and passion I used to have for making art and my friends are all still working full time so I don't really have anyone to hang out with until they get out of work. I know I'm going to regret this time once I'm back to working full time and having limited time off but I don't know how to experience joy right now.,Depression
14885,I am a liar for telling people stuff like oh I promise not to be late anymore or I promise to do better in school or I promise Ill hang out with you soon and promise Ill stop behavior that comes from me wanting to die when in reality I am too depressed to really care and I am lying to myself by trying to convince myself life is worth living when I know damn well its not and I am struggling to even stay alive much less improve myself or take care of myself or respect myself I feel like I am lying by acting as if I want to continue to live,Depression

25349,Alright so i am 20 yo and i feel like i have wasted my life and not enjoyed as much as i should this covid situation keeping us home is not helping at all i want to go out and enjoy life with friends and i feel like i only have 1 or 2 years left until professional life starts i am a lil depressed so i just to know is it like common to think like that or is it only me?Have you been through such thoughts? If yes what do you have to say about it? I am supposedly living the best days of my life!,Depression
12810,I am a 15 year old male i recently came home drunk and my mom caught me.I have been depressed for like half a year now but I have never managed to tell my parents i do not know why but its just hard to talk about i guess.when i got home my mom asked if i was drunk. I denied it. She then asked to smell my breath and she knew instantly. She had alcoholic parents growing up so she is good at knowing when somebody is drunk. She also went through my bag and found snus which is a kind of tobacco product.So i started crying and told her i needed help and that i was depressed. She said that she could help with that and get me a therapist. I was actually kind of relived that she caught me so i could finally get help. I was grounded for a few days and then went to my dads house the next week. And I have been back at moms house two times now for a week at a time. I think its been 3 weeks scince this.But my problem is that my mom has not said a thing about me being depressed and all that after that night. So I am not getting any help. Its not that she is a bad person and that she does not care. She is herself suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome so she is having a hard time.I think she might think it was an excuse for getting drunk. But now its back like it was before i cannot het myself to bring it up again.What should i do? What should i do?,Depression
16455,that is it. I just want to all emotions genuinely. I feel so hollow inside and all I have is my loneliness and sadness. I just want to genuinely connect with people with no faking everything. I JUST WANT TO FEEL LIKE WHAT IT FEELS TO BE LIKE THE OTHERS JUST FOR ONE TIME. that is all I ask. I just want to smile and laugh genuinely,Depression

21596,Everyone talks about loving themselves these days and if you do not you are just not good enough and nobody wants you that literally what they say say you want a relationshipfriends and they tell you to love yourself first because nobody wants to be around a ''Debbie downer''People do not want true human connections they want people who fulfill roles like a best friend or wife like it is a fucking job they do not care about how others feel only how others make them feel.it is frustrating trying to be the perfect fucking human everyday because unless you are perfect people see you as worthless.. Why does everyone seem to hate insecure or depressed people?,Depression

9621,I have made several post in this group. I have made it quite clear that I suffer from depressive thoughts and suicidal thoughts its true. I hate myself so much. I do not even wish I was different anymore. I wish I was dead. My whole life I have been treated like a pile of dirt. By my family peers and so called friends surprisingly I do not hate anyone else. Just myself. I have heard the saying every teenager goes through a phase like I am going through hundreds of times since I tried to let people know what I am going through mentally. No one believes me. I lost my faith in god since he never helped me out when I needed it. I do not believe in an afterlife anymore. what is wrong with me? My brain is coated with a fog that prevents me from thinking straight. I now have very bad memory too. I eat much more now and I cannot keep friendships. Maybe I am just bad luck what is wrong with me,Depression
40113,cliche i know but my girlfriend left me we had been together for about and a half year our anniversary wa coming up in july when we met i wa depressed and had been planning suicide she pulled me out of that and gave me purpose and happiness now that she s gone i realize i ve been living my life for her and now that i m alone i don t know what to do with myself i have no other want than her and it feel like she s the only person or thing that can make me happy again i ve lost all interest in my hobby and i have no motivation for school which i only started so i could make money for the family i had dreamed we would have i feel like i m right back where i wa when she met me alone and depressed with no motivation and no desire to continue,Depression
47543,Ever felt like you don't want anything in life Everyday I repeat myself doing the same shit again n again. I don't know whats going on inside my brain I can see its functioning like a system doing its thing but I clearly don't know what its doing and why im stuck inside it. Made me curious but I started thinking what if there is only one voice behind every person or any living thing on this planet like there is one spirit just experiencing itself of its variant energies in its own creation of all forms of life on this planet and that we are all one but part of the play. how do I stop my consciousness its painful to be awake in our sleep we don't know where we go also forget we even have a body and that there is consciousness. literally what am I thinking about. anyway all this seems like a dream but the game is running slow one day the battery will drain out and I will finally experience the real me which i think is pure awarenessconsciousness of infinite energy,Depression
47583,Relapse Prevention I was struggling with depression for years and I got out of it by going to therapy making lifestyle choices and shifting into a mindset of i deserve taking care of myself. I still had a lot of anxiety and insecurity but I could at least moderately function and feel joy and happiness. I'm feeling myself slip back into depression partially due to a lack of fulfillmentaccomplishment at my job a long with realizing that I'm not living up to my very high expectations on a personal level. Any tips for not falling in the hole? I know that every day I don't do anything about it will make it so much harder to get back to a normal level of functioning.,Depression
15170,Today seemed like a nice day the weather is good for once and I felt okay. Being in Home Office I started my day as usual and got to work. After a few exhausting hours and 10 Minutes before a deadline my boss realized that I made a mistake and she quickly fixed it herself.And what can I say I feel like an absolute useless piece of shit who cannot get anything right. She told me in a nice way and was not even mad but still I feel like a total failure. And knowing it is nothing important and that it still gets me to the point I am crying my eyes out I ask myself will it ever stop? Will it ever get better? I am in therapy since a few weeks but so far I do not see any progress and maybe I am too harsh with myself I cannot help it to think that I will never be fixed again.Sorry I just had to rant about this whole situation thank you for reading. Feeling like a failure,Depression

20373,So many things are wrong I thought I could deal with it all but I also thought life would get better and it just does not bad news after bad news after bad news when is this going to stop? I cannot take it anymore. How much can a person endure before loosing hope? I know life is not easy and I know people have it way worse but I just cannot. I do not know if I am depressed but life keeps throwing shit at me and I do not know if I am able to take it anymore.,Depression
14262,...but only when you get it.it is becoming more and more frustrating with anything that I do there is always something negative people need to interject with. Never constructive. it is to the point where even small things are bothering me and that is becoming an issue. The biggest thing that gets me are these attitudes of X does it better so you are invalid or Y has it worse so you are invalid. It really makes you feel small and like a nobody.Time and time again I will try something again and it just ends up in the same place. Nobody genuinely cares which is why I rarely bother anymore to reach out and express things. I am in this alone and just need to deal with it I suppose. When there is nobody to advocate for you you just need to do it yourself. it is very hard to pick yourself up when you are in a tough spot.Am I letting the negative win? For now yes and I hate that. I really wish things could be different sometimes. Living a happier life will come in time I hope. Thanks for stopping by whoever you may be out there Positive Reinforcement Goes a Long Way,Depression
16059,I wish I was not born human but rather an animal.Animals do not have to pay bills or slave their life just to gather enough money to retire and travel. Animals are not stressed about payments. They are free to explore and live as they please. Yeah they have predators but I would still rather fear that then my future of my mundane life.Not only that but screw people. When a bear or tiger sees you you know it is intentions It wants to eat you. When you see a deer you know it wants nothing to do with you. With people you never know their true intentions. People are more cruel then animals. Yes there are a few good people in this world but it is the equivalent of swimming in poop while rarely finding a diamond.Animals also usually do not experience anxiety or depression. Most cases of them having those illnesses is because of being in captivity by humans. I wish I was not born human.,Depression

8920,Hi I am new to Reddit and this is my first vent post so this might be a little long and all over the place. I just wanted to rant about some things I have been feeling lately. Any nice comments would be appreciated. I am a sophomore in college and a student athlete my sport being swimming. My first year was the worst I have ever performed and I am scared that Ill never amount to anything. I feel like I am steadily declining and losing the only thing I have been successful at my whole life. I used to be really great at what I do and really respected and now I am fucking pathetic. All of my efforts each day do not do shit and I have not improved or made any progress at all. If I cannot do well at something I literally dedicate my entire life to all that tells me is that Ill never be good at anything and Ill just be mediocre my whole life. Nothing special. A worthless pathetic loser. I just want to die but I know Id never actually have the guts to kill myself. It feels like suicidal thoughts are always in my head though. I have tried hurting myself recently but I was too afraid to go any further. I am so obsessed with my weight and I cannot look in the mirror without wanting to rip myself apart. I fucking hate myself. So much shit is going on in my head that I cannot even begin to try and deal with it so I spend most of my time laying in bed consuming 5 different forms of media at the same time so I do not have any time to think. there is so much going on and so much I feel is wrong with me but I do not really know what it is. I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I feel like the shit I deal with is more than that. But my whole life my parents would always tell me that I overreact about everything and that I just needed to toughen up and be a big girl. I cannot even trust myself and my own feelings anymore. I do not understand anything and I am so tired of my mind being like this. I do not know what to do or how to help myself anymore. I just want to give up. I feel stuck in this deep hole and have no hope of getting myself out of it.,Depression
22944,Its sad but its a fact. If it was not for video games I would have taken my own life ages ago. Its the only thing I have tbh only thing that keeps me genuinely happy. All the upcoming games makes me excited and happy and makes me want to continue living to be able to experience them. Only thing that is keeping me alive is gaming,Depression
12501,Does anybody else experience this? Almost every time I get good news I do not celebrate. Yesterday I got accepted to a yoga teacher training program. I think it will help keep me accountable and provide a much needed community to me. I think it will be a good thing. But upon hearing the news I went kind of numb. Its like since its real then the real work of it all becomes real too? It sort of feels like just another task looming in the future. What about you? Have you had similar experiences? Happy things feel like sad things,Depression
7093,Lockdown has been extended for another four weeks until the end of August for me. It sucks I miss socialising and trying to enjoy the few things that bring me joy in life. Unfortunately it has to be done and hopefully will not be much longer. Until then I am downdepressed laying in bed all day with nothing to do and just being miserable. Lockdown depression.,Depression

24795,I am considering checking myself into the ER for ideation. I have had it really rough for whatever reason the past few weeks and I have been seriously thinking about suicide for several days now but I am afraid that if I check myself in they would lock me in some institution and scramble my brains with drugs. I guess I am looking for other experiences so I can accurately determine what I should do. Thanks. Experiences with the ER?,Depression
13490,Every morning I wake up and am crushed by the fact I am alone in the world. I then get high enough to tolerate existence and search through a dozen or so sitesapps looking to see if I got any replies from the people I had messaged the day before. Almost always every inbox is empty and it is a waste of time.I then tell myself to get to work. But I do not I lament my empty life of failures browse dating websites try to engage interest and attract strangers because I have already failed endless times with the people I know. I tell myself to exercise as though that is the key to someone finally wanting me. No one even talks to me they never get to a point they see me with my shirt off it does not matter if I get ripped. So I cannot keep the motivation to exercise because I know it is useless. I cannot get a first date muscles do not matter if no one ever sees them.And exercise for my health? I want to die. I am just too cowardly to do it myself. Might as well do it the slow way. Might as well pick up a drug habit I have the money and the lack of will to live.My energy is constantly low it saps through the day and I just collapse into bed. Sleep for about 10 minutes before my physical and mental discomfort make me get back up. I do this about a half dozen times a day sleeping for about ten minutes a stretch sometimes sleeping a few hours. I do not really do full nights of sleep ever since my cat died.I have always been a terrible sleeper but when she curled up on my chest and made me feel like I was not alone I could finally rest. But now I am alone there is no rest. there is just constant turmoil.My mind stays in an endless fog. My thoughts have become increasingly incoherent increasingly cynical increasingly angry increasingly malevolent. Without someone to love I am becoming monstrous. All this love in my heart turns to rage I burn bridges attack anyone who bothers me even slightly and of course become a burdensome ranting idiot that makes the few people who still tolerate me not want to tolerate me anymore. I should have killed myself the day my cat died. Only a creature reliant on me for food and comfort could possible love me to the extent I need to function. A human has never wanted to have that level of closeness with me and likely never will.Six years since I had any family.Four years since someone has touched me sexually.A little over a year since my cat my only reason to keep trying to exist in this shitty world died.I have been going on with no reason to live for over a year. I do not know that I can do it much longer and there is no sign of anything changing in my future. This is all just more melodramatic horseshit that no one's going to read. Just writing it for catharsis because I have no other way to release stress. I do not really get a cathartic feeling from these rants anymore though it is more just a sampling of my daily mental deterioration. Yet another generic depressing rant.,Depression
18638,I am currently 5 months pregnant with my first. I have dealt with depression and anxiety for years but this is just horrendous. I barely know what to say here but this is a last ditch effort for advice and validation. I have ADHD and my executive dysfunction has just been so terrible the past few weeks. It goes to a point where there are days that I put off peeing because I just cannot get myself out of bed. I cannot shower or brush my teeth. My partner is amazing and I love him but I just feel like such a burden to everyone right now. I know I need a therapist but I just cannot get myself to find one who takes my insurance. I cry every day. I feel so heavy and sad but numb at the same time. Help. I am so depressed. I am pregnant and everyone says its just because I am pregnant and its making it worse. Please give kind gentle advice if possible.,Depression

15552,My depression has made my family hate me. I no longer enjoy doing things with them and they say I am negative all the time. I try I really do try to be positive but its just so hard nigh on impossible for someone as depressed as I am. I guess I fake it well enough that they think I am well enough. I just feel hopeless and alone. Nothing makes me happy anymore except for my dog and buying stuff for him. But whenever I buy stuff for him or talk about him and how much I love him I get shot down by my family. They want me to be positive about certain things but other things not so much only if it fits their agenda. They want me to be positive about everything and honestly although I know I am extremely depressed and borderline suicidal I do not think that being positive all the time is a healthy mindset either. I just do not know how to impress them anymore. I do not want to be super fake all the time because its exhausting and annoying but I have tried my best to be positive and they cannot handle that either. I hate to disappoint them but I am driving them all crazy. Maybe its time to end it all and make them stop being annoyed with me. Family just cannot understand my pain,Depression
17901,i hate livingi hate waking up everyday going to work for 40 hours a week to make jack shiti hate that i cannot even look forward to my relationship because we both get off at 530 and were both too tired to do much and then we have to go home and sleep and do it all over again. how am i supposed to be happy with this life when i have nothing to be happy for? and when i tell someone that i do not want to wake up anymore they tell me that everyone does not like to work you do not have it that hardjust keep fighting and look to the future. if you were in my head you would know that its not that easy its not that easy to look to the future and suck it up I am tired of waking up to slave away for rich peopleI am tired of being numb and broken inside and not having time for myself for my relationshipI am tired of being made to feel like I am over reacting and i should not feel this way i do not want to keep doing this,Depression

15841,So I am 20 years old and I havnt been in a good mental place for a long time. I spend as much time as I can alone just because going out with friends and seeing them happy just makes me mad that I cannot be like that no matter what I try. For the longest time I have experienced a whole bunch of sexual problems ie. cannot get it up have never came from any type of sex and have no sex drive at all. Recently I have started to realize that I think the root of my unhappyness has something to do with this. My testosterone is pretty low for a guy my age but not low enough to where I could go on any therapy for it.I just sort of wanted to ask any guys or girls if they have the same issues? Like I feel like if I could do something about not being able to have sex I would be so much happier all around. Root of problems,Depression

14368,my girlfriend has always had some form of anxiety and depressive episodes. she hates the way she looks and refuses to leave the house due to public other people just give her panic attacks etc so I am also unable to see her. she also refuses to tell anyone as she sees herself as a burden a waste of time and thinks it is embarrassing. I love her n want the best for her so I know she needs help but it is hard to get it her when she somewhat refuses. I do not know what she suffers from its clearly a form of anxiety I assume but what else does this sound like and any solutions to any of these problems are welcomed my girl is not okay,Depression
22091,Ive always struggled to make sense of job nonsense but i usually was able to withstand bullsht at the job not anymore. i feel like the lack of motivation and just fatigue overall drained me to a point where i can no longer work. the past 2 years have been hell on earth job hopping all over. i got 2 kids and a wife. when covid started i struggled to make ends meet due to jobs so we got evicted now a year later my symptons have gotten worse medication does not work. I have been taking adderall to help with adhd and motivation but thats not helping either im 2 months behind rent now and landlord is sending threats of eviction such as i suggest you pay me this weekend. I have applied for state assistance and the local city assistance but they just keep asking for more documents and the help never comes. they even sent an email saying my proof of income was invalid it was actually my wifes proof of income because i really do not have any to show for... well the main reason I am behind on rent is precisely because of lack of income so that is the reason I am asking for assistance its kind of a paradox so here i stand planning my suicide in agony 26 years have gone in my life and there has never been stability anytime. 26 years of pure suffering. Called the suicide hotline for the first time today and all they could offer was try going for a walk or listening to music. Unable to work? Am i depressed or really just a lazy POS?,Depression

19738,Hey guys i just want to vent out. It is my final year of high school and there was this competition in our maths class where we had to come up with real life solutions using maths so i did an alternative method of launching payload which took me months to do but other classmate just copied a covid problem from the net and presented the teacher who was supposed to select students for the competition picked the other student even though she said i presented better and i spoke better but they have covid releated problem so they get to participate instead. This is just one case this is happening throughout my school life. I cannot even say i lost a competition i never got chance to even loose. Just months of hardwork wasted again and again and again. I am done with this plus being called the n word and being constantly being made fun of due to my skin i have no confidence in my appearance and today was the last straw which took out a little bit of self esteem i had of my mind. Guess i am just rambling on at this point but if you r reading this iust know you r the person i have talked most in the past few years so thanks for listening. Goodbye Loser,Depression

11113,I do not want anyone to care about me I do not want to do anything with my life I do not want to do anything. I just want to sit with my cat eat and rot on my couch or bed. I hate it when people ask me how I am I hate showering I hate doing anything that is not eating gaming or watching tv. I hate going outside I hate talking to people. I am autistic too making socializing and understanding people even MORE difficult. I fucking hate it when I hear people saying that being autistic or depressed is a gift. NO IT is not. if I could be anything I would be ducking neurotypical. I literally cannot understand people and makes life SO HARD. All my friends end up leaving me too and making friends is even harder than keeping friends. I physically cannot talk about anything that does not interest me. I do not want help I just want to be left alone. Just want to be left alone,Depression

15954,so I am 20 yr old and I have a 24 yr old sister and my father is pretty strict. I mean he is strict in general with all three of us me my brother and sister and i understand that it is bc he is trying to protect as from the unfairness and corruption that is in the world. but he is extra strict on my sister especially since she is a girl. for example he does not allow her to go out with her friends even though they are only girls because he thinks that girls should not go out alone since he does not trust the people and what will they do. also having a boyfriend is outside of the question and he does not care if he makes a scene outside of the house when something is wrong and because of all of this she lost a lot of her friends and started being lonely and depressed.now if I am being fair to him my grandparents was twice as strict and he was treated much harsher than us since that was the mentality back in the 60s70s and that was just he was raised. and amid all of this I try to help all I can and I always hear her out whenever she needs to in addition I always try to convince her to talk to him but she refused the idea and said that she will resent me forever if I ever talked to him behind her back and I think she is being serious about it. so now I am in a difficult position where I cannot do anything but watch as her hatred grows each day while having nothing to do to stop it. and it is starting to eat me up inside bc I do not want my family to fall apart. hell my hands are shaking typing this just from the idea of what could happen if we do not solve this problem.so as conclusion. if anyone has any tips then please help me...I am starting to lose my shit here.0 CommentsShareEdit PostSaveHide I a 24 yr sister with a parent that is strict on her that she started developing depression bc of that and began claiming that she does not have a father. what should i do to help?,Depression
26187,So some back story my sister has always been my best friend. We have both struggled with mental health our whole lives and while I am starting to balance out she seems to keep getting worse and worse. We had been loving together with me supporting her with maintaining the household cleaning and it exhausted me. I got to the point where I no longer see her as my friend and it hurts.... I am at a loss with her she does not seem to want to get to get better will not take responsibility for the stressors she puts on herself ex. She wants to emotional spend and then cannot afford bills and needs help. The most recent thing happened was she is not a clean person and she never has been. I moved out of the house and across the state. I recently went back and walked into what can only be described as a pre hoarders situation. I fed her cats and one did not come down. I was genuinely concerned it might have died in the mess. I finally broke down and sent a picture of her bedroom to my mom. I finally told her that I failed her and could not keep up with my sister. I did not how else to help her. My dad reached out and apparently told her to either clean up or move out.The house was owned by my parents and I was taking care of it for them while they were out of the country. I went back this weekend and her room looked a ton better. My sister however told me if I ever tattled again then she would go no contact. I respect her decision but how do I show her that being supportive is not always coddling? That I want her to get better but I am at a loss for it. I have tried helping her clean suggesting different coping methods and she always replies that she is too depressed to do anything about it. I just feel like she is perpetuating her own condition and it is breaking my heart. I am one step away from going no contact because it is hurting me so much. I know that this would not be the answer because of her health. I just feel like such a failure. I am about to lose my sister,Depression
37895,im y o my mom died when i wa 9 and ever since then ive had no motivation to do anything i used to be into sport a lot football baseball basketball track and i wa pretty good at it too but ever since my mom passed i just cant seem to be happy fr people always ask me why i gave up why my grade went down why im not how i wa year ago when i go to school im a pretty popular person and i d like to think im a pretty funny person and fun person to be around but when i get home im alone just me and my thought and it literally killing me ive thought about killing myself multiple time and im sure the only reason i haven t is because i couldn t put my father through that please give me some type of advice i honestly dont think i can do this any longer amp x 00b i posted this under a different subreddit about two week ago i took the advice people gave to me and it didint work everything just feel like it wont get better no matter how hard i try i genuinely feel like there no escape and that killing myself is the best option people always say oh you need to do what would make your mother happy okay and what about what make me happy i wan na play sport again so badly but my dad to scared to let me because he doesn t want me to lose sight in my other eye to be honest football basketball and baseball where some of the only thing that made me happy and now that i cant play them it just make everything worse i just miss my mom she wa the only person that made me happy really and i really didnt even get that much time with her,Depression
15724,I feel like everything nice and fun just ceases to exist. it is like it is my fault that I am trying too hard to be happy and everything gets worse.My few and only best friends are toxic and manipulative bringing up stuff from years ago that they know make me feel guilty. My parents are abusive and give me little to no privacy wanting my exact location and email password and forcing me in social situations knowing that they make me uncomfortable just so I get used to it.My favorite game is being put on fucking live support Youtube videos are boring and uninteresting just everything that I used to pass the time is unbearable.None of the pathetic little projects I start do not go anywhere because it is hard to do anything at this point.And I feel guilty that I have brought all of this on myself by being an awful person my whole life. Do I deserve this? Have I made others' lives miserable and I just did not know? Am I annoying? Insufferable? I feel guilty when someone is doing something and I am just too tired to help.Maybe my friends are not toxic nor my parents nor is anything bad happening. Maybe I am toxic complaining about my miniscule problems that nobody gives a shit about. Maybe. I hope not.The only thing I have going for me is that I recently found this person they seem very nice and I wish we can be friends but we have talked for 2 days about an hour per day and I already fear she will reject me because I kind of think she is just being nice to a stranger and because I think I blew it by saying I actually have nothing to say it is just nice to talk to you. For me it seems desperate. Maybe I am desperate. Everything good just disappears from my life,Depression
20876,I have been cleaning out my camera roll today and I keep seeing photos Id taken of myself. Fun selfies little videos with my favorite songs outfits that made me feel good. I cannot remember the last time I did that. I cannot remember the last time I looked at myself and wanted to keep looking. I have always struggled with how I view my body gender dysphoria plus body dysmorphia but it makes me really sad that things started to get better then got so bad again. I was not doing well at all mentally but at least I had that. I do not know how to express all of how this is making me feel but its not good. I wish I could go back in time and hug my past self. The 7 yo old stepping on his mothers scale. The 10 yo shaving his arms because someone said they were too hairy. The 12 yo getting migraines every day because someone made fun of his glasses.The 14 yo wearing two bras and getting up hours before school to cake on makeup praying that being a pretty enough girl would fix things. The 16 yo hacking up blood and still feeling fat at 80 lbs. Every version of myself deserved better. They deserved so much love from themselves and the people in their lives. I realized I have stopped taking photos of myself again.,Depression

11898,Has anyone been institutionalised for depression? I am struggling a lot and fear for my life but getting hospitalised scares me so much I feel I would only feel worse and more of a failure after it. Can anyone share some insight? What is it like to get institutionalised?,Depression
19193,I feel like with every week I get more and more confused about my emotions and feelings.I mean my mood can sometimes get better and it feels so uncomfortable. but it is more uncomfortable because I feel like I am taking depression because my mood is not in the worst state. that is classicbut lately I felt like I cannot even think about anything depressing or something. When I try to think of what I think of myself there is nothing. When I just try to say to myself I am worthless I honestly do not know if I even agree. I do not know why I would think of myself as worthless. And when I give myself reasons it still does not feel right. But the problem is it does not even work the other way around. I cannot think of any good thing about me. I am just confused. I feel like I do not know myself.And today I woke up with the feeling that I want to kill myself for some reason I wanted that feeling to come but I cannot find any reason why I would want to kill myself. I just want to kill myself because I can or because I should. And because of the lack of reason I do not feel like killing myself.I honestly feel like I want to kill myself but my mind is trying desperately to save me.But I do not want to. I just feel that I should be dead.Or... I do not even know what I feel or what I should feel. I am just a vessel with so many emotions inside that they combined into something. You cannot even tell what emotions it was made of and you just do not understand it.I do not understand myself. I want to kill myself but do not know why,Depression
19000,are you a highly motivated self starter? .... no not at all in any way...everi know you are supposed to just lie and no one is really like that but reading this kind of stuff over and over is so depressing. having to think about starting a new job and trying hard and meeting new people and getting interviewed and rejected. I am so tired and i have not even applied anywhere job hunting is so difficult,Depression

17842,I am done with life. i want to kill myself. so badly. its very weird typing this because I have never told anyone about it even though it is all i can think about. i fucking hate everything. i hate my friends i hate being so lonely all of the goddamn time. i hate my best friend for dating the person I have had a crush on. but i have to suck it up because i do not even like them anymore and my best friend is all i have. you are a piece of shit. you broke my trust. i say that idc but it hurts so fucking bad. its so stupid I am so stupid i should be dead.

I am done,Depression
7300,my brother has not spoken to our mother in over 10 years and he just started speakingtexting to me again after ghosting me for 3 years. I was listening to music and a song came on that always made me think of our family situation. I did not think he would even listen or reply but he did and he sent me back a song that must have been on his heart with the situation and knowing that is how he feels breaks my heart. Growing up we were abused. When he would be the one on the receiving end of the abuse it always broke me to see my big strong charismatic athletic brother have such a deep sadness but the kind you can only recognize if you have felt the same way. No tears or screaming..just brokenness. I have recovered from my childhood very well considering. However that small interaction with my brother the other day has really brought back a lot of feelings. I adore my brother while on the other hand I have made the decision to forgive our mother and that is something that will always put a strain on our relationship. We went from being so so close to now me having a 2.5yo he is never even met even though I have invited him many times. He also agreed to come meet her on her birthday and canceled 20min before he was supposed to be here. He told me that the only way he feels like he can be okay is to be independent and prove to himself he does not need anyone. Me on the other hand feels like in order for me to be okay i need to hug my brother and tell him i love him and see him be an uncle to my baby so basically I have been crying since monday and thinking about how i do have unresolved anger towards our mom and maybe i need to talk to her about how i feel but I have felt fine with everything for awhile until finding out how hurt my brother still is a vent post triggering convo w brother,Depression
17235,I am 33 and have had 2 major depressive episodes since college where my depression first became an issue. Both episodes followed an almost identical pattern I am doing exceptionally well and my selfesteem is at a high point.Leading up to the first episode Id just received my first ever promotion since starting my professional career and Id won a pretty significant local award for my art. Leading up to the second episode Id just received huge promotion at work and had spent the Covid lockdown on a major self improvement kick. I got into the best shape of my life visible 6 pack for the 1st time in years! learned to cook well did a home teeth whitening kit bought a bunch of new clothes etc. I meet a girl who I am really attracted to and we hit things off immediatelyIn both cases these were women who I met organically IRL instead of through online dating. We clicked immediately and started spending a lot of 11 time together and texting daily. I get rejectedThe first girl initially accepted my dinner invitation without hesitation but then texted me a few hours later to say that she was intrigued by me but still had strong feelings for her ex. They did end up getting back together within weeks and dating for a while.The second current girl told me that her life was upside down right now. she would just moved across the country to a new city where I was the only person she knew our parents are friends but wed only met once before she moved here. She gave me a spiel about how Id be lying if I said I had not thought about it and If you were just someone I met at a bar or on Bumble but that I am literally her emergency contact and the only stable trusted friend she has here. My self esteem plummets from alltime highs to rock bottomMy internal monologue changes overnight from you are crushing it! to a constant stream of You were stupid to think a girl like that would ever want you you will never be happy you should just kill yourself I am not going to but its an intrusive thought that pops up a lot.All of my friends are getting engagedmarried and buying homes with their significant others and my dating life pretty much consists of sleeping with women I do not even like just to feel less alone. I just want more than anything to be with someone who I am actually excited to be with. The thing that triggers my depressive episodes is also the thing I need if I am ever going to be happy,Depression
26817,okay so I am writing this bc i feel like i have no one else to talk to about this and I am not really quite sure what exactly I am feeling right now. So I keep thinking to myself I want to die. This usually happens when I am really anxious or just very sad about a situation. I do not think I could ever actually end my life or really even cut myself. I just keep having these thoughts that I wish I was not alive. I am wondering if this is suicidal thoughts or no. I have this issue where I think that my problems are not that bad and that I could be worse off. I do not want to hear things like please do not you have so much to live for because I already know it would not be a smart idea and I seriously do not think I am to that point where I want to harm myself. Its so hard for me to express my emotions and let people know how I am really feeling and I do not know how to stop this. Idk anything helps at this point i do not know my feelings,Depression

48110,Why can't my mom see that I'm depressed? HelloI've been having this issue for years now and it seems to make everything worse than it should be. I've been trying to reach out for help for 7 years now I'm 21 now. I've been trying to tell my mom what's happening telling her why I can't seem to get out of bed for days on end sometimes telling her that I need help and everytime the conversation happens it feels like she finally gets what I'm saying. She never does. Everytime she gets upset at me she asks why I'm always in bed why a person my age is always tired and never really doing anything or going anywhere and Everytime it just makes me feel both worse and insane. I've straight up told her that I've thoughtattempted suicide before and all she had to say was oh really? in a tone that suggested that I didn't have it hard enough to do that. I don't understand why she keeps doing this why she keeps asking me what's wrong when I've told her a thousand times. It's making me feel like I'm making everything up that I'm going crazy. If anyone went through something like this and has some tips or anything that could help please please tell me. I don't know what to do at this point I genuinely don't know what to do anymore.,Depression

10702,i feel like I am fully aware of what is going on and i do not like it. i want to live my life just like any other human being. i do not want to constantly focus on the past or the future. i do not want to feel stressed out thinking about what I will do in 10 years from now. i do not want my life to consist of going to work and coming back home. it is a cycle that repeats itself everyone lives the same life just as different people with different perspectives. each one of us go to school get a job get married or whatever and then die. i do not want to do this it feels so wrong and so ordinary i do not want to live like this i do not want to work my ass off just to die in the end. everyone tells me to enjoy my teenage years but I am over here with 0 irl friends and 4 mental illnesses parents on the verge of getting a divorce. everything feels so meaningless i do not think i have a purpose or will ever have one. i want to feel loved but i always get hurt because guys my age are just so immature. older guys have different desires and we are just not compatible. everyone expects me to be strong at all times but sometimes i just want to be able to cry and have someone hold me and tell me everything will be alright. i feel so incomplete and nothing is enough to fill the void in me that is growing bigger everyday. i cannot live like this i cannot live with myself for 50 more years. i do not want people to perceive me or have a version of me in their head. i do not want them to have expectations of me. i do not want to feel responsible to keep them happy and satisfied. everything is so hard i wish someone would understand. i feel like people only talk to me out of pity or just to ask for nudes. i dislike myself so much. i try to be nice and kind towards others but I am harsh on myself. I am so tired i do not think this life is worth it i know I am still young but it is already so draining. i wish my parents cared a little. or just showed that they do. i immediately regret it when i vent to someone about something because i feel like they only listen to me because I am their friend and they will just move on with their lives once I am done. i wish my mom would hug me. I am only 16,Depression
8340,Male in my mid going on later 30s. As context i spent my 20s dating and then pining after the one that got away who was my only girlfriend thus far. Then i let myself go and got really obese and just did not think about relationships for a while. I have tried improving myself I make a six figure income i travel the world i dropped the weight so I am no longer obese. Paid for microneedling to remove acne scars.. and nothing despite trying every dating app. I even went on sites like SA to see if i could pay for companionship and still nothing. I share my picture and get ghosted. Its quite the hit to ones psyche. And I have been putting myself out there for over a year at this point. I have definitely had thoughts of just giving up and resigning myself to being alone for the rest of my life but that has cascaded into some fairly dark what is the point of it all notions in my head that id rather not contemplate again. So i get myself up and try again each day knowing its probably going to go on like the last I am sure this is fairly common to some extent but I have been getting reallg low more frequently because i think I am goibg to die alone with no kids,Depression

47464,Depressive Slump How can I get out of this hole? Ive always struggled with depression and recently anxiety so this year I decided to get medicated. As I did that things felt like they were looking up like I finally took a chance on me and I was working out every day and trying to be productive. But then I start to think and I get more and more hopeless as I realize all my peers at 2425 have degrees and careers and families and significant others and even goals but I have none of those. Im 23 and depressed. I feel so rushed to start my life but I dont know how or where to start Im trapped in this loop everyday but Im just never getting better. I know I shouldnt compare myself and we all go at the same pace but at this point I want to do it for me but I just have no energy. Simple tasks have become so hard and Im just so overexerted. Any advice from anyone whos been able to get out of this,Depression

11665,I am starting to feel like I am not the type of person who should be in a relationship. Romantic friendly any relationship. I am too pathetic. I always pounce at the opportunity to open up about my problems to people I think I really crave someone who will always be there for me. But it always just ends up making things awkward and burdensome for others. I have no purpose in life. Maybe I should find a hobby or something. But even then. Hobbies would just help me get by day to day. In the grand scheme of things I have no real purpose in life. I feel like I am just living waiting to die. I am not extremely passionate towards anything. Ironically the only thing I really value is maybe my relationships with people but I cannot hold even those together. So I just exist. But existing is getting tiring. I often feel like I want to ram my head into a wall harder and harder until I just pop. I am so emotionally and physically drained from staying up every night just crying. I am so so so so tired. Just an empty rant,Depression

I have had a therapist for at least 3 months and she knows of my issues. but when i told her i felt depressed all school holidays she said i would too if i was doing the same thing everyday for a long time. and basically said i need to be doing my coping strategies breathing and grounding like she says every session. when i said I am depressed to my mum all she is doing is making me go on more walks with her and do my homework which is just making it worse. my friends said they have been tested for depression and anxiety by doctors immediately and I am just so frustrated. why is it not the same for me? why does my family seem to think its no big deal? am i wrong in thinking that there should at least be a discussion of taking meds and that breathing might not be enough to deal with my symptoms? why am i not diagnosed.,Depression
47373,Im tired I hate working. I can only get jobs in the serving industry amp I hate it. I dont want to go back to fast food but a retail store would be nice. Although I always get denied.I broke last week amp quit both my jobs in the same day w no savings. I have no friends. No family. Thinking of just selling all my furniture paying my last months rent amp living in my car.Idk what to do about car payments tho. If I cant find a job I that wont make me miserable by the time its May 1st. Ill pretty much off myself. My lease ends April 31st. I am just too depressed amp Ive been feeling a little too strongly lately. I feel lost. I feel like I kinda fucked myself over for a reason. But also I couldnt stop crying during shifts or get told I look like I just woke up even though I had so much makeup to try to cover up looking so sick amp sad.,Depression

47809,Idk what to do with myself Just as the title says I really don't know what to do with myself. Both emotionally and day to day tasks. I was laid off almost 2 months ago now and I find myself struggling to be wanting to be productive I have no interest in doing anything and just feeling abandoned on an island. Yes I know I'm struggling with depression that's nothing new in my life. My partner is the sole bread winner at the moment and I'm struggling with my value as a person and as his partner. He's very much an absent partner at this point. He plays his game every day all night and the whole day on the weekends to destress. He helps by doing possibly one task a day which is usually feeding the dog as I make dinner. I do everything else. I do all cleaning shopping cooking administrative and ect. I've had talks with him asking of him to do more and his defense is that he helps and it honestly pisses me off that he refuses to understand no matter how many ways I try to express to him I am struggling. He is a part of this household and I am not is caregiver.Hes already not an affectionate kind of person. His version of cuddling is putting his arm on my lap for the maybe hour we spend together on the couch during dinner. And I except this about him. It just makes me feel even more removed from him when I'm struggling with my value.I'm out of lost as to what to do. I find myself paralyzed daily. I want to work out and lose weight but I'm too ugly to be seen in public. I want to go out and make friends but my nuero divergences tell me I'm too weird too. I want to work on a better career and can't do a thing except stare at my courses. Everything I want requires steps and I can't bring myself to take them no matter how hard I push.I just needed a space to pretend that I am heard. I would love any tips if there are any out there with finding and solidifing your self worth. Thank you.,Depression
25117,I finally decided to drop out of collegeI simply could not endure it anymore I cannot keep torturing myself with all the stress and anxiety that it gives me everydayThe whole day I have been feeling miserable about it because...I lostLike I always do You did it depression I lost,Depression
14596,I am finally doing it. I just do not want to live anymore. Death is my best and only choice. I tried to live and I failed. I plan on hanging myself. Farewell. Goodbye,Depression
14665,I do not know how to begin and where my life is just a mess everything thing is worse than the other. I have lost the hope that my next day will be better I do not even know why the fuck I am stil alive. I should kill myself because it is not worth it if it is to have that kind of life. I am 17 year old with no real friend or people I can trust never was in relationship or even close I could be in space or not even alive that it would make no fucking difference I have not talked to any friends in more than 3 weeks and I see how much people care for me no one even wrote me a message I do not really care anymore. I have so little social life that there was really no difference for me when corona arrived. Oh and everyone but like every fucking everyone I know is better than me on like every fucking thing. I went to see a psy a while ago I planned on tell her about a lot of things like my sucide thoughts and the fact that I may have attempted once or twice to do it and other things but the first words she said to me were that every thing I told her was confidential BUT if it was serious she will have to tell my parents as I am a minor so I told you nearly nothing like really nothing and it did not help me at all. Each time I came home my mother asked me if that was the last time I went there. For all those reasons and the fact that my brother would not stop insulting me on the fact that I needed a psy and just insulting me in general and on stuff that he knew would hurt me I decided to lie to my psy by faking having no problems anymore it worked. I could talk about it for a lot more but it is just boring to read or listen to so I will just stop here. Sorry for the time lost reading this do not know where to begin,Depression
19901,I want to vent properly...but i cannot get myself to...nor have anyone to vent to...I am always thinking everyone would be fed up by me by now...I cannot enjoy life...i do not want to live where everyday just feels like a duty that i have to accomplish...like i have to do it even if i do not want to...I have completely lost my appetite...i only eat one or two snacks daily...i cannot even remember when i had a full 3 coursed meal...I want to start self harming again...but I am tired of hiding my scars...and do not even want to explain my scars now....I feel like I am trapped in a never ending loop that keeps getting more and more difficult for me...I do not want to die...i just want to disappear from everyone is memory...like i never existed in the first place..I used to masturbate years back because it helped me feel happy...but i just cannot do it anymore...i tried some months back...but i..did not feel a thing...i was like..what am i even doing...All my past memories when i did bad stuff...when i used to hurt myself...and all my nightmares keep coming back to haunt me now...The only thing i do in a day is to take my classes...and i do not even know properly what i learn because i can no longer concentrate...I just want to run...run as far as possible from everything from everyone... ..,Depression
27128,I have said this to my parents who always refuse to acknowledge my coping mechanisms but I want to ask others. Do negative thoughts somehow help you cope with your depression? Because somehow it helps me. Negativity helps me.,Depression
21778,Hello I have 22F struggled with my mental health since I was very young I was bullied when I was a kid and developed social anxiety because of it. Then I became depressed in my teenage years but got better when I was 20.I have never been good at interacting with people due to my anxiety I find it really hard to talk spontaneously to people but at the same time I can get defensive over anything like I feel people are attacking me or trying to make fun of me but in reality they are just joking around. A lot of people do not like me because of that I seem really mean but I am not I wish I could be friends with people like a normal person but I just cannot. Lately I have been having good days and bad days but exaggerated. When I am having a good day I feel amazing I am productive and do a lot of things. But in my bad days I feel way too bad I was clean from self harm for 4 years and I did it again like a week ago. When I feel bad I also cannot stop thinking I want to die I feel like no one will ever like me Ill never get a job because I run away from good opportunities because of my anxiety. I just want to disappear but I do not want to kill myself because I do not want my family to suffer. TLDR I do not know if I am depressed or not I have motivation a lot of days but some days I become suicidal and I think its all because of my anxiety I can feel happy some days and other days I want to die,Depression
13918,Ok. I am not a shortwinded person so I apologize in advance for all the information I am about to dump. To make it easierTldrI need to fix my inability to be productive. A lot of it can be explained if you understand ADHD and depressioninduced executive dysfunction stuff. I have tried ADHD medication 36mg concerta 20 mg ritalin or as needed depression medication Wellbutrin 150 anxiety meds celexa 20 therapy ADHD coaching the just fucking do it mentality the ignore the emotions of not wanting to do it mentality reward systems creating daily patterns coworkingbody doubling breaking down projects into small due dates using project management programs scheduling out my whole day minute to minute who the fuck knows what elseI am really suffering from this voice that just keeps saying but what if I do not every time I try to implement each of these tactics. Its to the point that I am not earning enough money to pay 600 of rent out of income every month. Yeah. I am not earning 600 monthly. Its closer to 500 which is about 10 fucking billable hours. Not all of my working hours are billable but jesus fucking christ this has to stop. The only reason I am holding on is because of past years of diligent saving. Thank god for that and even so I just had to cash out an investment account to stay afloat. What the fuck do I do. My therapist keeps suggesting great ideas and nothing is sticking. I am truly seriously disastrously failing. Anyways full storyDiagnosed with adhd at 8 medicated at 10. Started on ritalin. Changed to concerta at some point. Switched to vyvance which made me suicidal. No one noticed and i did not realize it was medication related so i was on that for two years. Went back to concerta. Last change to medication was in about 2014. Struggled academically my whole life. Even with the diagnosis I was convinced I was just too lazy to do well. I believe I am smart but academia and I never agreed. Got a degree in web development and graphic design. I honest to god love it. I love doing what I do but even that is not enough. I do not even draw for fun anymore. All i do is listen to the same podcasts over and over again. Anways. Since then finally took ahold of my mental health got some proper diagnoses in order to start treatment. Potentially relevant diagnoses avoidant and ruminative type OCD anxiety and depression which is the newest discovery also should have been the first. It was a no shit sherlock kind of moment so treatment is just beginning through therapy and wellbutrin. The Obsessive Compulsions create a need for absolute perfection. The OCD says something bad will happen if everything is not perfect. And the anxiety says but you could never anticipate every way to make something perfect and what if its already flawed before you even start? The depression says not like you could ever achieve perfect anyways so why even bother. The ADHD says lol by the way here is a red herring to follow this will certainly make your work perfect if you spend 12 hours researching it oh and by the way here is zero serotonin for any of the work you need to do but hey you can have a days worth of serotonin if you keep scrolling on reddit. Also let us forget to do laundry for 6 weeks forget were putting food in our mouth for 45 minutes and staring blankly at the floor debating about the best way to start sorting your laundry for two hours is for sure important.So I am on Celexa. Things go well for a while. Anxiety is gone work is good I am making good money and enjoy what I do. Inevitably anywhere from 48 months after starting something new be it a job promotion moving somewhere new etc i just stop caring. Its like a fucking brick wall. And this has been true for more than a decade. New semester of school I inevitably get straight As for the first four months then its a race to see which makes it to 0 first the school year or my GPA. New job? I wow everyone for the first two quarters. I am participating in task forces developing brand new systems for everyone at work getting huge compliments from clients and coworkers alike. Then its just what if I do not? So I get fired or I am the first person laid off because of the pandemic. Now I have this amazing thing set up. I am working for myself which means I do not have to work full time. To make ends meet and save a little extra I actually only need to work 2030 hours a week. Its fantastic i love it. I get to choose my clients I get to get out of bed at 9 instead of 7 I can go on vacation whenever I want. But the last two months have been a fucking joke. I am thankful I have amazing clients who are understanding and lenient but I have some huge due dates coming up that I am on the verge of not having enough time to complete. I am losing clients. I am losing money. Last year I made 30k in 6 months. This year I have made about 6k. What is wrong. I am desperate. I am failing. I do not know what to do. I went on wellbutrin about a month ago. The first two days were magic. The most productive days I have had in 2021. But then the wellbutrin tapered off. I get it medication talks need to happen with the doc i know. Its just that I am starting to think those amazing two days will not be something I can replicate. Oh and were hoping to up the adhd meds soon but we need to wait on the wellbutrin. Concerta does jack shit anymore. Ritalin gives me about 45 minutes of good concentration. I cannot keep going like this. I really seriously cannot. Please hep me. I am failing because I cannot make myself care. Every time I need to do something for work or life its just but what if you do not do that? I desperately need help getting control of this.,Depression
38874,i m trying to figure out if this is an anxiety thing i have been thinking that i may have adhd and i know this is a symptom of it but my therapist say that she won t test me for it bc anxiety can mimick adhd i go through these period every few week or some time every few day i m either really motivated and will do a million thing in a day and clean shower hang out w friend everyday but if this go on for too long i get extremely depressed and burnt out this happened friday i wa so motivated i went to work then the gym then cleaned then saturday i wa out all day something not normal for me sunday wa the same i worked then went out w friend spent all day with friend monday and tuesday worked then went to the gym but now i m extremely depressed and my room is so messy and i don t have any energy and just want to lay in bed for day and not talk to anyone i thought this wa an anxiety v depression cycle but now i think it s sort of a manic like v depression burn out cycle i m just looking to see if anyone can relate it s so hard to keep a job bc of these period of burn out no matter what stage i am in the cycle i m still extremely anxious i just have more motivation to push through it when i m at that point in the cycle,Depression
11201,I am 19 M Its 6am and I have work soon. I cannot sleep and I have not but this is not like me. I have been up all night with the same thoughts running through my mind you should kill yourself who cares how you feel its not like you are important shut up shut the fuck up and stop being a bitch I do not know what to do anymore. Every day feels the same and nothing gets better. I have felt this way since I was in 7th grade and now its to a point where I genuinely do not think I am worth anything. I feel so broken and lost all I can do is cry and think of how terrible I am. Its every day these thoughts of hating myself run on replay in my mind. I have no emotional support from my family or friends and I cannot afford therapy. This shit hurts so bad and I cannot tell if I am actually depressed or just full of self pity. Oh my god it hurts so much and I cannot get out of this hole. I know I am better than this and can overcome it. If you met me in person you would have no idea I felt this way. This probably sounds the same as every other person who is reached out for help on Reddit but all I think about is how much better off I would be dead and its not how I want to be. Could somebody please help me see the light and how much better things could be. I feel nothing but emotional pain and always hate myself for any small thing I do. I just want to overcome this and not end up taking my own life. I really need someone right now,Depression
14034,I just got diagnosed with depression. I am on depakote risperidone and amitriptyline. I know that it sounds pathetic but I have not had friends for 3 years and I have never felt older. I am only 15 but lately everything has been making me feel so old. I just cannot talk to peoplethere are so many things wrong with me. I cannot even cut anymore I threw out my blades because I was sick of my scars but now I regret it. I cannot believe I managed to get through these 3 years while studying like crazy. My wasted energy was not worth it. I am sorry if this does not make senes I am really tired of everything. This is terrifying.,Depression
25774,I feel obsolete like I have nothing to offer this world. I am one person out of the 7.9 billion other people coexisting on this earth so the question is what makes me so important? What do I have to offer over anyone else in this world? What is my purpose and why am I here and why do I even matter? So many questions run rampant through my mind left unanswered as I go about my day not living rather solely existing. Sure I have my own passions and people and causes that are important to me. I love to workout play basketball draw surf hang out with friends and play with my dogs. My heart aches for kids in the foster care system especially teens who age out never finding a place to call home. I care about fighting to make a difference in the lives of those around me and I strive to always be kind no matter what. Nonetheless I feel as though all of this is in vain. My life has really only just begun and yet I feel as though my time has come and gone. The last grain of sand in the hourglass of my life has slipped through to the other side and my existence and importance to the world is now obsolete. I do not matter I am merely a speck on this earth that will continue to go unnoticed and unseen. At least that is what it feels like. I do not have any hope for my future because everything I do feels so unnecessary and unimportant. I feel worthless I feel obsolete,Depression
19510,I just do not feel emotions like I am supposed to do. I could play my favorite games talk to my friends and everything I feel is boredom. I cannot laught without starting to think that my life is sensless and I will never accomplish anything realy useful for this civilisation. It all startet in march 2020ofc it did with a few thoughts about where I see myself after school in 51050 years etc.. It quickly got out of hand and turned into an existential crisis with 1516 and how none of my actions could changeinfluence anything bigger than my sensless relationships with friends etc. I cannot tell myself anymore that i matter or that anyone would matter if I just was not there. I miss the old days where everything that mattered was wich friend had time to play with me or what my mom is going to make for dinner but in the last few months these things are irelevant just IRELEVANT.I cannot get the motivation for anything. My grades dropped and are influenceing my future carreerif i ever have one dramaticly. I dropped from a solid 2B to around 34between CD wich is not realy helpful if you try regaining any confidenceselfworth.Only a few know about this. I recently told my mom that i wanted to speak to a therapist but geting a therapist in Berlin is like trying to catch a fish in the deadsea. The only thing that holds me from killing myself is the fear to hurt or to disappoint my family and friends. do not get me wrong I do not want to die but I do not want to live either. Being a nihilist does not help verry much. I would rather not exist than stay alife and suffer. My death will not affect anyone eccept my family. it is getting late so I am going to close this now I might add some shit in the comments tomorrow. Thx in adwance. I do not feel happy anymore and i do not know what to do about that,Depression
18367,Hello people how are you?I am an university student and currently I am on my winter break. It lasts a month and its becoming tiring and really boring.As I said above when I am free from any compromise like studying or anything else I feel sad. I become sad out of the blue usually at night of course. I think of my life of my friends and I usually get jealous of them usually girls that i like hahah.However I do not think my life is bad it is just very plain and with no big things happening. It does not help that I live in a boring and small town in the middle of nowhere for now.My days are really boring because I do not have anything to do I feel unproductive and I cannot focus on reading what I like. Nor practicing other things I like like languages or math. I am always listening to music usually jazz Frank Sinatra or old rock.In spite of this situation I go through every summer or winter break I enjoy studying when I have to. It makes me feel I have a purpose to do what I am doing even if I fail. It does not demotivate me I kept on studying and trying. And I feel very happy and excited.Just that It is not my purpose to seek any professional help nor I am desperate. It was just to share my experience maybe as a relief for myself. I feel sad when I have nothing to do,Depression
26828,Then more lies come up and closure seems impossible. Marriage. I am trying to change,Depression
25683,I have reached a point where I know I need help. School has taken so much of a toll on my mental health that I am stressed and anxious all the time. I am crying myself to sleep many nights for no reason at all and pretend nothing happened the next morning. I do not mean to offend anyone by attempting to selfdiagnose but I am really starting to consider depression. I just wish I could stop existing for a while. I really do not want to die I have too much to live for... people who need me and I need them too. But sometimes it feels like the only escape. I want to tell them so much and ask for their help but I just do not know how. I am so tired of this... RantHow can I ask for help?,Depression
17558,I am in such a bad place right now. I cannot stand when people tell me to go for a walk or whatever to destress. I can do that. I can go on a 30 minute walk. But I will come back in the same fucking place I was. I will STILL be angrysad I will still feel alone I will still want to fucking die but Ill just be sweaty from wasting my time walking around. I cannot turn my brain off on the fucking walk. If anything Ill be stewing over whatever is making me sadangry and come back even more emotional. I cannot turn my fucking brain off. I can do all the stress relieving exercises but it does not fucking work the entire time my BRAIN IS STILL ON I STILL AM FEELING THESE EMOTIONS EXCEPT NOW I am ON A WALK OR BREATHING IN THROUGH MY NOSE AND EXHALING FROM MY MOUTH OR COUNTING TO FUCKING 10. I do not FUCKING GET IT. How does going for a walk turn off your brain?,Depression
8433,I just moved states with my partner they had a great job offer and I am still finishing my masters so we headed out with plans Id get a bartending gig. And I did for about a week before I was fired for not being a good fit. The wording definitely stung. I immediately spiraled panic attack going wide with my failures cannot keep a job cannot do anything right etc. My partner was great and supportive but its hard to crack that nagging voice of worthlessness in the back of my head. I am good at my job so being fired for what I can only assume is a dislike of me in particular feels... devastating. I want to be a writer. I am working on my thesis for my masters. Yet losing a job I have had for less than two weeks has leveled me and its hard to see any value I bring to my relationship society etc if I cannot keep a fucking bartending gig. Fired while Depressed,Depression
9436,I have tried to tell my friends about my depression. They either think I am joking around or just do not say anything. It hurts. What hurts more is that I tell them I want to hang out so I can distract myself for a little while and they either completely forget or they all hang out and do not invite me. I do not know what to do anymore. I have such a hard time making friends and an even harder time keeping them. I cannot take being alone anymore because all I can think about is death but no one wants me around. I hate being alive. My friends do not even care,Depression
41362,didnt know having too much anxiety and the overwhelming depression is gon na make sleep at am sleep all day i misssed a lot,Depression
17265,Friends are few family would never miss me literally. My husband and I have grown apart. I am bored lonely and hate my life. I am 53 and completely disappointed. I want to know if I can literally escape and start a new life. Can I run away and start over?,Depression
38586,i feel very apathetic towards everything in my life i just have no drive or ambition towards anything like i m just living just because people tell me to live i don t want to be here in life or anywhere really i just want to not exist a good portion of what i ve done in life is only for the approval of others now that i m older the more i just stop caring about others i know you all will probably suggest to maybe try other thing now that you don t care about other people s opinion find thing that actually enjoy i did i took a break from uni and decided to dive into art and a bunch of hobby i found them to very meaningless i don t know how to explain it but i felt like i wa faking enjoying the thing i did just to prove to myself that i am getting better and that i am like other people i did them just to do them i m just depressed that my family had to be stuck with a daughter like me because i m nothing but lazy and careless i don t want to burden it d be so much easier for me if i could just die in my sleep so i can save myself from hurting my family by committing suicide not existing is the only choice i want,Depression

8218,Skin veiled tightly an accoutrement for ones bones Decay shelled with living InsentientAutolyticAntlers protrude timorously only to fold piercing within Poem,Depression
38864,since i can remember a a kid i had problem with anxiety it is not that i can not hide it except tremor but sometimes it is too tough and overwhelming whole my life i used to be compared to others and rejected at first instance of any kind of trouble it troubled me a lot because of bullying body shaming physical abuse even i developt chronic disease and had suicidal thought because of it the worst one wa rejection by the close one who said nice thing about me and thought otherwise my spirit in a way kept me feeling better because i made myself go against anything even if it is that stressful and i am hyperactive i know i am strong willed on one side but there is huge unsettlment on other side which is very hard sometimes to control i can have 0 bpm doing just nothing the worst thing actually are my thought and overthinking every single decision that i ever made i am thinking about going this time to have a talk because i do not know how much i can take more and when will my will break at some point even tho i make myself do thing to feel better,Depression
11402,I have severe social anxiety that I deal with daily. I am a very intense people pleaser I always say its my greatest and worst trait. I am a walking doormat. I put everyone before me but its gotten to the point where it is literally crippling. I am constantly wondering after a social event if I should not have said certain things I said or wish I could go back and time and just stay at home so I do not have to replay every conversation I had in my head over again. I literally feel like no one understands me not my friends family or even husband. Because I feel like they all take advantage of my giving trait and they all play the part of the taker. I am constantly told I am too sensitive and I should not be that way. I always put other peoples feelings and emotions before my own and I literally cannot do it anymore because its going to kill me. If anyone can relate with me please give me any advice you have to offer because I cannot live like this anymore. ,Depression
40395,i don t know i don t know i don t know i really really don t know what is going on and i am very confused and afraid for the last year and some change i have not been able to avoid the constant intense desire to violently commit suicide i fight it by trying to think hard about my family and friend and dog and all the good thing in life i have to life for but i am tired of fighting my own brain this hard every single moment of the day there are many many day where it feel like i reach my absolute breaking point and i think i m going to do it but then if i let a couple of hour go by or smoke some weed i feel fine great even but thats the thing i never really know when that s going to end i don t know the next time i ll feel better or the next time i ll feel this low it just kind of hit me and catch me off guard every single time i have always had intense emotional problem even since early childhood and i recall having suicidal ideation at even like or year old i have been diagnosed a bipolar a year ago but i absolutely believe i have a wild case of bpd i have thought that since high school but only in these recent sophomore and junior year of college have the suicidal ideation have become intense urge it feel like i have tried every other option to try to feel happy better but they all either don t work to work for a short time and eventually fail i ve tried therapy last year for the first time thru my school it wa okay they put me on mg abilify and that helped a bit seemed when i wa on the med i would often joke to myself i m glad im on these med because if i wasn t i wa definitely going to kill myself but i dont take them anymore my mother wa very concerned about all the side effect i wa having random spell of fainting or vomiting and heavily encouraged me to get off it and she also mentioned that maybe my emotional problem were intensified by the sudden condition from covid on a teenager well i wa back then and that everyone wa going through a hard time and that made sense to me so i decided to get off it i dont think i ll be able to afford it anyway after college but thats just some side background info there are time i have blanked and scared myself and that s what make me feel like my life is in danger sometimes there wa a time last year during an episode i just started stabbing my arm repeatedly with my cuticle nipper manicure tool thing it broke the skin but they were all obviously very tiny it always scared me looking back because i think if it wa a razor blade or a knife or something it would have killed me i didn t even know what i wa doing my emotion were so strong and i just started doing it there wa another time this year where during another episode i mindlessly drove to target early in the morning to get a fresh pack of razor blade to cut myself with i did not realize what i wa doing until i got all the way back home and wa trying to figure out how to work the razor blade dispenser it just hit me wow did i really just get in my car drive 0 min to target and buy nothing but razor blade to cut myself and maybe kill myself with this is where i worried i wa getting out of control and might actually do it one day i am scared it is soon i don t want it to be but i am scared it might be the urge is so strong there are time i feel no longer in complete control of my action i am scared i am checking the box for someone who is experiencing a mental health emergency but i don t know if i really am or if im just someone who is overdramatic sensitive life inexperienced privileged and attention seeking there are time i fear that i am being attention seeking and being manipulative with my emotion even when i am alone and express them and don t talk to anyone irl about it that confuses me the most but i can never really be sure which lead me to reddit sometimes i think back on my thought if that make sense and look back at previous question i ve asked and don t know if they

who might need immediate help am i really one of those people am i experiencing a mental health emergency do i need to be monitored in a hospital there are time i do feel like i am a potential danger

around me seems to use they mention their trauma and abuse and i didn t really have it a bad a them i am just sensitive i come to reddit in desperation i have never known how to express my feeling on

19195,I keep seeing these posts talking about how you go all crazy and cannot think if you get sleep deprived honestly that sounds amazing. Being so delirious that I am not depressed anymore I am thinking about trying it. Has anyone tried staying awake for a long time to ease their depression?,Depression
47236,How do I stop this feeling to give up on life and how it's not worth it? I'm feeling very demotivated depressed hopeless sad and not having the will to live anymore I just can't get this feeling out of my head no matter how hard I try from a couple of months ago This feeling has been growing much stronger since a last week.I am not exaggerating but nothing feels real anymore I am just doing things to cope with this but that is not even working.I don't feel like doing anything.Can't even focus on studies or anything.I have my personal problems which are ruining my health stress has probably become an underlying health condition in my body which I don't know because I stress a lot.,Depression
12021,I have been depressed for the majority of my life. So much of my life was was either an uneventful blur or I was depressed or extremely depressed. I did however go through a stage in my life where I would say I experienced genuine happiness. I think about this time all of the time and have realized it only amounts to a few memories. I cherish these memories more than any other ones but it does make me sad that there is such a limited amount of them. It feels as though happy people create good memories all of the time they seem to have so many that they forget a lot of them. It also makes me wonder if the total quantity of happiness really is important I am just grateful to have experienced any at all. An analogy would be does it feel better to have won 10 championships or 3 in your life time? Probably the more the better. I am still grateful that I have been able to experience happiness at all in my life even if short lived. Now I am just depressed like I normally am. I only have a few memories in my life of being truly happy,Depression
12535,I felt nothing but I read it will take about 2 weeks before I might feel something. I hope I will feel happiness and I hope it will free me from this fucking brain fog that stuns me from doing almost anything productive.I also hope the medication will work for a long time and not stop working after a few weeks or so. Took my first antidepressant today,Depression

22075,Yesterday I decided to go finish my degree after COVID forced me to withdraw. This year has been the hardest year as previous posts will highlight with depressive and suicidal thoughts the highest I have had in my life. For the first time I feel like I am looking up to see a future just a few weeks ago I did not think I had. One step at a time. But I think I saw a smile on my face today. I decided to go back and finish my degree and its the first time I have seen the light in a while,Depression
21255,I am in a really bad depressive slump and i cannot communicate what is actually wrong. I am so sensitive and disconnected and i just feel like my partner is going to get tired of trying to help me and just leave me. i would not blame him either My mental health is going to end my relationship,Depression
22126,I am 22 in the UK and my depression just keeps getting harder to deal with. I work in a supermarket where I feel overworked and underpaid and that no one cares. I used to earn more before they removed my role. what is the point in life when you cannot afford anything that helps me feel less depressed.I look at new jobs a lot but I cannot actually see myself doing any of them. It makes me feel stupid. I did 1.5 years at uni but I dropped out because of my depression and the pressure I got to a point I coulmdn't even read my work assignments let alone study or write. I started anti depressants over 2 years ago. I do not think they help anymore or never did. I also have anxiety especially with talking to doctors.I smoke weed daily because it helps numb it all. When I do not have any my depression gets worse like right now.I am currently at work and I finish at midnight but all I can think of is being back at home on the sofa with vaguely interesting content on the TV. it is about the only thing I actually want to do. Everything else I do I do because I do not have a choice I have to earn money to be able to have a sofa TV computer and the flat.I think I have had depression a lot longer than I initially realised.I do not know what I am doing or where I am going I am just doing the same thing every day.This just scratches the surface of how I feel. How do I get my motivation back How I feel,Depression
48068,Should I tell my therapist about this? I 20M have for the past 2 months been seeing a CBT therapists after struggling with mental health and depression for the last 3 years. A point that irked me was that I never could pinpoint the cause of my mental deterioration so I assumed that my condition was just a result of an accumalation of bad experiences and circumstances in my later life. I have one week of therapy left until i am given the choice to endcontineintensify therapy and Ive lately been disheartened by how little they have helped. Something I never discussed with my therapist was that I believe I was sexually assaulted at age 6 by my cousin 11F back in my home country. As far as I know no one knows beside me and her and she seperated from the family a while back as her mother divorced. If they did know they may have chosen to never tell me in the hope I was too young to remember the event. The memory is so hazy that at times I question if it ever occured. Even then I like to think of it of had having no effect on my life but recently the memory has been surfacing more. Ive never looked back on this memory and thought of it as trauma I have no feelings for the memory at all. But can something that I regarded as so insignificant result in symptoms many years later or am I merely grasping at any clue to the cause for my depression. I feel sick when thinking of bringing it up to my therapist Ive never told anyone but a very close friend of it. How vital would this piece of info be to my therapist?,Depression

39082,i finally started therapy last november because my social anxiety ha gotten too big to deal with and i feel stuck i thought it wa going well therapist understood my problem anxiety ha been my reality for year so i guess changing my mindset is a slow process and all that but a few week ago my mom told me i should try to talk with a few other therapist because she doesn t think i m not really making progress and she also doesn t like that my therapist ha suggested anxiety med and antidepressant which i m not on right now because it s like she s dismissing me she said this got me thinking that i truly don t know what the best path is because you trust your therapist you aren t the one who studied psychology so you assume she obviously know better so i thought i d try to ask people here who went to therapy and got rid of anxiety what should i expect i didn t expect my therapist to say a bunch of magic word and cure me but is it really anxiety is never going to go away you can just learn to handle it better just make yourself suffer by putting yourself in situation that cause you anxiety until you get used to it and take med to help if you want to because that s depressing i know i might sound whiny but having to make all the work myself make me lose all motivation and i just wan na off myself because i don t actually get used to stuff i ve taken the bus a million time in my life and yet i m still anxious every time i have to take it i feel like i can t win i thought that therapist would at least help a little bit because what am i paying her for telling me to accept that i can t control everything because risk is a part of life and to take a walk everyday because i could ve realized that by myself,Depression
23070,I was thinking about some stuff and I realized that a lot of times when something gives me even more anxiety and stress than I already have and makes me sadder i just lay on the floor not the bad or a couch and think about stuff.

47631,I was fired by my therapist. Does therapy actually work for you? I ask because I've been in therapy for depression anxiety secondary to Asperger's for over 20 years.This shit don't work. CBT schema therapy etc etc. Well it works for a very short time and then it's back to square one with another depressive episode. The last therapist even fired me as a client. Why? Because I didn't do my homework. Hilarious considering I'm a medical specialist and I've been doing the extra homework since I was in preschool. Whatever. ,Depression

12715,I am a 21yo male. All my life I have been your typical shy guy do not go out that much stays at home playing games do not have many friends kind of weird when it comes to social stuff etc.This year somehow I met a girl and we have been dating for almost half a year. I am so happy and our relationship is pretty solid but I have discovered that I have a lot more stuff to work on than I thought.What I notice lately is that I am always thinking about her or the fact that I want to spend time with here but I am very harsh on myself about that I say to myself that I should not be so mellow. Because of this sometimes I get really sad and mad at myself and I feel like I have 0 energy.I know myself pretty good and try to always distract myself doing any of my hobbies but sometimes I just have literally 0 willpower. I find myself laying in bed and I just cannot get myself up.I have been in therapy for the past few months not just for this but sometimes I feel like I just can'tIt's pretty frustrating How to keep functioning even when you have 0 motivation?,Depression
7515,I have been depressed for as long as i can remember. since i was really young i have run away into fantasy worlds to escape my current reality. 99 of my problems stem from my family and how little my parents care about my mental well being. they do not even think the concept of mental health exists. they relentlessly made fun of simone biles recently for dropping out of the olympic competition due to stress. i cannot tell my parents about anything I am going through and even when i do they dismiss it. i do not feel like trauma dumping on a friend i love and trust. recently things have gotten bad again and i just cannot look forward to anything. i have started to hate the sport i loved for the majority of my life i have become withdrawn from my friends i do not have any expectations for the future. the only thing that anyone sees is a high achieving girl that seems to do it all. I am not smart. the only thing I am good at is disappointing my parents. the only thing I have ever wanted is to make them proud but i will never do that. what is even the point of being alive if i cannot make my own family proud of me? i wish i had never been born and i could have saved my parents from all that they have to do for me. i will never give them anything but sorrow and disappointment and resentment. i should just go drown myself like my dad says when you do not look forward to most things,Depression

12106,I often keep thinking of what would go on during my funeral when I get in my depressive mood. It really does replay over and over again everyother day. It raises multiple questions revolving this piqued but morbid interest. Questions such as who would come to it? How many are friends? Who does not show up? How many become emotional? Am I worthy of such a grave or ceremony? Just being depressingly curious. Really cannot stop thinking about stuff like this instead of focusing on more important things going on. Really does take a toll and it sucks to deal with. Daydreaming my funeral,Depression

But I can't stop being a dick and messing up it's something I have no control over I'm drowning into these voices and things people tell me I am or I'm not. I'm not a good person but I'm also not bad but I need somebody to save me. Therapy won't save me my non existent friends won't save me so now what? I can't stop caring. Whether it is what you say or other people say. I just can't stop caring taking other people's shit with me like it's my personal baggage I just can't stop caring. For or about others.,Depression
23704,We are not looking for your daily quotes and inspirations no offense but most of us do not even have the energy to be happy. It sounds happy on the surface but it is not going to fix what the depressed person is going through. Instead actively listen to what they are trying to say most of them do not want just anybody to fix their problems they just need somebody to listen and to understand. Things are not just going to magically disappear the next day. People who have never been depressed before do not really understand how tiring it is just to get out of bed and even remotely try to enjoy life. I feel these responses are lazy and do not give enough attention to the actual person but sweeping them under the rug. Go for a walk enjoy life be happy are all the wrong things to say to a depressed person,Depression
16641,So first i have to give some info about me. I am 19 yrs weed addict since I am 14 and tried almost any drug got hooked to opioids for 3 years now and since march I am in methadone treatment so i could graduate at school which worked perfectly i gratuated last week. i also have a psychotherapist and here comes the problem. there were some bad things happening when i was pretty young one thing was troughout my whole kindergarten and elementary time the other 2 things happend when i was 12. it really fucked my brain back then and i think it was also a reason why i started taking drugs.it got a little better in the years but since I am 17 i have no motivation for nothing regret everything i did my selfconfidence does not really exist I am fucking scared of the future and always feel like my chest is out of stone which makes me feel like my emotions are not really there nothing makes me happy. i always tell it to my psychotherapist but the therapy does not help at all. i got worse and worse and since a few months i cry in my sleep like every 46 days everytime the dream i fucked everything up and my life has no worth or meaning and then i wake up with my face and bed full of tears. also my body feels a little bit numb. i just feel like i cannot have especially positive emotions. everytime when i tell it to my therapist she tells me that i do not have anything and its just the stressed months I have been trough with methadone treatment and everything. but it makes me feel so fucked up because i feel like I am crying over nothing and other people are way more fucked up in the brain so that i do not have the right to say that i feel bad.i thought maybe i have a little depression but self diagnosis never helped anyone and I am not a expert so i can only believe her.also i do not want to play down depression because people can really suffer extremly bad from depression and it feels like if i would say i have some kind of disease it would be disrespectful to the people who really suffer from mental illness.i really do not know how this will develope I am just so scared it gets worse and i just cry about nothing because yeah my therapist says I am only a little bit stressed not ill. its just that its such a long time now and i want to get better. so here is a short explanation if you did not understood what i meant my therapist says that I am healthy and have no mental disorder and yeah because of that my symptoms i described are not treated and it just gets worse and i feel like I am a hopeless case because I am just like a weak person who crys because of so small things others would laugh about it. i really hope i could point out what i wanted to say I am not a native speaker so just ask if you do not understand something or what my problem is. its just that i cannot really describe it how i feel.stay safe and if you read till here this really means much to me. I do not know what is wrong with me,Depression
20124,I do not know what is wrong with me anymore. I do not have the emotional capacity for most things and some days I really do not want to be here. Sometimes it feels like nobody really cares. I feel like I have been looking the wrong places for validation or acceptance and its so difficult for me to continue on. I ruin almost every relationship I get in when I drop the facade of being fun free and nonchalant. I really wish I were in therapy. You know what hurts the most? It feels like everyone is gone. Friends the one person I started to like..life feels very weird right now. I am so confused and I just want things to feel okay again. I want to feel okay again. I have lost myself,Depression
40140,i ve been keeping myself from here yet at the same time i keep coming back to read about other s experience maybe a a way to prove to myself that i don t have it a bad still though i feel so depressed and withdrawn from everything this suck everything suck i wish it wasn t like this plus i still can t put my finger on what exactly made me start thinking in such a nihilistic way i m constantly thinking if i went back in time or maybe if i did this just thinking of what could ve been knowing it s just going to drown me in hole of self absorbence i don t know if this ha bad grammar so if it doe then sorry,Depression

18710,Hi everyone and thank you for taking the time to read my post.As english is not my native tongue I will do my best to be as clear and concise as possible.About three months ago I celebrated my 31st birthday. The day after when I woke up I felt some sort of fatigue. I thought it was nothing to worry about and I decided to sleep it off. The next day I felt the same but I began to be very anxious about what was going on in my system. I though I had all the diseases in the world and that I was on the verge of dying. Then as I was trying to fix something on a relative's computer I could not use the trackpad and I thought that I was going crazy. I then had this very hard to describe panic attack where my heart raced and I began to see weirdly. I felt so disconnected and I my mind was everywhere at once. It took about 30 min to finally calm down. I explained what was going to my relatives and they suggested I see a healthcare professional.I was prescribed a series of blood tests. Everything came back fine but my bad cholesterol was just a smidge high. I was then put on Seroquel that was the worst thing I have ever done to myself. Every morning I would wake up feeling like a Zombie and I had this constant vertigo and fatigue. It was horrible. Then I switched to Zoloft which is what I am taking at 50mg and all the fatigue vertigo headaches and muscle pain went away. I am still feeling anxious to this day but it has been manageable so far.Now I am dealing with a very hard to describe problem. I feel like since this event I am not back to my normal and I am afraid I do not even remember what was normal like for me. I feel like I am about to lose control and just go crazy. Like I am controlling it but I always feel on the edge of being able to not continue to control it. it is very hard to describe I am sorry. Also I feel like I am not myself like if I am not connected to this world and that even though I know I can see with my eyes I feel like I am somewhere else and like if being in my body is a lie.I have done some reasearch on this at it looks to be called depersonalisationderealisation. This reddit post explains quite well how I am feeling keep on having these existential questions. Like what happens after death? Why me In my body why born in 1990 why in America why in this universe? What was before this universe? Why living if dying is only option? Are we living a universe with multiverses and with higher dimensions? Are we just a few milimeters big and there is something out there so much bigger than the universe and we are just like an ant on a log? What if tomorrow there is this big black hole somewhere in a distant galaxy that swallows everything and that disturbs our galaxy in a way that our existence is in jeopardy. Why am I having these deep thought provoking philosophical questions?I feel like I am living on borrowed time. In a way we are all but it feels like there will be this day when I learn I will be dying soon and that I am not eager to be there in that time period. I also feel like time flies and that everyday is a step closer to death no matter how far away it is.Am I the only one feeling like this ? Is there a condition for what I am feeling ? My doctor will not get me evaluated by an external psychiatrist since he thinks he is able to diagnose me with his knowledge.Daily living is a challenge. Need help !Thank you I feel like I am disconnected from reality or my body. Like if I live life in 3rd person.,Depression

25364,I have been trying to get a therapist but my insurance is bad and the one place I could find was South Jersey Behavioral Health. do not go here. It has taken them a total of four months to get an appointment. They do not pick up the phone and the message box is full. I had to go there in person in May to fill out papers since they do not pick up wait a month for an intake call wait a week for a call to set up a real appointment and when they did not call I go back there in person again no picking up phone. Secretaries are just shooting shit with each other and not busy. I ask her to make me an appointment and she says the next appointment is mid August. I asked why it takes so long to get an appointment she says they are booked. Really bitch? You guys do not look busy here at all. I just told them I will be taking my business elsewhere like there is anywhere else and to go fuck themselves. I came home and filed a complaint to the Better Business Bureau. it is just to give them info I am not taking legal action.TLDR Doctors hate me for no reason and no one cares about my mental health. I reported behavioral health place to BBB,Depression

37691,i have been suffering from what i can only imagine is some kind of fairly severe depression for almost year now i m sorry if this post is hard to read i m new to redit and have been reading post in this sub and it just made me feel moved to share my story to start off my depression started almost year ago i wa in a wonderful relationship with this beautiful girl i had met in highschool and i had moved away to college but i still came home every weekend to see her everything wa going great and then over the course of a few week or month i don t even remember how it really started i just began to get more and more depressed at first i didn t think anything of it i m the middle child of other boy we grew up with a very abusive father until i wa when my mom took u and left and i just always through depression wa something only weak people got and i never fully understood it although now i know that my real father struggled while mental illness and sever depression anyway back to my story every in my life wa going great i had made new friend in college and my relationship wa going great i just could feel myself becoming more and more closed off and lonely even though i wa surrounded by amazing friend and family i began to fight with my girlfriend because she could tell i wa being distant we started to fight more and more the the distance only made it worse when i finally did open up to her all she knew to do wa tell her mother with made me miserable i hated that fact that i thought someone saw me a weak and i started to dread seeing her and her family a couple month into my depression and my girlfriend ha become the only person who truly know how i feel and is the only person i ever confide in then one day a close friend of my girlfriend commented suicide this absolutely destroyed her she became extremely depressed and started to have suicidal thought i then pushed all my problem aside and did my best to help her through her issue i took her to counseling and did everything i could to help her but she slowly got better and wa never the same and now with u both being depressed our relationship became miserable neither one of u were happy and we thought that if we split up maybe we would be able to find some joy in our life again so we broke up in made and these last 0 month have been the worst of my life she wa my best friend and the only person in the world i have ever loved it s gotten easier these past few month but i have lost all joy in my life everything i used to love i have no passion for anymore i m still in college but i don t every compete any off my work i never go to class i hardly ever sleep ill go or night sleeping maybe hour a night then ill just sleep hour straight i find no meaning in life anymore i just feel this giant empty hole in my chest that i can t feel my grandmother died last month we were extremely close and i never even shed a tear the rest of my family wa balling and i wa just sitting there with no emotion i m never happy i m not even sad i just feel absolutely nothing almost every other night i put my pistol to my head just hoping it ll go off because i m not man enough to actually pull the trigger i ve tried to move on and tried to get better i just don t know what to do and i have no one to tell i transferred college so i lost all the friend i had and i m too embarrassed to tell me family i ve read every self help book i can find and nothing doe it for me i just keep praying that one day soon god will take me off this earth because i don t know how to keep living like this i m sorry if this is too long and i know i jump around a lot and everything may not make sense i just wanted to get this off my chest and i m thankful there is a place for me to,Depression

25292,How will therapy help when there is so much wrong with me? I do not see how techniques and ways to cope can simply help me overcome insecurities and anxiety being around people. Meeting new people dating all that stuff. Even medication to change chemicals and boost mood. Sure I might be happy but how is that going to change my physical appearance desire to change etc. ITS NOT. Its just putting a bandaid over a wound and not actually healing anything. This is why I am so afraid I will never change. Why I want to just give up and die. How will therapy help?,Depression
38870,i m not sure if i have anxiety or adhd or im just introverted and procrastinating lol i started biting my nail since i wa a kid i tried hard to get rid of this habit but it not something i can control i put on nail polish usually but once it fall ill start biting them or fixing them with nail clipper a little bit of unsmoothness on my nail will bother me a lot and ill just sit there and keep fixing it for hour straight instead of doing any work literally every 0 min i would find somewhere bothering me on my nail i also overthink a lot it might be influenced by my mom who kept telling me that others might think negatively about me bc of any barely noticeable detail about what i do how i look so now i will just replay some scenario in my head hundred of time feel bad about myself and had to take deep breath say to myself it ok out loud or make some sudden noise to make my mind jump out of that vicious loop recently i feel that my attention span is getting even shorter i will sit down for work and get distracted after min and start watching youtube video for hour i notice myself doing that and i would think maybe i should go back to work but the other part of my mind is like numb and fail to take any action to the point that im only able to focus for a long time under pressure like a day before meeting or exam idk if it is just bad work ethic procrastination introversion or i should get a check up for anxiety adhd like i heard other ppl relate to me on point amp so idk if it just some common problem that i can just work it out either way can anyone give me any advice on whether to get a diagnosis or smth i could do on my own to mitigate these behavior thanks,Depression

8353,Like the title implies. it is been quite a few weeks since I last selfharmed to the point where most scars have faded as my family has not said anything when I wear tank tops or dresses. That or they just do not give a shit. did not do it to 'feel something' or 'let my emotions out I am not good at reading my own emotions but I am pretty sure it was just to punisg myself when I slacked on schoolwork. Well I am out of Sixth Form now waiting to see if I have gotten into uni generally doing OK with the help of meds then suddenly one tiny bad thing and BOOM. I want to take some scissors to myself. I acted like a shitty friend said I was ill when I just was not up for voicechatting and now I just want to punish myself again. And to be honest? I do not see why I should not. I did something wrong they are too nice to call me out on it so I should carry out punishment myself. With the area I have chosen there is little to no chance of any risk and I do not really mind scars so why the hell not? I deserve it! OBV I do not CONDONE THIS FOR OTHER PEOPLE BUT FOR ME IT MAKES SENSEMainly posting here to vent partially posting to figure out if this is logical or if I have stumbled into a delusional mental break again. Why should not I tw selfharm mention,Depression
39389,sometimes when i m sitting down usually while thinking about something negative or feeling stressed anxious which mean my breathing is also a bit shallow or slow i suddenly feel a moderately painful pinch zap sensation in my chest that is also felt exactly in my wrist at the same time like the same nerve wa zapped is this something that could be due to anxiety stress i ve had an xray and echocardiogram that both came back normal do any of you also experience this,Depression

48086,Can i rant to someone?? You can rant in return!! Hi!! I want to preface by saying im sorry because i know this is completely and totally selfish of me to ask. Theres a million things i want to say or express but i feel like i can only do it with someone who understands. Or at the very least someone who isnt directly involved. Im sorry i dont want to be a burden but thats what im asking i think. If theres any chance some lovely amazing person would let me burden them just for a bit i would appreciate it with my whole heart or whatever is left of it aha,Depression
10170,Hi allRecently I have felt immense displeasure with life. At work I am the functional happyfronting energetic employee. As soon as I get home I have 0 interest in everything. I do not want to clean I do not want to cook barely want to eat do not want to connect with any friends or family. Historically I was interested in OrangeTheory and I have stopped pursuing my healthy journey. I am disgusted in the way I look but I have 0 interest in anything but going to work because I absolutely have to. Has anyone else felt this...despair? losing interest..,Depression

26883,Long story short my mom found out I cut myself and now I am going to the doctor and might get medsBut there is an issue. My mom thinks I only cut myself once. How am I going to explain that to the doctor while my mom's in the room? I cannot talk about my feelings either. I just cannot. Idk. Even going to the doctor to get help will have me lying and acting like I am good. I want to be fucking normal. I want to not have to sleep after I finish my work in class to avoid having a panic attack. I fucking hate this. it is like my emotions do not and do work at the same time. For example I feel like shit and want to cry all the time but even right now in bed at 033 in the morning I cannot cry. Nothing feels real. And all I have are 2 words for life fuck this Going to see a doctor soon,Depression
11791,I cannot take this anymore I feel fucking useless I cannot stand this I have a degree I need an income not even a fucking sub shop wants me. Unemployment fucking sucks. If someone does not fucking hire me,Depression
23962,Okay so to start off I am a pretty depressed individual. Been mildly suicidal for many years and would rather be dead than live my life. I am aware that I have made my own mistakes in life.ampx200BThe root of my depression lies in the fact that I have a terminally ill dad. I also had severe cystic acne which left a ton of scars on my face so you can guess how my social life is. Before my cystic acne I was actually an outgoing and friendly individual but then after the horrible 10 years of cystic acne and now their scars I have become an introverted jerk that does not even like people looking at him.ampx200BTo top it all off I was studying for jobs before the pandemic began and now because of that the exams have all been thrown off schedule for an entire year and my prep has gone to shit. So I am also jobless.ampx200BOh and yes the aforementioned terminal illness that my father has? I also might possibly have it in the future because I took some tests and I have the factors within me.ampx200BSo currently since my dad is also off his job because of the illness and I am jobless my mom is the sole bread winner of our family. This alone puts so much of stress on me. Most days I feel like I cannot do shit because of the depression. I feel like all my efforts are in vain.ampx200BSo you can see that I am not exactly a happy person. But all the reasons mentioned above are not why I have come to rant in here. No that reason is my grandma.ampx200BI have three grandmas. Sisters. The oldest of themthe current grandma in question is just that old. So she is kind of senile. She also cannot hear a thingwe have to literally shout in her ear to tell her something and she forgets most of everything after some time. I do not even talk with her I just nod or shake my head when she asks me something because she cannot hear a thing.ampx200BSo first off she cannot hear a thing and then when she does hear a thing she forgets it after a few minutes. So you can see how frustrating it is already right? Now she is also convinced that her own sistersthe other two are thieves so she is constantly cursing them when she is alone in her room. And since I am at home the whole day I constantly hear her cursing. This constant cursing just gives me SO much stress.ampx200BShe also has the pains that every old person gets you know in the joints etc. She has intense pain in her left eye socket for which btw we have taken her to several doctors and tho they have given us vitamins and whatnot they have said that pain is mostly psychological. Gran ofcourse does not know any of this so she constantly asks for medicine constantly complains of the pain constantly calls me again and again and again either to ask for some medicinewhich I have given her like ten minutes ago or to tell me to call a doctor or to complain how her legs or her eyes are paining.ampx200BAt first yes it is pitiful and you feel sad when an old person complains of such pain right? You do what you can to make that pain go away. But when this thing goes on for months and months and months. When you hear her constantly complaining constantly cursing constantly calling your name..... How do you think it feels?ampx200BLike absolute hell. that is what. And I love her. she is like a second mom to me she practically raised. So I am in such a dilemma. I feel guilty the whole day because she asks for medicine but when I say nobecause she is already taken them she starts cursing me too. Calling me selfish etc. it is makes my blood boilbecause I have my own depression killing me on the inside and then there is her on the outside. I sometimes feel like slapping her because her curses are so nasty. Imagine loving someone but also feeling so angry that you just want to punch them in the face. What moral dilemma that puts you into. How guilty that makes you feel. And since I cannot go out because of my social insecurity thanks to a face full of horrible acne scars I am at home all day. And she keeps calling only me. Even if my whole family is there she only calls me. Over and over and over. To repeat the same questionDid I take my medicine?. I know it is not her fault. That she cannot control it. But that even worse you know. Because you can even blame them and yet they make you want to kill yourself. So please any advice? What am I supposed to do? I feel like a jerk all day. Like I am a nasty person.....ampx200BAnd what is more because of dad's illness he is also frustrated right and so he also behaves like a jerk towards everyonealways angry short tempered thinks only he is correct etc so voila! Another person who is angry at me and insults me all the time but I cannot do anything because he is sick. I have to understand.ampx200BBut who the fuck is going to understand me? Who the fuck is going to understand that I also have depression? That I also feel angry. Whenever I show my anger the other members of my family guilt me by saying that I am supposed to understand that those others that I am angry at are sick etc. I just wish I would never been born tbh. That I never existed. Then I would not have had to face all these shitty situations. I never even asked to exist. To be born.ampx200BSo please any input is appreciated. Thank you. Some advice please. Because I am seriously losing itvhere,Depression
47653,what better can I do with my time? I am just wasting my time. I have great difficulty learning new things and remembering stuff from recent memory. There's a point in time before which i remember everything nearly 10 years ago. Now I just sot around pretending to work,Depression
12050,I have OCD and depression. Those two things combined made me cut off my online friends for six months with no explanation. I truly do not deserve them they accepted me back into the group just like that. They did not pressure me for an explanation but I felt the need to give one anyways. I feel so guilty that I missed six months with them just to wallow in my own sadness. I am not going to do that again I cannot. Thanks for reading I guess this was a bit of a emotion dump. Hey I am uh I am trying,Depression
25506,Two years ago I was really depressed and I started feeling pain in both my hip flexor muscles. I saw a lot of doctors did physical therapy did an Xray a MRI...and everything looked okay to the professionals. The last doctor I saw told me that it was mental. I stopped taking the meds I was prescribed and went on with my life and they eventually went away. Now my legs are hurting again because I am severely depressed now. Just want to know if anyone has experienced something like that. Also I never fell or hurt myself in anyway so that is why I am askin. Whenever things become really stressful and I hit rock bottom I start feeling pain in my legs. Has anyone experienced something like that?,Depression
18229,I am quitting weed cold turkey so am going through some withdrawals. I do not know if I am having a nervous breakdown. I am raging at people cannot sleep drank even tho I am an alcoholic and go blackout now my heart is in my stomach and I feel so hopeless. I have intrusive thought ocd which sometimes including thoughts like may as well kill uourself but I know that I will not. But I am so low. I know this is my own doing with the withdrawal and boozing last night but I do not know whether to ride it out or go inpatient. I am unable to work. My partner is saying he wants a break.Basically my life is falling apart what did it take for you to check uourself in? Do I have to be suicidal What was the sign you needed to go inpatient,Depression
13012,Everyday feels the same. When I was a younger child my days were always so busy.I did not realize how busy I actually was until now when my day is completely empty.there is no doubt that the past year n a half have been the worst time of my life my grades have plummeted and my mental health is horrible. I know I am just in middle school and my grades probably do not matter but my parents always stress me out about it. I am also worried Ill get used to not doing assignments and fail in highschool tooRecently I started playing Tennis again and I was relieved to have finally found a hobby but I only do it 3 times a week so I still feel insanely emptyMy day consists of waking up playing video games going on social media going to Starbucks and at sunset I cry about how I just wasted my day againI also noticed I stopped caring for my pets and not playing with them as much anymore I am 13 and I have no hobbies talent or interests,Depression
25788,I feel like more often than ever my partner has called me and I am already in bed in the dark consumed by my thoughts. They ask me how I am doing or what my thoughts are and I avoid by asking them how they are how their day was etc. I asked them point blank if it was tiring for them and they said yes I expect full honesty from them and vice versa but they still think I am amazing and kept showering me with compliments and coming up with ways to help. And I know both thoughts can exist at the same time but I still feel bad. My partner had a pretty good day today. They got to see family and friends and here I am at the end of the day we usually talk fully at 11pm with my mental soup and insecurities. I constantly feel like I am a burden to them even if they refute that. Does anyone else feel this way? I feel guilty.,Depression

14871,I just cannot live my life anymore. Every day I struggle just trying to make it through living for another day. I will addictively lose myself in fiction so that I can forget I exist in reality. I binge watch shows and play video games for 10 hours straight get little sleep and binge eat snacks. Then when I inevitably have to take a break I feel an insurmountable wave of depression and misery hit me. I hate remembering I exist in reality. I hate becoming aware of my meaningless worthless disgusting ugly horrible self. Being reminded I am complete garbage and not deserving of anything I have or desire. Then it gets so bad that I feel like I need to finally do something to snap out of it. I have to take charge of my life again.So I try. I practically kill myself working incredibly hard to push through my anxiety and fear and panic trying to talk to people trying to become social trying to find new hobbies trying to go to school and trying to find jobs living healthy going to therapy... and all it does is make things worse. I do not feel any sense of relief I just find new things to stress about new things to make me feel unloved worthless and empty.So I retreat from all of them avoid them and shut them all away. And I go back to trying to numb my mind. Trying to forget I am even real. I sleep all day never getting out of bed refusing to exercise refusing to cook refusing to clean my house just wanting to forget I am even real. I do not know why I am even still around anymore to be honest.I do not even feel like I have the right to talk about depression compared to people who actually suffer through it. I am just a brat a spoiled pretentious entitled fucker. The only reason I am depressed is because I am almost 30 years old and have never been able to experience having a girlfriend. Ever since I hit puberty more than 15 years ago it is the only thing that is been on my mind. it is been my obsession yet no matter how hard I have tried I just fail.Everything else in life has been handed to me. I have a great family plenty of money I am skilled at almost anything I set my mind to I make friends easily when I want to but the one thing that always trips me up is my inability to relate to women in any kind of intimate romantic way. I always fail at that and my inability to experience the intimacy I long for and crave makes everything else in my life feel meaningless.Why should I care about being healthy having a job going to school having a family having skills and talents having hobbies having fun or doing anything if I cannot experience the one thing I want most having a lover? So I sacrifice and ignore everything else and lose myself in romantic fiction day in day out. Reading and watching it obsessively wanting to pretend the real me does not exist. I hate myself. I do not deserve to exist. I am literally the worst. I hate waking up in the morning and being alive. I cannot take this anymore,Depression

12358,Hellothis message is to everyone I am close to. I do not want to lie anymore or pretend that everything is okay with me. The truth is I am insanely depressed and suffer from anxiety disorders and panic attacks. On top of that I have paranoid thoughts as well as suicidal thoughts. I see a psychiatrist and get help and medication there.Caused by traumas I experienced because I lacked a solid contact person in my childhood who made me feel that I am okay the way I am. I have felt that way all my life. I have never really told anyone.I am embarrassed so I have never talked about it openly. But I cannot anymore. I feel an infinite depth inside me that I have never been able to fill and continue to not be able to. Something is pulling me into the dark. And at 28 I am starting to feel like I have wasted my life on my illness. I feel like I have no life. I have never built anything for myself. I am always second choice to people. Please do not ask me how I am doing when you see me. Please do not set expectations on me. That means do not ask me for a partner either. I cannot handle these questions. They create pressure and shame. I just want some people to know. that is all. Cry in the void,Depression
7351,I have been hiding my tears all day and my boss let me leave early. I thought spending close to 1k would help me cope but it did not. Now I am just home and feeling worse. I want to attempt suicide once more last time I really almost did it until my brother found me. It just brought shame and made me want to move so my family will not find my body. My only real friends are all online and I feel really lonely. At this point I am thinking of making a plan find my cat a home give away my belonging and then end it. I am done trying nothing ever works out for me. I want to be free already,Depression
18665,I am tired of being alone feeling lonely amp feeling like I owe the world an apology for no particular reason other than the fact that that I am not adding up to what anyone wants me to be. I want so bad to meet everyone is expectations but there is something inside of me that also says fuck your expectations! And I am sorry! Why cannot I just be normal? Why cannot I just be what everyone wants me to be? Why cannot I just be happy? Why cannot I just do what I am supposed to do? Why cannot I just respond to every single message from every single person all day every day? Why cannot I just take a joke? Why cannot I just stay cool and not get upset so easily? Why cannot I just go on a diet and get my body in shape? Its up to me its not hard to take control! You just have to decide to do it! Its that easy! Why cannot it just be that easy? Why cannot you just do it? Why are you always so sad?Why cannot you suck it up and move on? Why do you drink like that? Why do you feel like that? You should not be like that! Why cannot you just be normal?Why cannot you just be ok? Why?,Depression

7759,I want to make some things clear first. English is not my native language I am not from Englishspeaking country so I apologise if you find harsh mistakes in my post or if I mention something inappropriate for this particular community or in general if it is something really important please let me know and I will fix it. Also my username was suggested by Reddit.As it says in the title I am a 21 years old male. I have been living with my grandparents basically since I was born. The desicion that I would live with them instead of my mother was obviously made when I was not really conscious about it. I still have my mother but I do not want to live with her and she does not express a will for that either not that I would take this offer. I do not even want to talk with this person.With these things said I am moving to the problems I have. Now I will mention the ones that while still affecting me in a negative matter I do not see as primary but rather as secondary. Saying that I mean that I can live with them or even try to deal with them in my future by myself. They are here just for a bigger picture not much else.1. I 100 have extreme social anxiety. This is why I was not able to continue my study in university. Well not only this actually but also because it was not free and also I did not see any perspectives with my anxiety working a job that would require any social interaction which means any job outside of the Internet. I found a way around it so this is dealt with. I just have to study for it and I should have some possible income in future working online.2. I have zero friends. Like absolutely no one even online. It makes things harder but I learned to accept it and now I think I do not even need them. But that is why I am writing my problems here.3. I do not think a therapist will help me. As I continue I think you will understand why I think like that.And moving on here is the primary problem I would like to receive an advice onI am afraid that I HAVE to live with my grandparents for the rest of THEIR lives. I am the only person living with them right now and all the people from my family have their own little 'families'. The reason because I think they would not be able to normally live on on their own is because of their problems. My grandfather drinks alcohol every month for 12 weeks straight and of course this causes stress for the whole family but no one is able to fix it mostly for my grandmother. She has a form of cancer having which life can be sustained mostly without the need of hospitalisation though she still needs to be in a hospital every 34 weeks for a week. You could notice the similarity between times when my grandfather drinks and my grandmother goes to hospital but I have to tell you these facts do not have much to do with each other he was drinking all the time before my grandmother was revealed to have cancer anyways. Well hearing all that I do not seem to be a good person right? Like being raised by my grandparents and not wanting to express some gratitude? Yes and I do not feel like I am a good person either. I do not want to blame everything on the others my fault is also big here.I did not have a bad childhood. Neither a good one. I do not remember much of it even being only three years out of it. But there is not a single good thing I remember from it only bad and embarassing things. My grandparents did not make a normal attempt at trying to raise me I feel like I was raised by myself. Just providing me with food and roof until I magically become an adult. And I did not ask them for anything either I did not even have a smartphone before I entered university when it became a nessecity. Graduating from school I thought I would kill myself but I did not. It was more than a thought and a little less than an attempt. did not have the bravery. Thinking back on that it was pretty comforting not trying to improve anything in your life thinking you would be dead anyways when life strikes you with the need to become a socially acceptable person.Yes I am an egoist. I want to live by myself for myself alone. In a crappy apartment with no real life contacts working online and only going outside to buy food. I would even be fine if I had to give 50 of my income to my family if the other 50 can pay me for rent and food. I am sure I would be happy this way. What is there no place for egoists in our society? Do I have to live the same crappy life all my damn family is living? Or is this just me being depressed about my life who does not understand other people who are not depressed. Like what THESE people are living for?The moment that made me write this post happened a couple of days ago. My grandmother knocked on my door and said that she was screaming my name several times and that she did not feel well and needed me to bring her water. I think I was listeting to music that moment not really loud I can understand now why I am not listeting to music at higher volume it is the moments like this. And my grandfather was unconsious from all the fucking alcohol at the time. The only thing I said to her was that I would hear her if she was screaming. This was literally the first time she was feeling like that in several MONTHS. I feel like I do not have a single minute to relax I am always stressed because something like this can happen and I always can be interrupted even if it is not shit like that. Like I feel that if I just tell everyone to fuck off and let me study in peace I would have much more motivation to actually study and not stare into the fucking screen waiting for something to happen. But I cannot do that. I did not make an impression of being such a person. I act like I am fine and everything is fine. Not that someone actually cares if I am fine or not.You think if I am saying all that I actually did consider asking them if I can move out in future or not. I did not. I am afraid to. But I think that they will that I can. What will happen then? Currently I am the only helping my grandmother in our huge fucking garden and I did a lot of work there by myself. Her health is progressively worsening and my grandfather continues to drink alcohol. So the things are going to get even worse without me being around.I would love to be a person who would say 'fuck all of that'. Can I be that person? What should I do? I ask these questions mostly to myself but if you read that far into my post I would be happy to hear your opinion or advice on my situation. Thanks. 21M and need an advice,Depression
8313,I hate myself so much and I feel so guilty and I know I am just hurting them. I have told my gf this and idk what is happening.

So this girl texts me and originally I wanted to be friends but the last message I sent to her I asked for stuff and I felt so guilt right after that I blocked her.

I am probably the worst bf in the world,Depression

18785,I do not want to be here but I also do not want to kill myself mainly for the sake of my family. If I could die in a car crash or some natural disasters that would be nice!

8711,Is anybody else here plagued by constant stress related intrusive thoughts? They come from nowhere and always involuntarily. They seem to be related to stress since higher levels of stress make them worse for me. For me most of the times it is a fantasy i get stuck into. There are arguments with other people in my head feelings of anger and the stress that it produces. I could be going about doing my thing at home or at work and they will pop up from nowhere. The only time they seem to not be able to appear is when I am talking to someone.Does anyone else experience this? If so any tips for managing it?ampx200BFor those who do not know this is the wikiedia definition of intrusive thoughts''An intrusive thought is an unwelcome involuntary thought image or unpleasant idea that may become an obsession is upsetting or distressing and can feel difficult to manage or eliminate.''

22413,Tldr Help me support my partner as she starts treatments for severe depression and anxiety.My partner has been suffering from depression for a while and has recently been prescribed Lustral to help and given the option of signing off from work. She has also started therapy. I am really happy that she is getting help. I feel a bit blind or foolish for not understanding how bad it had become for her. I want to make sure that I am being as supportive as I can. Can anyone advise me on what I should be trying to do?Here are some ideas I have read about so far that I would appreciate feedback on positivity in negativity out do not complain to my partner about anything take that to others. take on her share the house work and cleaning. keep the house clean mess can be stressful. flowers more often. empathise do not sympathise how to do this would be good. active listening. remember it is about her not about me. do not take anything she says or does personally. read the possible side effects of lustral.Thanks in advance for any guidance. Apologies in advance if this violates rules. I checked but maybe I missed something. How can I support my partner who is suffering from depression?,Depression

11603,I have had the same thoughts of guilt anger and sadness for a week the third time. it is all I can think about is the same imagery over and over again my emotions and reaction to it. One morning when I was having breakfast with my mom as I turned 15 in May. I just cried seeing that imagery and my mom asked me what made me sad and what is upsetting me. I was scared to tell her the truth because I was scared that she would view me a different person because of my addiction to porn and would cast me out even though that night she would support me and told me to tell her anything that bothers me but I am scared to talk to her because of the subject matter. I considered doing self harm because of my depression and addiction to porn and the effects that came from it. I am getting a therapist in a couple weeks but I am scared to talk to my therapist about this sorry for rambling I am just typing this hoping it will help. I am still sad,Depression

18841,Hey reddit. I just need to vent for a minute if that is alright. To give you some background I have possible PTSD about multiple severely traumatizing incidents. I have been raped in my own bed and lost my 15 year old friend in the same year. These are not the only traumas I have but they are the worst.My mental health has been rapidly going worse and I just feel alone. I have autism and struggle with anxiety and fear that everybody hates me and is going to ditch me. I have struggles with feeling like I fit in anywhere. When I talk to my mom about it she will not hear it since my dad is extremely depressed aswell and she prioritizes him over me in this situation. I feel like giving up so bad but I cannot. I want to be done with this I have been mentally ill for the majority of my life now and I am so tired. I have insomnia terrible nightmares and panic attacks. I smoke weed to help me calm down it is legal here and I am very creative. I play guitar as of recently I make art and I sing and those things keep me distracted. I have an amazing partner and everything but I feel so so useless. I quit my studies to focus on my mental stability but all I feel right now is that I am a failure. I hate myself my body my personality my awkwardness and just me as a person. I hate myself so much.I feel alone lost and like I am about to just give up. Sorry for this post I just needed to get this off of my chest. I am alone,Depression
24844,I was really depressed before i started taking them and i felt they helped a lot. Eventually i felt I got what I needed out of them but now that I have tapered off of them i feel better than ever. Better than before i started tapering. Is this normal? Medication was mirtazapine. Feel better after tapering off of my meds is this normal?,Depression
10308,you all ever...feel the opposite of what you are actually feeling?I have always been a bit of a weirdo when it comes to expressing happy emotions. I do weird physical ticks I am no longer sure are normal. Things like squealing or flapping my hands like I am a fucking seal or something idk. Maybe that is why I was misdiagnosed with autism XD or was I? I might never know but that is besides the point.Now days whenever I get intensely excited or happy I notice it makes me want to cry. Like I get brief flashes over stupid things like the book I am reading or a game. I get happy but its like I do not know what to do with it so I have the opposite reaction instead like wanting to cry or literally forcing myself into a worse mood. Or brief flashes of excitement that set off like a bomb in my head but sputter out within seconds. I know that sounds strange. Idk if its because I just do not know how to be happy or if I am afraid of it or what. I just do not let myself be excited or happy anymore. Maybe I am afraid that I am not enjoying the things I am excited about properly so I just do not? Like that makes any fucking sense? Idk. Any of you have experiences with this? Expression?,Depression
13719,Does a guys mental health even netter?Like for a certain kind of guy who is always giving his time away and helping everyone but himself.

A guy that never rests and fucks himself over so others do not have to. Does it even matter?,Depression

15617,I do not know how people handle life. Life is unforgiving. Your choices have consequences. Not like video game consequences real consequences. When you fuck up you better be ready for the suffering that comes with it. I fucked up at school. I was smart too. My parents paid for my expenses. I did not act responsible and they do not know that I dropped out.I do not know how adults handle life. I do not understand how they can handle stress. I do not understand how they can stay responsible and not explode under pressure.Every night I see myself back in engineering school. I did not even know that was possible I thought when people say stuff like this they were just exaggerating.How can someone like me hold a job? I do not know. My stomach sometimes hurts so much I think I developed some kind of phobia. I hold my pee because just seeing the bathroom gives me shakes. I have IBS which means there is nothing wrong with my digestive system. Especially while I am pooping. How am I supposed to hold a job when I cannot even go to the bathroom because of my anxiety?I wish I was never born. I cannot see a way out. I do not know how longer I can withstand my digestive problems.Adults are doing their best. I can see that now. Back when I was young I thought I could do better. But seeing how difficult and painful life is I would say most of the people I know even the fuck ups are genuinely trying to live a better life. I am the worst fuck up that I know. And I do not know what will happen to me. Something will have to budge the pressure is becoming immense. I cannot eat I cannot even drink water. I eat so little some days my mouth smells like puke. Because if I eat then the pain comes back. What the fuck am I going to do? I am the worst fuck up I know of.,Depression

19813,I try. I fail. Its all worth nothing. There is really no point at all to trying to get out of this cycle. Only suffering and the awaiting pain of failure await. I try in vain to combat this feelings but life just keeps letting me know it is all futile. This existence is agonizing. This life is daunting. I have nothing to hope for nor nothing to keep me grounded here. it is amazing I am not suicidal yet. I have absolutely no idea why when all I get is shit. Everyone around me has a plan or some semblance of happiness. Yeah they have have their problems but they somehow go through life making it all look so easy. Meanwhile here I am this sad and pathetic sack of useless flesh. Why the fuck am I still here? I am reverting back to my old depressed self and I just do not care anymore.,Depression

7240,I got really triggered today I do not know if that is the right word I guess I just mean extremely emotionally disturbed by an article I read about how bad violence gets in prisons. How can people do such horrible things and why do none of the staff do anything to stop it? Why is prison rape so commonly joked about? it is not funny at all it is a nightmare. I have never been to prison but I just cannot stop thinking about how soulshattering that experience would be. I cannot stop thinking about how many people are going through that right now as I type this and about how they will continue to go through it for years or even decades. Endless suffering. I cannot stop imagining it over and over again.it is really hard for me to stop thinking about all of the agony that people and animals are put through and everytime I get triggered like this it is like every horrible thing I have seen comes racing back to the front of my mind. I once saw a video of someone grabbing a piglet by his hind legs and slamming his little head against a concrete floor. Another of probably hundreds of baby chicks being stuffed into a garbage bag and suffocated. How on earth could someone do that to tiny defenseless innocent babies? My brain becomes overwhelmed with the images of these scenes and imagining myself in their place and wanting to save them and wanting someone to save me. I do not know how to get it out of my head other than to off myself. There is so much unimaginable suffering TW violence sexual assault animal abuse,Depression

18960,First off I want to say that having lurked on this subreddit for a while I almost feel invalid posting here because so many people are clearly more suffering far more intensely and severely than I am. So if anyone feels that I am taking space from others who need it more I am sorry. 24M I go through cycles weeks or months at a time where I just have no motivation to do anything. I am fairly highfunctioning I have a job that I like good friendsfamily and a stable relationship. I just do not feel that happy. I feel like I am kind of just existing doing what I have to and life is just going on. I do the bare minimum at work and constantly feel guilty about it. I have found that more and more I would rather spend my free time playing video games or mindlessly watching sportsbrowsing the internet. I do not feel very interested in many things any more which is definitely a change from a few years ago and I do not feel like I can apply all that much focus to anything. I am a pretty regular cannabis user though never during work and rarely around my gf. I have wondered if that is something that I should stop too. Long story short I have been feeling lazy unmotivated and generally unhappy for a while now which I also feel guilty for because all things considered I have a very comfortable life. Should I talk to a therapist? I just need to snap out of this funk it feels suffocating. depressed.. I think? Seeking advice,Depression

21205,I feel that I am faking my depression even though I was clinically diagnosed around age 1214 by a psychiatrist. I sometimes go without showering due to lack of motivation I feel like my presence only annoys and bothers people and I have issues with being abandoned and other things I will not want to mention right now. I had a mental breakdown earlier today that did not involve any crying but me just trying to make friends with people and then having selfhatred thoughts about the way I look and the way I act. I just want help but I am also afraid to open up due to the fear of ppl finding me weird and abandoning me. I need help and people to talk to,Depression
23451,I do not really know how else to explain it. I have felt extremely off since yesterday. Nothing seems to click and I have felt empty for most of the past couple days. It came put of nowhere like my brain is just like you finally feeling a little happy? Boom now you do not. It sucks cuz I do not know why I feel like this. No drive to go out or be social. what is wrong with me? Been feeling really off,Depression
10902,it is too much effort. I never chose this life. I did not agree to be born in such a fucked up world. I hate to be so much aware of everything. I wish I could just ignore my surroundings and stay naive and unaware. I cannot think positively it is irremediable now. Sorry Sorry for not wanting to live,Depression
12762,I have found that going to McDonalds to get an iced coffee every day makes me feel so much better. Its really weird. I feel pretty terrible when I wake up in the morning but then I just go get the coffee andI feel better. I think its because its the only constant in my day and it keeps me sane. Sounds dumb but its helping me a lot. This might sound dumb but,Depression
16448,I know great title but I am serious.I had a problem with my computer and asked my dad if we had a specific cable I needed. But the way I said it was so complicated and dumb he could not understand what the fuck I was trying to say.I seriously think I hit my head a few years back and mixed with my depression that I thought I had under control but I guess the fuck not I am just a pile of mush not able to think or be creative in any way.I am afraid to talk to someone like a doctor bc I am afraid I will look like an idiot or that they do not believe me.... Anyone else has had experience with this...? Could have something caused my stupidity?,Depression
39913,everyday at some point i get this overwhelming urge to kill myself sometimes it when i wake up sometimes it when i fall asleep sometimes it in the middle of the day there is no rhyme or reason to the timing a year ago my best friend who i went to for encouragement and care killed himself and i think he killed himself because he couldnt handle my problem on top of his own i keep cutting myself and while i dont cut that deep it get deeper everytime i do it i feel like im a disappointment to my dad and grandma since i just lay around at the house instead of going to university it just so hard to convince myself to do anything a nothing is fun anymore i used to love playing game but now that is boring and lifeless my dad think i should just push through and maybe i should but it just feel so difficult i feel like im a terrible person who abuse others for emotional gain a i will often make request of others without reciprocating and will get mad and yell at others for doing thing that inconvenience me ive been trying to do better but everytime i seem to improve i come back worse than before i think the world and my family would be better of without me being a parasite i feel like killing myself will ultimately make the world a better place im sorry for the rambling text i probably sound stupid or crazy but i wanted to get my authentic thought out,Depression
20763,Am i the only one who feels like dying the more someone tells me everything will be alright because i have a beautiful heart. Urgh! Beautiful hearts,Depression
39002,i m i want to look for a job that would be good for someone with anxiety i struggle with anxiety which isn t even bad it s the symptom like blushing and sweating that i absolutely hate i feel like right now it s easy to find a job but i m just worried about it making my anxiety symptom worse and people noticing,Depression
24074,I have previously been diagnosed with ADHD and dysthymia by a psychiatrist. I was on Prozac for 2 years from 2017 to 2019 and was prescribed Concerta and Brintellix this year. I had a relapse of MDD in dec 2020 from then till now I have lost 8kg 17lb I lost all interest in my work and engaging with people. This improved for 2 weeks when I started Brintellix in June where I had a lot of energy and motivation I woke up earlier etc but now it is starting to go back to being dark and negative and just being down in general. I am also going for therapy with a psychologist. I am just wondering if I have bipolar type II or something or if this is normal? it is really affecting my work and relationships and I feel so guilty for being so negative and disengaged and hopeless yet again. Felt energetic on Britellix for awhile but depression fog has come back,Depression
10229,Monday through Friday I am fine. I have some hard days but for the most part I do ok. Then the weekend comes and it is awful. I realize how lonely I really am. I realize how I have absolutely no one. I try to stay active but I am just doing everything by myself. I try to invite people to do things but they already have plans. I have tried to go places to meet new people but I end up in places with absolutely no way to meet new people.I wanted a family I wanted the warmth that comes with it. I loved having someone to love and care for. But I think if this is my default I would rather be alone. Maybe it is greedy of me to want someone in my life because it holds off the loneliness. If I cannot be happy alone doing everything on my own then maybe I do not deserve a partner or a family. I have talked to people and have dated but even that makes me feel lonely. Its not having people I am just like this. I just do not feel like I belong in this world. I do not feel like there is a place for me here. I live in a big city and I cannot seem to find a place for me. There was one person who made me feel like I had a place in this world and I pushed them away.I am speaking to a therapist and am on medication. they are working as good as they can. I do notice a difference then before when I was not on them. At least now I just feel sad instead of suicidal. I have barely been able to go to the grocery store. I have barely been able to take care of tasks that need to be done. I just feel like I am existing. I am sure at some point this feeling will go away for a few weeks but then it will come back again. I hate being alone. I hate doing everything alone. I hate that even when I am with people doing things I still feel alone. I think I just want to be alone and not plague anyone with my burdens,Depression
37888,i feel completely exhausted my life isn t going anywhere and i ve got nobody to turn to,Depression
11829,To every single one of you all who felt the jackboot of mental illness on your throat today and still showed up... I am so goddamned proud of you.Maybe you went to work and made eye contact with other people and had lunch with a coworker and saved all of your tears for the ride home.Maybe you waited until your kids were asleep before you broke down.Maybe you cried in front of your daughter.Maybe you locked yourself in your bedroom and looked at memes.Maybe you had too much to drink and texted your ex.Maybe you listened to so many Jason Isbell songs that those ugly tears falling all over your face turned into mascara streaked catharsis.Maybe you hid under the covers and watched Netflix and did not see another soul.Maybe you hid when you heard your doorbell ring.Maybe you kissed a stranger at a bar. Maybe you went grocery shopping and wondered why everyone else looked so much happier than you.Maybe you clung to your cat.Maybe you fell in love.Maybe you moved on. Maybe you ate too much even though you feel like a worthless piece of fat shit.Maybe you did not eat at all. Maybe you got up and brushed your teeth.Maybe you did not.Maybe the only fucking thing you did today was stay alive.Every single word of what I just said means that someone showed up.You showed up and lived your fucking life in spite of the knot in your stomach. You lived. You participated in life.And where there is life there is hope.Stay cool. I see you,Depression
16942,Our company just got a new business partner who throws grown adult tantrums. Very unprofessional. And so is his assistant. I am a lot younger than them and I am a woman. Any solution I come up with he does not bother to compromise. He flat out says I do not want this! No I am not doing that. Why are you doing this? He changes the terms of the contract without notice and expects us to bow down to every request. They also ask condescending questions to me. However they are respectful to the owner. I only respond nicely with solutions and alternatives. I have never really really responded back in the same manner. I do not know what to do but every time I get an email from them it ruins my day. Yes I should have thicker skin but I feel like lines and boundaries are being crossed. How do you guys stay sane with people who are reluctant to change despite their operations is a shit show? I cannot help them anymore at this point and I may explode. dealing with unprofessional people,Depression
18193,Actually I do not know where to post. Please remove it if irrelevant. Hey guys I would like ask for yours supports How should I view myself? Currently I am panicking for ageing reaching my late 20. Society universal or just Asian? seems to be harsh on women after 20s with lots of expectations and judgements. Comparing myself to the post00 kids it seems that there is obvious difference. No offence to women out there. Anyone at any age should be valued and respected. Its just that my confidence is often attacked by these internal judgements. Besides my life have been idle for nearly two years because of depression and social anxiety. And it feels like I have not achieved anything I should. Is there no hope in life? Feels like wasting my life but scared of ageing,Depression
48142,Help with new eating pattern!!! Hello all. Thank you for taking the time to listen! I recreantly have been on a weight loss journey and have lost roughly 100 pounds in 3 months. I did this by exercising for a few hours a day and being careful of what I eat or drink. These last two weeks though I have been bingeing and eating like there is no tomorrow. An adventure that is driving me insane and honestly depressed. I still work out and such. During the daytime I am happy and on cloud9 the feeling that anything is possible and the world is my oyster. At night though I get depressed and always have these cravings for sugary food. Even though I do not want the food I end up indulging. I hate myself for doing this. I do not want to go back to being overweight moreso than I currently am. Does someone have any tips or suggestions for my conundrum?,Depression
20768,As a brief background I know I have had depression for many years I am 21 now but the last year or so has been constant. I also self hrm quite regularly not really badly tho. I know many people suffer worse than me but I feel like I have gotten to the point that I would consider doing something about it to stop it getting really bad. But that terrifies me.I have terrible social anxiety and cannot even tell my mum she is involved in stuff so it would be hard to discuss things too. But I really want to tell my best friend I have had since primary school. We do not see much of each other anymore since she went to university but she is back home for the summer and I have invited her to a concert and to sleep over at my house after. I think it will be good for me to have some company for once. I trust her 100 and know she would be sympathetic and maybe she is even had depression too. I just find it so hard to bring things up when I know it could make them feel awkward and I do not want to put a downer on the weekend. But I know if I do not say something now I will never tell anyone. I was thinking of telling her after the concert when we are chatting before going to sleep as you always do on a sleepover. I just do not know how to bring it up or what to say. I do not want it to sound attention seeking either. I am not expecting her to do anything I just want someone to know. Advice needed about opening up,Depression
39516,your brain is lying to you you matter your best is good enough even on the bad day you are amazing you have so much to offer this world,Depression
25286,I do not know how I will do tomorrow. I do not know how I did today or any other day. Seriously just fuck. My body is exhausted I am exhausted and I simply want to die. There is no other way to say it. I just want to fucking die is that too much to ask? I can barely keep moving,Depression
24530,I live with my family and I have just gone quiet. I do not talk much about anything because the thoughts on my head do not make for good conversation. I have stopped taking to a lot of people last year bc i felt they were not good friends for me and i was right i just do not have other friends to talk to. I do have one tho i game with but i have trouble talking about feelings with him too. I do not want advice when i talk to someone i guess that is why i do not. I do not want to be told to get out more and talk to strangers because i do not know how to do that. Or join clubs bc i already know that is a good way to meet people. but I am just discouraged the people i really like move away and we lose touch and i do not like that many types of people I just constantly listen to podcasts to fill the time when I am working on stuff but myself or gaming. I always feel like an outsider and i think being alone most of the time is making me worse at making friends. I do not even know what to do with friends like to hangout. Like if i want to hangout with another new guy friend my age 24 i do not really know what to plan. And i do not really want to do anything either. It feels so weird to try and make friends it feels easier to ask someone out on a date than ask them to hangout as friends. I do not talk,Depression
11330,I wish I had more positive interaction in my lifehow do I make more friends?I wish I had friends that were mental health friendly. I wish to have deep talks about depression and mental wellness. I wish I could have some compassion in my lifeThe way my life has wentsometimes I think that all I need is love. I need to be loved. I deserve it right? Id like to think that I am worthy..but at the same time I feel like I cannot socialize correctly I consider myself sort of a weird guy outside the box kind of person for sure. I think part of the reason I do not have successful or meaningful relationships is because of my weird personality. Do other people look at weird people and feel repulsed? What makes a person purely unattractive? Support Chat,Depression
9072,My body is the part that I dislike the most about myself. It weighs me down. Why do I have to take up space? Its a constant reminder of how clumsy my existance is. I do not feel comfortable in my mind either. Sometimes I feel like I cannot translate my thoughts into words all that is coming out of my mouth is an echo of my thoughts. I feel imprisoned. I want to get out. I want to disconnect. I want to be free. Feeling like your body is a prison,Depression
24183,I have just sat here at my computer turning my favorite videogame on waiting for it to load turning it off repeat for like three hours. This is so fuckign stupid why am I such a fucking dumbass just play the game why is nothing fun anymore. I guess I will just go to sleep even though I am not tired at all. Oh my god why do I not enjoy anything,Depression
19047,All I do is bitch about laughably minor things. No one wants to hear that shit. People keep leaving me because all I have to offer to every conversation is bitching about something. Even this post is just me bitching about bitching. Why am I so melodramatic all the damn time!?,Depression

19632,Instead I worked a shit minimum wage job in my early 20s while suffering from Depression. I feel like a massive loser for having worked in a minimum wage Job and the regret is still haunting me at 28. A huge source of shame for me is that I did not make it into university,Depression
47785,On and off depression? For 2 weeks Im good and feel like things are looking up and then its like a switch where everything turns to shit.In the bad weeks I cant leave the house and everyone is unbearable which really affects my life. Has anyone dealt with this and does anyone have any tips?Side note Ive been on every medication and refuse to use it anymore.,Depression
17830,What else is there to say the negative far outweighs and outpaces the positive. I am so often right about people's shitty terrible dishonest backstabbing tendencies. what is the point if I am right about those things? The More I Live The More I Want to Die,Depression
9519,Over the last 4 days I have gotten around 34 hours of sleep which is really annoying because I am tired all do so I cannot do anything but I am not tired enough to sleep How to sleep well?,Depression
14107,14 yo. i do not want to do anything anymore. my passion for everything that i once liked enjoyed or benefited me has gone out of the window. and i do not see the benefit in doing them any more. some days when i wake up from a 4 hour sleep i wish id had just never woken up at all and that i would just fall asleep forever and never wake up again. i always said that dreams were better than real life. and that has been the only statement i have ever made where i think i have been right. i hate talking to other people in fear that i will muck up. I am already quite introverted but now every time some even does something as simple as greeting me i want to get as far away from them as possible to prevent conversation where i will inevitably mess up. my daily schedule now consists of wake up do school go back upstairs and lay there until i have dinner. i have no will to get up and do something that even i know will be good for me. i want to just go away and that is the drifting thought that frequents me in my brain. i believe that everyone hates me which they probably do due to me being very unlikable and they just keep me around for their own social advantage. i frequently want to just run away from every human and cry in a corner where i can just forget i even exist. i do not want to tell anyone and i do not know if that is a good or a bad thing since i probably just burden other people with my presence and i will just annoy and make them hate me. but i want to know if its worth telling someone or if I am just being a teenage hypochondriac. what should i do? sorry for ranting i just needed to get this out of my head and online. i do not want to kill myself. i just want to disappear.,Depression
27151,I am a bubble floating through a vast empty void. I do not know what to do. I wake up every day and do the exact same thing. I feel a heavy force pulling me deeper into my home. The anxiety I feel over thoughts of leaving my fortress gives me physical pain. I have no purpose to move in any direction except back and forth. I sometimes feel that I am losing grip on reality. I feel consumed by the screens in front of me. Dependent on them for warmth. I write to myself every day just like this. Today I decided to allow the public to digest my psyche. Perhaps to give me a better understanding of myself through unbiased eyes. I am gripped with fear. There is a xenomorph hammering my inner chest plate. Please do not judge me harshly. I am always alone. I should clarify I have an elusive partner. My partner is an alcoholic drug user with a gambling addiction. They are also a hell of a go getter with a can do attitude. Observance prevents me from assimilation. Sex is a drug purchased with guilt. We have brief moments together where we exchange pleasantries before going about our days.They have a demanding job but are payed sufficiently well all things considered. I do not have a job. I have had jobs. Too many jobs. I counted once. 22 I believe. My plethora of different career paths has been both a blessing and a curse. I am well read with a variety of skills. I feel consistently overlooked. I am average height. I feel my partner has resigned themselves to the inevitable descent into drinking alone at the video poker machines. We are both 32. My partner is well liked in the community. I am a shadow. I make the rare appearance at a function or two. I typically do not eat. My choice to eat or not to eat will be my martyrdom. I have not pinpointed why my body has become the offering. Although I can provide a generous list of options. People seem to enjoy my company and compliment me on my looks and body. I am clean well dressed and have been told I have an intimidating presence. I hold a conservation well and have good comedic timing in the moment. My jokes are dry. Much to my dismay I am not a large person. I am frail. I feel myself diminishing. My soul is drifting towards the event horizon. My partner and I played jeopardy once. The fight lasted for a week. I question my memories. When I speak of fortnight's passed my words are taunted belittled questioned or worst of all... Ignored. A victim chooses to be a victim. The poor choose to be poor. The path was paved for a different vehicle yet only I am to blame if I cannot pass. The fault is mine. My mind drifts through consciousness. Nicotine and constant vigilance vibrate through my sleepless body. My fears are desperate for attention. I exist only for brief entertainment when all else fails. I am the sideshow to a sideshow at a zoo. My only solace is found by translating thoughts into little notes that I leave for myself. Even now I question the weight of my words. My screams are yawns to the deaf. Wailing is no use when I am trapped in a bubble floating through a void.Please advise. Please advise.,Depression

12235,I know this is not where I should go to be diagnosed for this but it is been so hard finding a psychologist who is not fully booked in my area lately. Every day I wake up from a usually terrible dream at 12pm and feel tired even though I have gotten 910 hours of sleep. I try everything from meditation to daily exercise to journaling but I always feel the same emptinessloneliness whenever I am alone especially at night. that is why I always end up sleeping past 3am because I cannot get myself to relax until then. I always get these intrusive thoughts of embarrassment from my past and a ton of bad flashbacks. I rarely think back to good memories. I try to push myself to be productive every day but I feel more and more lethargic and fatigued every day. I go to the gym 56x a week and eat plenty of food 2500 calories but I always end up feeling a lack of energy even with caffeine and cannot focus on my goals. I also drink plenty of water. And worst of all I feel like my memory has worsened to the point where I constantly forget the names of acquaintances misplace my belongings and my entire childhood has become a blur my mother was an abusive narc for most of my life which I believe contributed to this.Honestly it feels like I selfsabotage myself so often. I get thrown back into hours upon hours on YoutubeSocial Media to get that dopamine high that I usually never get otherwise. I try to stop but I always get sent back into a loop the next day. I just always feel sad and alone for some reason even though I have plenty of friends. My mom was diagnosed with depression before and my sister is suffering from bipolarpersonality disorder right now so I wonder if it is a genetic thing. Can any of you relate? I really do not want to take meds but I feel like this feeling is just going to get worse and it has made me isolate myself from a lot of friends. I do not know if I am depressed,Depression
40090,the suicide hotline take hour to respond i ve fucked up every relationship that i had by trying to be funny and the other person being creepy and lied to everyone i know why should i continue self harm doesn t do anything anymore nothing brings me joy i have no future because of my mental problem really why do i stay here the one reason i still live is because around new year an online friend of mine at the time attempted suicide i got so fucked up then i couldn t function properly for a week i couldn t talk to anyone the one reason i am still here is because i thought people would feel that way about me but a ive lived and breathed i have come to realise that isn t true my friend will be glad i am not around them the only disappointment they will feel is that they don t have a vulnerable little shit to kick around my family will be glad that the failure in the family is finally gone and the school will pretend to be sad for a month make it about how mental health is important tell people to be kind about one another then forget about me i won t stand out im another human being in the 00 billion that exist i don t even know if im real i don t want to be here so might a well leave,Depression

I have no motivation or drive to do anything and it feels like all I do is work and come home and I am not satisfied with anything in my life currently. I feel like the things I only want in life is to genuinely feel wanted and cared for by everyone else not just their fucking errand boy. If only I knew what being dead was like I would probably pull this trigger without a second thought. Why am I even writing this here? it is not going to make a difference. I wish I was not so selfless I am lost with only one way out and I am holding it too my temple,Depression

23412,I never wanted to have to post here again but I need to vent. I am breaking man. we have always figured my GF had mild bipolar disorder because her mom has it. But I never expected her to have a full psychosis breakdown. I do not think she physically cheated but I know she was talking to other guys. She told me she was cheating on me the whole weekend I was staying with her. I get that its mental illness.. but still. Right now I have no info on her. I do not know how she is being treated I just know from her two friends that she is still very much not there. It was a joint effort with two of her friends to get her committed. But it seems like they have got all the information and are keeping it from me. They told me I would be updated on anything that happens. But I never am. I have to ask every few hours then I finally get an update. Its like I am going through a break up while still being together with her. Its like I am in limbo do I still have a girlfriend after this? Does she still love me? Is she going to be normal again? I know with treatment bipolar people can lead Normal lives but my anxiety will not stop. I cannot stop thinking about if she is being mistreated. She is trans and were in the Deep South. My mind will not stop. I have nobody to vent to. I do not like being a burden. GF had to be hospitalized for bipolar episode. I am breaking.,Depression
48164,Hate being sober I guess Im a poly addict but rn its alcohol. I just turned 21. Im wasting my life away drinking everyday no job I have one passion and its music but I dont see it going anywhere. My gf is an alcoholic who blames me for her alcoholism. She asked if she could punch me in the face tonight. Called me a loser cuz I said she needed help. Idk I guess Im just venting but Im so lost and I feel like no one cares. My mom sends me 50 a week so I wont bother her thats how I get my alcohol. I feel like such a bum loser cant even hold down a job let alone show up to an interview. Its a cop out for sure but its because my anxiety. I get anxiety everywhere Im scared of shit like getting blown up Everytime I stop to fill up on gas. Im scared of a gas line exploding at a food service place. I cant even be outside with panic attacks that Im gonna be struck by lightning. I just need help and idk where to turn it feels like everyone hates me or is disappointed. I feel like I wont be here much longer I cant deal with the anxiety or stress or apathy or anything I cant do it anymore. I guess this is just a vent and Im sorry if it breaks any rules but damn life is just weird and sad and I dont get it. 21 btw if that makes a difference,Depression
11458,Landed myself in the hospital over the weekend. Accidently on purpose took too much Tylenol when I decided to get blackout drunk to cope with all the crap going on in my life right now. did not even get to get blackout drunk because my bf called the ems on me. Now I am battling homelessness and money problems. Just more and more crap to shovel. Depression kicking my as lately,Depression
17953,I look at other people on here and i think how lucky i must be. I look at other people in life homeless people anorexic people people that pay for their own gas people with lesser brain power and then i think about how I am not using my position in life to its fullest. This is what makes me lay down and sit there for hours. After doing this for a week i realized i have depression. Then i get down on myself for my depression and i get depressed and its a vicious cycle. Someone smack me out of this. Help me,Depression
19881,2 years I have been unemployed. Its not close to the caliber of what I am used to or what I used to do but its a god damn interview. I have an interview today,Depression
15519,I am okay. I am not a threat to myself or others. But every day just gets harder...Right now I am supporting myself and two other people one of them my wife. My job requires me to help support a further six people all cognitively delayed adults. I know that none of this matters it is just my life.I live in a state where people value independence traditional manliness guns and Donald Trump. I recognize that my experience does not fucking matter I am just another deviant leftist. I am poor. Both my parents were teachers so we did not start with much but I managed to lose everything I had and more. I have been homeless twice. Both times I clawed my way back from nothing. I recognize that I do not know shit about shit and I need to shut my fucking mouth and listen to my betters. I am so fucking tired. I know I do not matter but I keep trying anyway. I am stupid like that. Barely holding together,Depression
12970,For the first time in a few months.I just realized how little I matter to some of the most key people in my life and I spent a good while crying.I just want to be loved. To be shown some kindness and gentleness. Just some human decency.I am so exhausted. So tired.It hurts to be alive. I thought about cutting myself but then just ended up crying and writing in my journal to vent and process my emotions.It hurts when you cannot get through to the people you love. When you show them your bleeding heart and they do not care.You are shamed for having been hurt. For being in pain.I know its not their responsibility to fix that trauma. Its mine but god a simple hug and I love you would not hurt.Sometimes a hug and a little reassurance is all I need.I will not end my life because I know that is not the way.But I feel so damn alone. So unwanted. So forgotten.Its hard to carry on when my heart feels so bloody and broken. My will to live is so small right now.I am working extremely hard to love myself and fill my cup up. But it still hurts everyday.Why do the people I love most not love me back? Why do they forget I am here? Is it my own fault?I just want to be understood. Felt suicidal today,Depression
26975,I am really struggling today. I live alone I am old 37 F and have no kids no husband no family I am really close with. .. I have few friends and I feel like I have no reason to live. The place I live is a resort destination so people come here to celebrate holidays with their family. Its incredibly painful for me. It makes me feel worse than I would otherwise. The 4th of July in America is a big holiday for many. At one time it was for me too. Now I am just lonely and overweight and have no job or prospects of a relationship. I have no one to take care of me when I am old. I have no money saved. No credit. I have huge student loan debt. My life is too worthless to maintain. The bad is outweighing the good. I cannot pull myself out as easily this time it feels pointless. I suffer with PTSD and have flashbacks and nightmares. I wake up in the morning having suffered through a whole night of torture and it makes me days worse. I think back on the dreams throughout the day. I cannot work. I cannot be around people. I can barely leave my house for any reason. My dog is depressed. I feel worse because of that too. Its just piles of awful. When I was younger I was more resilient. I could see hope in my future. I could go through the bad and still have hope. I cannot do it anymore. I lost the love of my life because of the way I am in 2014 and I think about him still daily. He is married and had at least one kid. I know where they spend these holidays together with his family happy. I wish that was my life. I miss him terribly even still. I hate my life. I hate my life. I just want all this to end. I just want to feel numb or nothing . These holidays make me want to not be alive anymore.,Depression
23856,I do not understand how people do it. My current job involves pressure washing and other less pleasurable activities in the hot sun. Crawling through attics that are 110 degrees or more. Digging under houses full of rotten wood and sewage. Pulling and resetting dirty toilets. Basically if there is any miserable thankless literal shit job to be done around a property its my job to do it. It did not have to be this way. I was an all As student in high school always made the Deans list in college. I enjoy things like reading writing drawing organizing. I never wanted to be outside as a kid and resented when my father made me go work in the heat. I LOVE air conditioning. I do not understand how people survived without it not that long ago. I could have been a botanist historian lawyer archivist librarian teacher or any number of things that would not have me doing hard labor in the Mississippi sun. This is where I am though. Doing the worse jobs in the world where I am concerned with no end in sight. I wake up angry about it most days. I lash out at pretty much anybody I feel keeps me here which is everyone I should care about since the people I work most closely with is my wife and father. So I am certainly damaging my relationships as well. I hate my life. I have had one job in the past ten years I kind of liked that was basically a filling job in an office. It did not pay very well but it was climate controlled and I did not worry about ruining my clothing every day. I could look in the mirror as I walked out the door and take pride in what I saw. Now I see a disheveled defeated human being wearing little better than rags off to do another day in the salt mines.I hear people complain about their office jobs how bored they are at their desks. I envy them so much it hurts. Id give just about anything not to have to go do what I do every day. there is nothing I enjoy about it. Nothing. I do not feel like I have any other options though. If this is the rest of my life Id as soon not live it. Hard Labor,Depression
25310,Basically for a while now i have been starving myself for days at a time. Not because of anything I just want to feel like shit. I try to justify it with saying it is because i have no control or choice over the food i eat. That of course is bullshit since even though i have always hated the food i used to eat it.It is a cycle of self hate. I stop eating because i hate myself which fuels me to hate myself for creating made up problems and that leads to me starving myself and so on.It is impossible to stop and more and more things in my life are becoming this way.My family has been mad at me for ignoring them and being so shitty. And frankly i do not care.My parent is a shitty parent and I despise them. I stopped caring about what they think. Now i just ignore them and never talk to them. They act like they love me but they look down on my problems expecting me to be their therapist but not vice versa. They keep on saying they are my best friend but all they are is a middle aged child who birthed someone into a poverty ridden toxic enviroment expecting them to grow up and support them physically and mentally not expecting their own child to be in need of help. One last thing they keep on making fun of my mental problems and poking fun at them and telling me to just kill myself.Sorry for going so off topic. I was just wondering if I am the only one who hurts themselves for no reason?,Depression
21740,Sent someone a video I worked on all week. It was a video of what I have been up to lately. It took so long to finish and I was sooo excited to share and possibly have a conversation but instead I just got a 2 word response with no enthusiasm that is awesome Thank you so fucking much for pretending to even watch it. I feel so worthless. I hate when people write pity responses. I know my video sucked but thanks for pretending to care and sending me a 2 word response on something that took me over a week. I love it. This is why I shut down completely I hate everyone Rant,Depression
12568,I feel like I am screaming inside at myself to just do the damn thing but my body will not move! I know what I have to get done and I know how much better I will feel when I am done but I am stuck! I hate this shit. And my boyfriend will be so disappointed when he comes home if I have not done the damn thing. I fucking hate executive dysfunction!,Depression

25547,Yeah it is my question and I am going through it too . I do not know what one week I feel so energetic and be productive and the next week I get too negative and stop doing things .

47415,Pointless living and nothing will get better I'm 32M and have been dealing nonfixable problems for a long time. I've seen that extended family is pretty much an arseholes and there's a tipping point where my life changed because of that. At the end of Uni i realised one thing i feel like i picked a wrong subject. That's the time that i realised that working in IT back in my birth country i won't achieve anything or can afford anything by myself. At the same time i realised and considered my existence in this life. I feel nobody could hear my voice nobody cares and so on. Graduated i ended up couldn't find a job for years. Literally years. I had only two jobs one for 6 months and another for 1 month. I never and even up until today feel proud that i worked there. I feel like it's just necessity to do something for moneyliving. That's from i graduated in 20122013 to 2018. Years of sending CVs and interviews none of them stick around. During that 56 years another major event happened to me and my parents. I realised that working in family is a BIG RED WARNING because how they can treat you bad since you're Family. That's what happened to my dad. He lost his job because he and my mom tried to give a reasonable opinion towards my Uncle's son their nephew. Huge debate and my parents ended up losing the job. That moment is a tipping point for me. I had huge anxiety issue and major depression. I went deep down the rabbit hole and i have no point of living anymore Until i got an opportunity to move country by myself for study and got a job in IT industry. For a slight moment i feel better in my life but it went and still goes back to my depressionampx200BFrom here this is the present problem that i have Due to losing a job from his brother and being an older people in my country my dad doesn't have any income at all. I have to support them just for the sake being a son should help their parents' or anything about Family should support each other Due to my depression i got a suggestion from counsellor that helping people might help me slowly. Oh boy it's a very very wrong advice. I ended up losing lots and lots of money helping someone just to get on their feet and still didn't help. I can't even afford to rent place. House pricing is ridiculous that includes living cost crisis that happened anywhere around the world. Having flatmates is a nightmare. I even tried to sacrifice what i do regularly so they can have things they want like quieter place have their freedom etc.But all of them back to the reason why i created this postI'm tired living like this. This issue never ends and the only solution is pretty much having enough or lots of money. People just don't care what i've been through and nobody wants to help me as well. Family friends all of them are just arseholes.Sometimes i wish they're gone. Like literally gone or die. My parents and everybody else in this world. If it doesn't allow i just wish i'm dead. Never wake up anymore in the morning. I already wish the same thing every night. I feel done and i'm actually done both physically and mentally. Stress feeling sick all the time i sleep through the weekend and still feeling tired i have no friends and nobody Losing money means i have money problem as well and nothing's good anymore in my life.I have made peace with death. Living is a thing that scared me the most.,Depression
16877,Pretty much what the title says. I feel really positive and content with my life but there is this feeling that I cannot explain that lingers. I feel like I am just magnifying that unknown feeling because I really love and feel comfortable with where my life is going right now and out of those endless sea of positive emotions that insignificant presence somehow stood out. It feels like the tiniest spec of dirt on my otherwise clean shirt it is not really a big deal but as soon as I give it a shred of attention the more my mind focuses on it. It feels like I am heading down this really clear road in life yet wondering aimlessly. It feels like I am the host and the parasite.It really does not make sense I think I should not really be feeling this way. I love myself and anyone I surround myself with. I love my hobby ever since I was a child and not once did I ever felt bored with it. I love my life and I am living the life. But somehow somewhere this feeling just appeared out of nowhere. I not sure if I am scared of it but I sure am confused. Feeling Happy Yet Confused.,Depression

14428,My parents and family love me i have an amazing life many dogs and cats but i hate myself and my life i always think about killing myselfi hate how i look and all the pain i feel i try to act like it is not there because i do not want anyone to notice. I know my brothers are joking when i feel pain or feel bad but it still hurts me what should i do? Why am i like how i am?,Depression
18179,This is the lowest I have ever been in my life. My brother tried to commit suicide by overdoseagain. He lived. I have been struggling for two years. I got divorced after ten years and my ex got custodial parent. I was released from the military after ten years due to an accidental chemical burn injury to the entire lower part of my body. I have not been able to work in two years. I received a diagnosis of sever dysplasia precancerous cells in my overies I have three operations to remove them. My hair fell out and I struggle to keep my weight at 115. We cannot afford enough food for me and my kiddo so I skip eating. I go to school full time online. The bills alone are enough to overwhelm me but the weight of the world is sitting on my shoulders. When my brother called to tell me goodby this time he told me why he wanted to die.I told him to fight to push past the shit in his head. In honesty I felt every single reason. I understood why he wanted to die bc I been struggling with the same feelings. I cannot shake it bc nothing is getting better. I still have a year of school to push through I been applying to every online jobs I can find and continue to get scammed I cannot catch my breath. My bother almost died and for some reason all I can feel when I think about it is peace. That it would be easier to just let go. I.am.struggling. Overdose,Depression
23840,Today I lost a friend. COVID has restricted my time with him but I have been trying to help him battle with depression for about a week now and he seemed to feel a little better each time. However today he decided he had enough. After he said goodbye I kept trying to call him but he does not pick up. I fear the worst has happened what can I do? I have not even got a chance to see him one last time. Coping with Loss,Depression
20582,I have been bullied by classmates and teachers alike for about 10 years. Although I mostly remembered my classmates making fun of me insulting me pulling my hair and god knows what else with time I realised it was the teachers and my parents that had the biggest impact. I have had teachers that would often make fun of me in front of the whole class if I gave the wrong answer or did not know how to do something. Either that or just screaming at me. One of them would often tell me I am a failure and I will forever be a disappointment to my parents because I the daughter of two engineers was not great at math. My parents suggested I move schools at some point but the thought of being thrown into a new class with people who already knew each other scared me even more so...they did nothing else. Whenever my dad tried helping me out with my maths homework he would sooner or later lose his patience and scream at me as well. he would sometimes throw my notebooks in anger as well. I was so terrified I did not have the courage to say anything at all being convinced that none of the answers I could come up with was right. I thought it would be better to just not say anything but that just made him angrier. And the same happened at school. I just became too scared to say anything at all. We never really talk about this. Whenever the subject comes up they of it as if it is just another funny story from my childhood. it is very hard for me to talk about it whenever I try to explain how I felt they just brush it off and act as if it was not all that serious. they would often make jokes about me being rather introverted and quiet often in front of other people and they still do it to this day. My mum especially likes to excuse my quietness in front of other people as if it is this terrible flaw that just needs to be explained away. I have asked her not to do that explained why it upsets me and every time it seems like she gets it...until the next time when she does it again.Luckily I do not live with them anymore but whenever I do go back for more than a week something like this always happens. I wish they could just understand and accept it. My experiences and feelings are still being invalidated to this day,Depression
39578,lately i ve been having panic attack everywhere i went out to get drink with my partner and ended up cry in the bathroom yesterday we were with his friend and i had to excuse myself to sit outside and collect myself the list go on there never seems to even be anything that set me off but once it happens i can barely speak without tearing up it s so exhausting i don t want to have to hide from people place forever,Depression
37775,first off anyone looking to help can fuck off i have no interest in your pointless recycled comment they are falling upon deaf ear i am only looking for genuine advice on how to achieve a vegetative depressive state a i am unable to find a satisfactory method of suicide to people offering advice on such a thing how do you do it i suffer from ocd a well so it hard for me to have an inactive mind what i want is to become the traditional view of completely apathetic listless depression i am sick of trying to combat it and constantly failing so am now simply seeking to find a way to give up upon fighting edit to whatever arsehole reported me to the stupid resource bot i blocked it for your information,Depression
40153,i ve been having a few thought of sh si throughout yhe past week and came pretty close to actually doing it a couple day ago because my so and i got into an argument and he said some hurtful thing that other people have said to me through my life so i thought if everyone feel this way about me then why shouldn t i do it i know people will say to tell my psych but i don t think it will last that long so i don t want to waste her time and my time i also don t want her to say i should go to a hospital because i think that would be pointless too and a lot of money,Depression
47835,No seriously. WHAT am I supposed to do with my life? This is probably just a carbon copy of many posts on here but my situation is as follows khhv no friends and no good ties to my family my only interests are video games and anime the former of which isn't even fun i just rage all the time and hate myself after playing basically ANY game generally disliked by many people because of my toxic personality EOTL minimum wage retailer where i don't do a good job i'm too slow at everything i do and can't do more than half days due to being unable to be around other people too much absolutely not interested in picking up any hobbies or learning any skills there's nothing i would even keep the dedication for since i give up everything i do in life tried therapy and it did absolutely nothingI think this is what one would call being done with life.

8929,that is all I have decided that fighting day in and day out to be anything other than a total disappointment to myself is just not worth it. I am 39 years old I have a stable job a wife and a kid. It seems like I should be happy. But I am not all I have are regrets and loneliness. I had to give up everything that made meme to have this wife. And then I had to give up my chance to rediscover myself when I had a kid. I love my daughter with all my shriveled heart can. But I hate every single aspect of my life. I work too much because I have no choice. I have no time for me because my wife says I have responsibilities to always be available when she needs me. I gave up my friends my hobbies and all the things that made me smile because I did not want to loose her. Now she is all I have and i am miserable. I hate my job and spend all day every day thinking god I just want this day to end. Then when I do have a day off she finds a way to make the entire day more work. And I spend my weekends just wishing they were over too. I have only the drive to not ruin my daughters life to keep me from driving my work truck off a bridge. I hope everyday that Ill fleet into a wreck or fall off a ladder just to finally be able to rest. Every spare thought I have is about all of the missed connections I have had and the insane shit I used to do . I look forward to nothing. I cannot find a single thing about my life that I do not hate except my kid. I just decided tonight that I am going to give up on having any semblance of my self. I am pointless. I have decided to give up,Depression

26086,I have suffered with depression since my teen years and in the past have absolutely isolated and abused drugs and alcohol. I did a complete 180 and now live a pretty happy sober unmedicated healthy lifestyle. This year has had a lot going on and I recently felt myself getting very down about various things I feel super overwhelmed and cannot stop crying I found myself turning to alcohol and wanting to shut myself off so I quickly caught myself and decided to speak openly with my family about how I was feeling. My sister told me it is not a big deal my uncle told me I was being over the top and when I explained how hurtful that was to my fiance he told me they were right and it is been a week and he is frustrated and angry that I am not over it too. I feel awful that I even tried to reach out and now feel very numb and pretty resentful I also feel kind of stupid I tried to reach out to my family and was shut down wish I had not said anything,Depression

14904,Have you ever met someone and thought to yourself Hey even after all I have been through i take my chances and go for it?So i met this girl on badoo. 20 I am 23 lots of same opinions and really enjoyed time we spend together. I admit i was a bit too slow cuz hey did not want to rush things you know. But still i really felt like there was spark between us. Went on 9 dates... Well she did not run away atleast xD. I was thinking that this could be it.Sounds pretty good right?Well today i was browsing facebook with my roommate and guess what i saw? This girl is In relationship.So here i am wasting my time and kind of waiting for a next day so i can go to work and do something.I had my fair share of breakups but i really mess you up every time.I wish that one day you will find someone and have a normal relationship so that you rwach that Happy ending Rant I feel like work is more fullfilling that realationship right now.,Depression
12032,When that feelings comes to me I just want end myself and when I know I cannot i try forcing myself to go out ride scary shit go unstable online talking to strangers then at night I feel so fucking horrible. when you talk to people about it its like your problems are not even there anymore you have to absolutely force yourself to tell them what is bothering you and then when you think about what the hell is bothering me anyway? What is it that is so awful that is bothering me? there is a few but not enough. I am so discontented with life. Even when its alright its never alright. I have nothing left I have lost a few relatives and my parent is close to dying. I hate jinxing shit up. But my life was meant to be fucked anyway.I do not know what I even want I am unhappy and I have had this for years until Ill be old and regret not taking the chances of life because I know damn well I will not be able to do all the things I am doing now like sleeping or playing a few games that is not even fun that shitty dreadful feeling is just hanging behind your body and its like wanting to take a shit but you cannot. but when I think of dying fantasizing of how I die and the few days before I die it feels a bit better. I remember as a kid thinking at least before Id die Id leave a thousand dollars stacked up on the floor of my room. I still imagine that sometimes then Id run away far away to the golden gate bridge and finish this life I have Talking to people is so forced,Depression
12692,Things have changed. Even before the pandemic things were bad in terms of meeting people but now it is even worse. it is almost and probably is impossible.The city I live in is unique in terms of it as a high turnover rate therefore incidences of meeting people specifically bad people is higher than normal cities. But nevertheless the same trials and tribulations go on anywhere. But being said everything in this post is tailored to the city that I live in.But what happened? It is so difficult to meet anybody anymore. Older women like women my age they are broken bruised jaded and fed up because they are approached by pieces of garbage constantly. he is gotten to the point where I cannot even make eye contact with a woman when I am walking past her on a sidewalk. They literally look down or look away because they are tired of being approached. Also the guide to girl ratio here is out of control. there is got to be at least 10 guys for every woman that is available. Then you factor in everything from the unique primal intrigue that flows through the veins of any human being in this city and again it is impossible. Within this gigantic sea of terrible men there are few Good Men drowning not even being thrown a life preserver. it is a shame. it is a waste of time energy good souls and the possibility of memorable love. I am tired of fighting through the walls being built by women and forged by pieces of garbage men. I am fed up and it makes me enormously depressed.I never had a problem dating in this city in the past but now I cannot get a foot in the door a word in edgewise and I know it is not me. Even the caliber of personality shared with most women in this city has gotten more judgmental and aggressive. Most of the women that are younger they want money. They want a sugar daddy without realizing that we just came through a pandemic where most people are not as flush with cash anymore due to inflation.Then you have a lot of leftleaning liberal women who will not even talk to a person who is a centrist. Since when did politics have to play a huge role in dating? In the worst of it is the vaccine. If you did not get a vaccine you are basically a piece of shit to everyone who did. And I thought there was a law in place that protected your personal medical privacy. What do I know.What I do know is all of it makes me so depressed and feel so lonely. I am a good guy dedicated intelligent talented. Every single night after the sun sets reality sets into how lonely I really feel. And there is this dark hope inside of me saying there is somebody out there but I really do not think so.We dug our own holes here. we have become so selective so judgmental some materialistic so singleminded our eyes are not open and we push people away. we would rather be alone because we are afraid to catch a virus. we would rather be alone because we do not want to deal with the possibility of somebody losing their job and becoming dependent on the other. we would rather be alone because it is easier to lump everybody into a category that supports a divide that is country wide.Where I agree with most of that and I am an introvert so I understand being alone but damn do I want to hold somebody is hand. the state of dating...,Depression
25937,I have been on these two medications in addition to a low dose of seroquel for sleep for a little over two months. I have noticed an improvement in my anxiety and overall emotion regulation. I am still depressed but not sad if that makes sense? I have all the physical symptoms of depression still lethargy brain fog apathy but I am not as emotional as I used to be. I am experiencing brain fog badly right now. I cannot finish homework. I can hardly get it started. I feel outside of myself. The brain fog is significantly worse than before I started these medications.Has anyone tried this combination of medication and experienced this? What was your experience like? Any additional medications help? I feel like I have improved significantly but this brain fog is way too much.

48258,When does it all stop When do the tears stop. When does this empty feeling stop. When does the erge to selfharm stop. When does the pain stop. Im tired of crying myself to sleep and having no one to talk to about this. They see me happy one day and the following they try list all my triggers. I feel like the only reason i havnt killed myself is because of my sister. Shes the only one that understands why i take the pills. Shes the only one who asks how im going on a specific day. But again she is a child so i know i cannot burden her with these thoughts. And she cannot become the people i need her to be and her words are starting to sound like whispers compared to the screaming pain.Everytime they bring up the pills it makes me feel even more useless than i already feel. Everytime I have to remind someone how to love me i somehoe loose the love i have for myself. I see you trying but its just not enough. When does the pain of it all end. Will i ever be happy in this life? Or should i just give up whiles its still early?,Depression
13484,A common misconception about depression that I feel like does not get talked about much is that just because we can do something one day does not mean we can the next.Just because I could shower yesterday does not mean I can today.Just because I left the house last week does not mean I can this week.Just because I talked to you earlier does not mean I am in the mood now.Just because some days I am not thinking about death does not mean the days when I do make life exhausting.Just because I had motivation does not mean I still do.Depression is not this straight line some days may be better than others. Motivation can come amp go do not let your lows or highs define what you are amp are not capable of. Your best today will not always be the same as yesterday's best that does not mean you are not 'trying your best.' One day you can the next you cannot.,Depression

16617,I am at the lowest point in my life. I have always had women and good friends and a great family. I feel like I am at the end. I have tried to kill myself a couple times when I was in high school but now its just a different feeling. I am just ok with not being here. I feel so fucking alone. I am so just so so desperately sad. 29m,Depression
7624,I have been overposting today for some reason. In a manic mood i supposed or whatever. I have been dealing with a lot lately and even though its been about 34 years since I have relapsed I am feeling very weak today and i think i may break. Like nothing i do seems to give me relief unless its gobbling down a pill or two or just drugs in general. I hate it. I want some kind of change and it hurts knowing that will not happen. I want to be happy not just for the day. But actually FEEL it day after day. Trigger warning,Depression
39027,obviously i know the answer is no and that he is perfectly capable of making his own decision but i feel like i m holding him back and since i can t talk to anyone about it let s do it to some stranger online i deal with anxiety and have emetophobia i ve had it since i wa and it s only gotten worse over the year i m now at this point i can barely get enough food in my system to maintain my weight can t go out to eat and get nervous whenever we eat at family or friend and have to drive back my partner is very understanding and doesn t really care about visiting friend and family often since he is pretty introverted however now that covid is over he would love to travel again i can t the thought of being on a plane trapped inside a cage in the sky is horrible but one i can manage but i ll be in a country with strange food strange place and i ll most likely be on the verge of a panic attack every night my partner say that that s no way to go on holiday a it meant to relax and if i m stressed the whole time there s no point edit he got very frustrated and told me i know it s not your fault but what s the point in having a partner when we can t do anything together i have reached out to get help but waitlist are so long that i have no way of knowing when i ll get help the fun thing is that they ve told me they need me at a healthy weight to start therapy but i ll have to do that without help in the back of my mind i m not very optimistic since therapy hasn t helped the last 0 year either and i ve gotten worse every time we re on the verge of buying a house together and i m just in doubt whether i should go through with it since he deserves much better thanks for listening and helping me get this off my chest,Depression

26664,I hate how when I am feeling really low I start daydreaming about me being in a better place. I look better I am more social nearly all aspects of my are better. And when I start imagining how good it would feel to be like that I actually start getting a bit of motivation because I think you know what it cannot be that hard right? But then I get my head out the clouds and come back to reality. I realize how far deep I am into my depression and how pointless it would be for me to try because its all too much considering how I am feeling. I mean I can barely brush my teeth how the hell would I change my life around? Its like the deeper I sink into the pit of depression the dimmer the light at the end of the tunnel is. Before I know it Ill just be consumed by darkness. The cycle,Depression
21430,What do you have to do to be able to have a sense of belonging?All throughout my life I have never once felt that I belonged somewhere. I have always felt that I am not good enough to be here. I am always the outsider the outlier. For example I live with 5 other friends of mine. Each of them is good at various stuff. Each of them experienced dark days but they would tell me they bounced back. I cannot fathom what it feels like to not give up at least anymore. I do not join clubs because I feel like I do not have the set of skills to be a member of them I cannot make friends because I feel like they do not want me around. I have lost more friends than I can count and I am gradually losing more connections. The few I have left I feel like they are also slowly going. All because I feel like they do not want me around.The most sense of belonging I have felt is on this platform. I have been here for 3y mostly inactive for the first two. But even then I feel like I do not belong here. A sense of belonging,Depression

15959,I want to kill myself. I am tired. I want to go to sleep and never awake. The only reason that I have not attempted it yet is because I have not had a day off where I had nothing to do in a few weeks. My friendships are falling apart I am affecting my relationship in a negative way. Its very evident that I am not happy but I answer every question with I am fine and part of me thinks that I am. I feel more comfortable when I am in this place because I have spent so long here that I know what to expect. Being happy scares me because I do not want it to end and it always does. I am so tired,Depression
14071,I was trying with a girl she was to beautiful for me. But I thought maybe I got a chance she told me your eyes are beautiful we go to a subway to eat a sandwich and after that day she block me. Why? Fucking why? Just block do not told me anything. Fucking God. That shit hurts. I am losing all my confidence. I think I am a fucking weirdo I do not know. She blocked me,Depression
27092,This last month I have been dealing with a lot internally and I have not once taken a moment to decompress without interruption. I am about to start with a new therapist but I keep rearranging my dates and times because I am working two jobs and I have near to no time for myself to be by. my. self. Anxiety attacks are tearing their ugly head for the first time in a long time. I am beating myself over the head trying to leave my toxic job for something that will allow my to leave my home. I took up another job for extra money and it is only eating away at me despite me loving the job I have worked there on an off for 5 years almost. I am dealing with a loss of a grandparent that I have been slipping into bouts of sadness and grief when I am at my lowest. I have been crying more than everyday because I feel like an absolute in terms of a career. I need time. I have none. I feel like I am sinking and slipping. Time,Depression
8130,I work six days a week. I have been since November. I have been doing lots of overtime since Covid came into our lives. I pretty much gave up on trying to finish this semester at WGU. I have experienced a lot of grief and loss this year trauma routine changes and I am having more horrible days at work than okay days. I have to convince myself daily to not call in as Id feel guilty and still not enjoy the day away from work. I am burnt out. I think its time for a new job. I miss snuggling my cat. My grandmother passed two weeks before my cat. Sold most of my stuff to move and then lost one of my good friends in a shooting in April.I am all over the place and I want to be left alone or maybe not asked to do anything else. I am too in my feelings to play video games or watch TV. I do not want to go anywhere but I know existing on the couch waiting for bedtime is not good either. I keep making therapy appointments. I schedule them for two hours later than I should finish my work shift but something always seems to come up that makes me just a few min too late to have the session. I am not sure what I am looking for here. I am just tired. I am tired,Depression

7143,I think I have been depressed for a little over 5 years now and as I am returning to the world due to COVID winding down in my area I am starting to see how the isolation and negative thoughts are affecting me physically and emotionally. I finally went to get my drivers license a little less than a month ago and on the way to take the road test I just started feeling awful like I the weight of the world was bearing down on me slowly crushing me. I felt my limbs go numb and the urge to vomit was creeping in along with tears beginning to cloud the edges of my vision. I have never felt as out of control of my body as I did that day it was definitely a first for me. I have never had a good outlet for all the feelings I suppress and its awful to feel that you cannot trust those closest to you I love my parents deeply but I cannot trust them with the truth and it would only make them worry. Oddly I have found that self flagellation helps calm my mind I get no pleasure from it and I do not beat myself bloody but pain helps me focus and take my mind away from darker trains of thought. I am going to be applying for a job in a few days and that is what is currently the main source of stress in my life right now. If I land the job it will mean moving away to pursue the work but on the other hand I think getting away from my family and having my own space will ultimately do me some good in the long haul. I cannot fail afford to fail here I need to keep moving forward.I do not really want to die I just want the pain to stop. Crossroads,Depression
18538,I am at that point I feel. I am slowly getting worse and worse and I have not gotten better at all. I have been getting more and more tired. I sleep in later and even then I am still half awake during the day. Eventually I will be too tired to end it and then I will be stuck. I am going on vacation next week and we will probably go to some nice hotel. A nice big and hopefully tall enough hotel. I have to do it now or it will be too late,Depression
9693,I have been trying different antidepressants recently mostly SSRIs and everytime I quit taking them in the first week or so. I just cannot handle the side effects severe dizziness and this overwhelming feeling of inner unrest. So after doing some research I found St. John's Wort which according to one meta analysis I found is as effective as common antidepressants but with much less side effects. Thirtyfive studies examining 6993 patients ... evaluated St. Johannes Wort SJW. The herb SJW was associated with more treatment responders than placebo. Compared to antidepressants SJW participants were less likely to experience adverse events with no difference in treatment effectiveness in mild and moderate depression. Study looks really promising to me. I am currently taking about 700mg a day and I only experience very mild inner unrest here and there but nothing major. I hope to God that this will finally help me a bit. I will definitely update you guys if you wish. St. John's Wort is severely underestimated in my opinion,Depression

22084,I am currently on 2mg of abilify aripiprazole which i pretty recently started as an antidepressant booster. However I have been sleeping pretty terribly waking up in the middle of the night andor waking up super early and having trouble falling back to sleep. now beforehand I had chronic insomnia in that I had trouble falling asleep but when I was out I was out. I treat this with cannabis which works like a charm for falling asleep but is not helping this issue.In the meantime before I see my psychiatrist I am curious to known is this usually an issue that persists? even in the short time I have been on this drug my mood and outlook have been way better to the point where people have told me they noticed a difference. I would hate to have to stop it so any insight is welcome thanks!! Abilify really helps with depression but is making sleeping difficult,Depression
19108,The other day. Depressive emotions overwhelmed me. Shrugged them off like other thoughts and moved on. Later. I realized I cannot.Processing thoughts in itself become hard. Much less insignificant habits of not wanting to do anything. I wished it remained there.... it did not.I had begun traversing to unknown territory desiring the comfort of nonexistence. Cherished this thought like it is home for me. Normalizing Wanting life is like crying from a happy dream. it is never reality.do not get me wrong suicide is not in my options. Me dreading existence is not me loving human death. Experiences in life are precious. Feelling emotions which a rock cannot feel is a meritkind of. I love happiness but feel burdened by my past my experiences and my existence. To embracing the hypothetical world of no me. Daydreaming the noeverwashere. IDK. Therapist is not an option either. I am 19 dependent on my parents who I tried to get me checked up for ADHD but received my veryhappy news of me possessed and should real the holy book etc. Am I really depressed?,Depression
12055,Left my role as a support worker at the start of this month due to getting an electrical apprenticeship which I have been trying to get for about 6 months now. Been really happy with it up until 2 weeks ago have not heard from my boss at all tried contacting him and nothing. Tried to go back to my old job and my shifts have been filled extremely stressed at the moment. I am 23 years old and trying to build a better future for myself but been fucked around and now out of a job pretty much. Extremely stressed.,Depression
14049,Please ... some of you are not going to like what I am about to write but please keep your shamming and negativity to yourself. Its really just the last thing I need right now. I am married. Kids. Late 30s and have been unhappy for years. I have struggled with depression since I was 1516. On and off medication. And have been to therapy many times. I turned to finding someone online to fill the voids of my unhappy marriage. And this is the part I know most of you will disapprove of and I get it. I have talked to quite a few people online over the years. Male. Female. Made some friends. Had my heart broken. Recently I met a man online. Our connection was instant. And you can say or think what you want but i genuinely love him. Were a lot a like. I came to learn he also battles depression and anxiety. But we dealSo differently. Hes become my best friend. I would tell him anything and everything but he shuts me out. He does not tell me anything. Its so hard for me. I do not know how to support him. I do not want to turn my back on him because hes currently going through a really rough patch but he just shuts me out. He says he wants me in his life but I do not know how to be what he needs. Especially when i too have been having really bad days. I feel like we need each other. Like there is a reason we connected but being shut out makes me feel like crap. I have told no one this but the past couple of weeks while driving I have literally thought to myself just pull out in front of that car. Just do it. These are not suicidal thoughts but more .... I am just sick of putting everybody else first and maybe being hurt and laying in bed recovering would help put me first. I could stop putting all my energy on everyone else for even just a little. I know. Its crazy. This man I mentioned does not know this is how I have been feeling. I cannot stand the thought of him thinking it has anything to do with him. Or him worrying about me when hes got enough on his plate. I thought we would understand each other better than most people could I thought wed be able to support each other in our bad times. I cannot lose him. But maybe were both just too broken. New here and just need to vent.,Depression
40017,i dont want to move at all i just want to be stationary for the rest of my life school is actually so draining and i can t bring myself to do anything my parent think so highly of me a if i m really smart i don t think i deserve any kindness from them i ve disappointed them a lot i wonder quite a lot why they haven t disowned me yet i dont know what to do anymore i don t have any friend whom i can call close it s so lonely but i feel like i deserve this for all the pain i ve caused for so many people but the worst thing is i feel like im doing this just for attention and i feel like a horrid human being because there are people who are actually suffering from these horrible thought i just want to fade out of existence,Depression
15536,22 yo M moved to a new state halfway across the country with a sort of friend from middle school I say sort of because the only context of us hanging out was either to smoke a blunt or just at a party I have always been cool with him but we have never been like best friends or anything. I am posting this because although he is my roommate i still feel incredibly alone. Through this time spent alone being about the last year or so of total isolation before we got a lease about 3 months ago I have learned that i do not really have any friends. None of my close friends from home have even called me or texted me hardly. In response to this I have left all groupchats and anything else involving them as I should not have to be friends with them just because we have hung out for 10 years or so especially if they do not care about what I am doing or how I am doing constantly I am seeing them check on eachother and it makes me feel incredibly left out but it makes me think that maybe they just do not think that I needwant to be checked on. Whatever maybe this is a hole only i have put myself in but i still think if i even did have one true friend someone would have asked to come hangout. I moved to a pretty tourist destination place with legal weed so all my homies when i initially moved here all said they wanted to plan trips and yadda yadda yadda of course none of which ever was actually an intention. My roommate however has had multiple friends make time to come out here and spend time with him. Maybe i am a fucking sack of shit and i just do not see it. My issue is not wanting my friends back. I have decided to just grow myself and my abilities but all I have been is depressed and unmotivated and self loathing. I have no flame within me anymore for any sort of creative passions or ideas even. I just want to know how to meet people covid has made things weird and i went actively looking on friday to multiple bars in my area only to find that i was the youngest at just about every one. I do not know what i need really certainly not mentally in a place to have a girlfriend although the comfort of having that would obviously be nice but what kind of woman wants a man who is depressed and unmotivated with no plans. currently my day to day routine since i was also fired from my job as a office administrator has been wake up shower gym eat shower lay in bed and stare into the void and take depression naps. I have tried drawing on my ipad or making videos and i just end up sitting at my desk with my head in my hands thinking about what if i died and how peaceful that may be. In death there would be no stress to have these connectionsrelationships I feel like part of me feels that it is a massive flaw to need others simply for my own maintenance it feels incredibly dependent and i hate that. I am always willing to give myself and all of my attention and help to anyone i would think is a friend and never in my life have i felt that reciprocated never have i felt like a bullet would be caught in return. I am a simp for human connection and i feel that with this literal entire year without minus a couple tinder dates i feel so bad almost sick. I do not know if this is a rant or what but i would appreciate tips for anyone who maybe has been in this place before and what helped you get through. 22yo Feels like the end already.,Depression
16640,I posted this on multiple threads. I hope it can help someone.Hi!I just wanted to share a book that really helped me on my journey with depression and anxiety. I think it is a must read. I even recommended it to my therapist and she went out and bought it. it is called the mood cure by Julia Ross. It explains the physical aspects of depression and anxiety in your body. It shows you natural supplements you can take if you do not want to go down the medication route. It even has a quiz to determine what type of depression you have. Hope this helps! A book that changed my life and taught me about depression and anxiety Tip,Depression
25261,I am a person who tends to think of their feelings often and pick them apart. Recently I noticed that rather than my normal depressive symptoms a run around the block of the more common issues I have been feeling sad a different kind of sad than usual. Ordinarily my sad means sensitive easily brought down and more heavy in a general way. As of late sad has meant crying constantly literally crying myself to sleep some nights. And I do not know what changed. I am now on the verge of tears for most of the day and I do not even have my happy moments anymore. I was diagnosed with depression 2 years ago bouncing between each specific diagnosis. Now I am on medication that was working just fine. I have not found any new significant stressors in my life that I could identify the only recent change was a change in my asneeded anxiety medication. I have no idea what happened but I do not know how to cope anymore. Has anyone else gone through something similar where their depression suddenly twists and changes? Feeling a new kind of sad,Depression
19984,Some days ago I decided to stop masturbating and watching porn because I think I was addicted to it after that I sleep better I have more energy and more of those positive things but I just realized what have changed since I stopped? nothing I am lonely I am miserable and I am still a worthless piece of shit. there is no woman in the earth that would love me so there is any benefit in stop masturbating? I am just stopped having that self pleasure and that false feeling of having a loot of partners to fuck maybe I am a little more healthier now but not more happy so what is the point?Maybe I should keep watching porn anyway it is impossible for me to even talk to a girl and after all the porn I have watched I do not think I can even be satisfied with a normal relationship because I was into hardcore stuff.I am sorry if something here does not make sense I am not a native English speaker just wanted to vent out here where nobody knows me. Porn addiction. Why even try to improve if I am lonely?,Depression
23644,I am sad some days and some days I am happy and some days I am whatever. When I am sad I will cry and be in a bad mood for a couple days then be better once it passes and think I was being dumb or over dramatic for being so sad. When I am happy I love going out with friends and doing stuff and I will enjoy myself and when I am neither then I just think whatever about the situation. Idk if this is counts as depression or not.I have been like this most of my life and have not talked to anyone about it really. Like a therapist or anything Do you have to be sad all the time to be 'depressed',Depression
8425,Tyson fury and countless other champions had to get through it why would it be any easier for me this D actually hurted me so much but still teached me so many life lessons but still I am on my knees each time i get up I am scared so i do not try anymore fearing that this will not work. Being for 1 hours on the ground tasting all kind of emotions anger pain tears..

13206,Hey everyone so thier is something more to my sadness that I need to tell you guys about so I have been seeing alot of fucked up shit recently like some serious fucking awful things something that you would not consider human. I have been seeing it on YouTube Mangas animes and movies the type there are so fucked up and graphic that they get banned in alot of different countries.And when I saw what was happening in those things I break down and cry because the person who is being put through that pain does not deserve it I wish I could just jump into the T.V comics Manga anime movie and just save that person. I know that is dumb to think and it is not healthy either but back then I was a fucking horrible person and I hate my past self for it every sing day and I wish I could apologize to the people that I hurt. And when I saw those things I break down and cry because nobody at all deserves to be knocked to the ground and be treated like a play thing.But that is not all because not only am I sad I am also scared the shit I saw was some like deep web live stream were they torture and violate the person they are doing it to and I imagine myself being in that terrifying andni do not want that happenings to me or anyone else because that is sickening.And the fact that it is real makes it even more scary because now I am afraid of going outside at night while having the fear of being kidnapped and I just want these bad things in my head to stop already. Please I need help and I am afraid! I just want these bad things in my head to go away so I can feel safe again!!! I want these bad thoughts put of my head.,Depression

12604,it is like I have lost the energy to just.. exist. I am not even able to do simple things like watch my favorite shows or play my favorite games. it is more of a chore than something to enjoy.I kind of just lay in bed all day and do nothing. I have been stuck in a really bad rut and I do not really know how to get out of it. The approach of school soon are not really helping it either. I am not sure what I will do when it comes to studying considering I barely have the energy to get up and shower some days. Boy what a mess. I am really tired all the time.,Depression
23193,Seriously is it normal cry everyday 23 times a day? I do not remember it being like this a few years ago. A lot of things has happened which is unfixable and cannot do much about it but still it feels weird. I do not remember the last time i felt happy. I am feeling guilty all the time about everything. I am 27 now and i remember the last time i felt good i was 23. Should i take any medication? I used to judge people that thought of suicide but damn it looks like it would fix things. Is this normal?,Depression
13459,Hi rDepressionLet me introduce myself. I am a 26 years old guy and I have been dealing with minor depression since I was about 18 years old. I have been into therapy about two years ago and within two weeks I am starting it up again because things have been going downhill lately. I need a new job I need to move somewhere else I need some fucking love but I am just fucking stuck. People always tell me it will get better but how long is it going to take? I would love to believe it but it takes a lot of fucking time. I am not suicidal or anything thank god but I have done stupid shit like driving really fast at night on an empty road and turning off the lights and just blast into oblivion. Deep down inside I know it is a scream for attention or an urge to feel a kind of peculiar 'romantic' feeling. And it never lasts for more than three to five seconds before you snap out of it. Anyways that is not supposed to be me. I am still at the same place where I was a couple of years ago. Looking back things have not improved that much despite hard fucking work. So what do I fucking do? I hope I get lucky one day in the future but it has not happened yet. All my friends get lucky... The whole ordeal is not theendoftheworldbad but it just sucks so much. I really do not know what to do. Luckily I do have very happy days! Days where I feel me again a confident smart and handsome guy. But on days like these it just eats up everything. Is there any short term solution to get things going again? do not tell me to read a book or to go play the guitar do something I like because that is only possible if my mind is in the right place. The only thing that would help is I think a miracle. Where are my miracles? Like suddenly being able to move on because of sheer coincidence because you found someone or something you love. It happens to the people I know. Well not me. I was given the option of taking citalopram by my general practitioner and I thought about it but I will not take it. For three reasons 1 They do not work on everyone 2 If one is to take them it must be for a long period of time 3 I do not want to get dependent. I might take them in the future but let us first see my psychologist.Perhaps I can talk a little with you in here ask me questions or anything because I am not able to really pinpoint everything. there is pages and pages of feelings in what I mentioned above but I just cannot paint the whole picture. What the absolute fuck do I do right now? Depressed need some help. Or better a miracle. I just want to talk...,Depression
12912,Now I just wish I had a shoulder to cry into. To hold someone is hand or have someone hug me. I do not even care if they only see me as income and not a real human.

First time I heard that there were people who pay people to cuddle with them because they are so lonely I laughed.,Depression

15099,there is been nothing worth my time in a long time. Back when I was a kid it used to be american football for some time. Hanging out with friends made me me feel engaged after that. Later on I fell in love with dark souls so I spend all my time on the wikis trying out builds after build and doing pvp then watching compilations. it is hard for me to get the creativity of searching up something interesting on youtube so I drift endlessly in the recommended sections and watch my subs videos. This is no way to live. Youtube everyday for no reason is driving me bonkers. What do I do in this case? I cannot make friends the way my life is and jobs are out of question because of my illness. that is for sure. I have nothing to live for,Depression

47461,Is it not terrifying for anyone else? To know that I have to experience every piece of suffering in this universe multiplied out by every possible universe that exists I.e. infinite suffering awaits everything and everyone and I have to just tell myself that that balances with the infinite good or whatever. Just wondering if anyone else has had heavy thoughts about existence that dont add up to anything good or if theres some kind of secret combination of words that will undo the past 10 years of overlyanalytical loneliness and selfdirected toxic masculinity I fucking hate the fact that I fucking hate everything theres no escape,Depression

12569,I do not know when it started but I found out that my father and all of my relatives in his side do not believe in mental illnesses. It was in 8th grade when I started showing signs of depression and I got into this rebellious phase this is also where he started texting me how he will beat me and wished that I was never his daughter because I was not normal. He was not in the country at that time so he was not able to touch me. I never told my mother I felt like nobody could not accept me and it affected my performance in school and my relationship with other people.Fast forward at the beginning of my time as in 11th grade I was diagnosed with depression and I even had to lie to some of the doctor's questions so that the results will not be worse. I was given a letter to see a Psychiatrist and now I am about to start college and I still never went. I still remember how my father threatened to beat me and make sure that almost all of my teeth fell off if he finds out that I have not been acting like a normal teenagerI had a fight with him again this quarantine and even though I am agnostic that night I thanked God because he was not in the country and he was not able to hurt me. He kept saying that I was a mistake and an embarrassment. Everyone in the family just excused it as his way of saying he loves me because he just wants the best for me and it is just because of high blood that he could not control what he saysI want to run away. I hate everyone in this house. And even though that my mother is the only reason I am living I hate her the most for letting him treat me like this. For a woman who showed me how strong she was by not relying on my father's money and embodied independence she is the weakest person ever.Until this day I have never heard an apology from him. Only material gifts which was his way of saying you cannot hate me I bought you this expensive itemHe poured his money on me while I was growing up and I hated myself for that because now I cannot even stand up alone in the outside world now without finding them and relying on their helpI am such a failure Parents that do not believe in mental illnesses,Depression
24478,Just why? I can sleep 10 houers still fall asleep at day and still being sooo deamn fucking tired. Why is existence so tiering?,Depression
26488,that is all that keeps coming into my head life just is not fun anymore so why bother? I seriously had thoughts of just drowning myself out with a bottle of whiskey and a bottle of pills tonight but decided to at least just see what tomorrow brings. The cherry on top? Its my birthday on Mondayand I could not give less of a fuck about it. I have been paycheque to paycheque the past year I am always just flat tire or something minuscule happening away from losing everything. Meanwhile all over social are people on vacations sitting on their decks in the sun camping going out for dinner. None of this is fun for me anymore so what would be so wrong with just being done with all this? I have already decided to call in a mental health day tomorrow. I am just going to try to sleep and hopefully thisll be a dwindling feeling in the morning. None of this is fun anymore,Depression

23425,Today was the last straw. I had enough mental abuse from my nparents. I could not take the mental anguish anymore so when the time was right I decided to take all my things and leave. My plan was just to keep going north till I get to South Carolina but now I am just really scared. Scared that my parents and relatives will find me. In fact I have had a few panic attacks while I was driving. I sorta give up at this point I just do not know what to do with anything anymore. Right now I am at fucking gas station in a different county and I feel very paranoid. I hate how I cannot just have good people in my life who will not find some way to abuse me. I do not understand how people do this running away. Do they not get caught ? I do not know. I have never felt more paranoid and scared in my life. If I go back it will be 1000 times more mental abuse than I received before. I am going to find a way to kms soon because now all I feel is great pain. Who ever said LiFe Is A gIfT is a fucking moron ! I ran away from home,Depression
48034,You gave your all only for it fail. Why bother? You finally got your dream job then layoffs come. Fall in love then get divorced. Always back to square 1.

That's what it feels like. Anything good is coincidental fleeting and temporary. Suffering is a lifetime and consistent.,Depression

38651,i have been suffering for eight long month after a girl i thought would be interested in being my girlfriend ended thing and left me out to dry it wa a pretty short span of dating and hooking up we talked during the summer and only saw each other in person for a few week but the aftermath ha been the worst thing i ve ever gone through in my entire life i have alienated myself from her because i couldn t stop texting her and asking what i did wrong or saying thing i thought i did to make her not interested and expect her to confirm i am on a no contact basis with her now which is probably for the best because i don t think she even cared that much about me to begin with i can t handle the fluidity of dating how people can just leave something if it isn t working out for them for whatever reason and not know what that reason is i ve already come up with every possible situation or reason in my head that it didn t work out and it s honestly been driving me over the edge since last summer i can t take this anymore luckily it s never gotten so bad that i threatened her with suicide because i remember her saying she had an ex who did that to her and it sound like an awful thing to have done to you but that thought did cross my mind where i wanted to present that a an ultimatum to her if she couldn t just tell me what the exact reason or reason were she wanted to end it but i would never actually do that due to it being shitty to put another person through it s not enough for me to accept that we lived more than three hour from each other or she had a bad long term relationship end and wasn t trying to get into anything serious or she told me she wa feeling suffocated by me it s like the spongebob episode with patrick s secret box i just want so badly to hear what it might have been like she would tell her girl friend behind closed door no matter how bad it might sting or hurt but i know i ll never know precisely what she wa thinking it is so difficult to just move on or let it go like people always say for dating situation like this that to me just sound impossible i just hate dating i hate how some people have such ease jumping from date to date or going on multiple date with multiple people at once or talking to many people at one time it just make me feel so overwhelmed and upset that that seems to be the norm in society i can t take it it make me want to die just knowing that s what i m going to have to deal with if i want to have any hope of finding someone to be with let alone get over this last girl,Depression
39976,this isn t the normal kind of post i would write and my follower are probably going to leave because of this but here i am most of the time i have the thought in passing if i were dead i wouldn t have to deal with all of this or life is just too hard i wish i wasn t here lately thing in my life have gotten really bad i had a miscarriage in january it sucked because my husband and i had been trying to get pregnant for a long time and had been told that it wasn t going to be possible without intervention or weight loss or both but there we were pregnant and all of a sudden not pregnant i spent the last year dealing with some drama at work that took me over the edge more than a few time i wanted to kill myself so badly but i never told anyone about it i d mention to my therapist that i wa having the suicidal thought and he d check in but i reassured him that i d be ok and he would remind me of all the time i had been here before and gotten out of it now i m looking at a tough situation at home i am not going to go into detail about it but thing are hard at the moment and i find myself feeling trapped unwanted and like more of an annoyance than anything it suck to feel that way in your own home i honestly don t know what i m doing any more and the suicidal thought are getting more real and more pervasive i am finding it hard to stay in a good place i m finding it hard to think logically about it all i feel is desperation and a strong desire to just end it to be done with the fight of having to live with constant depression and anxiety just having rest from that would be a relief but also i know i shouldn t do it life suck and it shouldn t be this hard wish i could feel loved supported and like my life actually matter yet here i am,Depression

47286,No motivation As the title says i have lost motivation to do anything in life.I can write thousands of word but i will try to keep it short.I used to have keen interest in music and astronomy.. i loved watching movies and tv shows too. But since last 45 months it's like nothing excites me anymore. I can't enjoy anything now.I feel bored with myself whenever i am talking with someone they get bored of me which is obvious because i never have anything to talk about. Everything feels so bland.And even when i think about how i can inculcate some new hobbies in me.. it doesn't really help me feel any better.It feels like.. there is nothing left in this world that can satisfy me or give me purpose atleast.,Depression
12910,Am I depressed if I feel really lonely all the time? I am just not sure. I do not get out much being a stay at home mom trying to keep distance from others for the sake of my son's health as he is too young to get vaccinated. When my husband is not working that is all he wants to do is play games. I know I signed up to be a gamers wife and it usually does not bother me but I just feel so alone. Yeah I am with my son 247 but he is a yr old. I have never really had friends to talk to the only ones I have really clicked with moved away. I am 1500 miles from my entire family so I really have no one besides my husband and kid. I just cannot help but feel lonely does that make me depressed? Is that just the circumstances? I do not know. I just know I feel alone. Am I?,Depression
10303,I do not condone suicide but I need to share something. It could be a long post. I have cerebral palsy. Not the severest not the lightest case but visible and affecting my movement. I cannot walk if there is no one to help me maintain balance. No cure for this AFAIK.My family never supported me emotionally regarding my disability. I have no supporting community in my real life. I am 26 so it is a little late for me to don my pink optimistic glasses on. My past is a fact. Lonely and full of bullying. Little to experience with significant others. I guess ablebodied people find me sexually unattractive. Given that even I could not see myself giving someone a chance if I strongly dislike their looks I suppose some people work like that. I get the exercise do yoga or it is your fault plus the occasional or you will be reincarnated in a similar body very often. I tried rehabilitation but the arduous process leads to nothing that could be deemed a motivating goal. My physiotherapist congratulates me upon being able to use my legs muscles to stand up from a chair. Awesome achievement indeed. I probably deserve a medal for that. If there was anything I could do to get closer to the standard of a sexy young male I guess I would do it. But nopez. Me training means me suffering in order to gain some basic abilities and it is not 100 even that would work as expected. This body is awful. So I expect I will either die alone or have to marry someone who is also undateable. Given my past traumas I think I would be a weird partner to be with anyway.I am otherwise somewhat successful but that brings joy. Amidst all of this I should have the motivation to work on my PhD while living in one of the bad places to be disabled in postSoviet Eastern Europe. Mom does not want to immigrate so I guess I am stuck here.Honestly it is so bad that I cannot even kill myself. I wake up day after day trying my best to do my job and seem fine while seeing literally every other person around me pursue the goal of a relationsip family or have one and attempt to be happy. Or all those people who seem happy. Family and relationships are the meaning of life unless one could be a monk.Seeing that I am not that much interested in Eastern Orthodox Christianity or any Christian dogma in general that is not an option either. Not that anyone cares. Life in society has accepted me as an observer who sacrifices their labour and gets a little money in return. And so the years shall go it seems. I have waited for better days far too long. it is easier to dissmiss someone disabled.All I want is for this to end. I wish no hell nor paradise just the ending of this. I have 0 control of how whether my death makes others suffer my suffering makes them go away anyway. If there is any spiritual essence in me I would like that to serve its purpose or whatever the truth is.But I cannot bear all the suffering in utter loneliness. Giving all and getting little. Always doomed to being an outcast however strong my wish to simply belong. I wish euthanasia was legal but alas. Sometimes suicide IS the only actual option,Depression
39218,my doctor said they d like to talk about my bloodwork so i have an appointment tomorrow of course this wa this morning and now my brain is gone to over drive i spent all day sleeping with no motivation to eat drink get up i managed to get a bath but i also have a test tomorrow that i need studying for that call could just be anything but i m worried it s something absolutely terrible anyone else feel like this any advice,Depression
23297,After dealing with this disease since 2006 I attempted to hang myself. I tied it off around the doorknob and leaned forwards. I guess I did not far enough though because as I started to blackout my legs caught the weight. Now idk what to do. Should I try again? It finally happened,Depression
14965,I spend more and more time in my bed as the time goes on. Not because I want to I just lose strenght to give up. I cannot eat I cannot shower it is hard for me to even get up to get on my PC. it is hard to move a muscle it is like something is sucking energy off me and I have none left to function properly. I am scared I spend so much time in my room and I feel like I am going to root here to the death. Even if I manage to leave the room I am filled with anxiety I am scared and want to go back as soon as I leave. I do not know what is going to become of me at this rate. I feel like I am going to be paralyzed at this rate,Depression
47244,Are we Supportive or destructive Throwaway because the people in this post have reddit accounts. I 28F am married to a wonderful man 32M lets call him Mark. We have been married for 7 years now and I grew very close to his family as they live in the same city as us while my family is in another country.His brother Maison 30M and I grew very close and we have a great friendship laughing together talking about life etc as time went by I started noticing that i was being supportive and there for him and the opposite isnt true.Now for a little backstory Maison went through a very tough phase in his life and got depressed and suicidal he went to therapy and started getting back on his feet again but he was never the same. This happened 3 years ago and after that experience he became very selfcentered inconsiderate yet very sensitive and also does not accept any type of criticism. He literally turned to a manchild. Only wants to game all day doesnt help the people around him is very dependent even in the smallest things. Mark is always walking on eggshells around him for this reason because he is scared that he would say do anything that will cause Maison to relapse into depression.I on the other hand am a little tougher on Maison. I sometimes feel like his family not saying anything when he is rude or acting like a child because they are afraid to hurt his feelings are turning him into a very immature and irresponsible man who is never held accountable.He moved in to live with us temporarily to save some rent money till he gets his life together. He adopted a dog and let her go because he didnt train her properly and she became aggressive with separation anxiety. Then he adopted another dog and the same thing happened again and he let him go. He wants so many things in his life but wouldnt want to put the hard work or the responsibility.My question is should we go easy on him because of his mental health? Or is going easy on him will make his life harder later because he will get used to life without any responsibility or accountability?,Depression
18636,this sounds terribly absurd. yet i cry everynight because of it. I have never paid much attention to my ethnicity until i started noticing that when people referred to asians they only meant the east asians. i feel disgusting and it leads to the point where i hurt myself because of it. i scream to the point where i cannot talk anymore and i just feel so worthless because of this. i feel as though i am a waste of life. i do not know what to do. i wish i was east asian. not southeast.,Depression
22283,Just a little about me before you read this Hi I am Noah. I am 15 years old and I live in a small place outside of a city called Manchester in the NorthWest of England.I seem to get these depressive 'episodes' where I tend to feel like crap for weeks at a time but I then get a small burst of happiness for about a week solid where I feel like I can actually stand the problems I am facing in life. I am currently not feeling too bad right now and I have not been feeling awful for the past 2 days but I am just waiting for my mood to completely drop sometime soon. Is this normal...? Depressive episodes.,Depression
16874,Since I was eleven maybe younger I have dealt with odd crying spells a lack of motivation an ache in my chest when I cry so badly it feels like a hammer was thrown into my sternum a habit of self destruction and sometimes a sense of selfishness so intense I am amazed I still have a family to hug.As I have gotten older things have gotten easier in some aspectsmore difficult in others. I have always felt safe when I sleep though. When I sleep I do not have to deal with the emotional dysfunction brought by my ADHD which if I had not been diagnosed and medicated I am not sure if Id still be here nor do I have to deal with other people. I love my family and I love my boyfriend but I feel bad for existing as I am sometimes.I do not like having sad thoughts pop into my head. I do not enjoy crying for hours in my car at 6AM. I have never liked the headache I get after I cry for so long and get it all out. Sadness is such a bother.I still do not quite have a grasp on how I am going to manage once I am living on my own or I do not have insurance but I know that thinking about it for too long can trigger the crying and freaking out. I know that thinking about the future too intensely as a whole can trigger the crying and freaking out. I do not want to cry and freak out anymore. I wish I had been born into wealth so often. And I know that the economic side of things is such a root because for what MUST be a majority of the population. This can make me cry and freak out too thinking about how unfair it all is.In the 10 years I have been feeling this way I still do not know what the whole lesson is supposed to be. I may never learn the lesson. Maybe I am the lesson to everyone else? Sounds kind of dumb tho.I do not want to be sad. I want to be happy. I want to laugh from my belly when I watch TV and I want to be able to listen to more music and feel comfortable singing. I want to live in my own place and fill it with plants. I might want to have kids some day and end the generational trauma once and for all. I write about my future to keep myself hopeful in the present. I do not. Want. To. Be. Alone.Thanks for letting me vent. Hah. I have had Major Depressive Disorder for 10 years.,Depression
19606,Since I cannot find a way to end it all I am going to say this Fock Neighborhood Nip. Nip.seeey Husssle. Lol got Nipped. When he got kicked that made me laugh.

20490,I have chronic depression anxiety and soontobe diagnosed ADHD. I have tried therapy on and off throughout my life but after a few months I get sick of it. I have been doing therapy over the phone once a week. At first I was excited and now I dread it. I am an introvert and I do not like talking so a whole hour of it is torture for me. I also noticed that venting makes me feel worse instead of better. I want to stop therapy but I know if I do Ill eventually get even worse. I am not taking any meds at the moment because I tried 3 different antidepressants already and none worked for very long. What do I do? Just toughen it out? I do not think therapy is for me,Depression
20110,I have been playing video games all my life and they have been a staple hobby for me. At some point along the road of mental illness I think they stopped being mainly a hobby and turned into a coping mechanism. it is one thing to be bored of a hobby but it is a completely different thing to be bored of a coping mechanism. It feels like such a struggle to feel happy playing games now and when I actually manage to enjoy my time it is never long. As I have grown up I have developed very specific preferences for the way I play my games if I cannot fulfill those preferences it is value as a coping mechanism is void. The longest a single game has lasted for me in the past 45 years has been 3 weeks before I lost all interest and began a desperate search for my next game to play. When you have been going through this cycle for a while you run out of games to hop to and you run out of ways to cope. I do not know what I have to change I wish my preferences for these games would just go away I do not know if it is maybe some form of OCD or just some strange sideeffect of depression fucking with the pleasure center of my brain. I do not want videogames to be a coping mechanism anymore I do not want to have to cope. it is gotten much worse recently games are only lasting a couple days max and I am losing motivation to even search for more. I just cannot stand to deal with this anymore. it is so hard to enjoy things now,Depression
47262,How long does it take to know if an antidepressant is going to work or I need to try a different one? Ive tried 4 now where they made it worsethe side effects where unbearable but now Ive been on sertraline and the side effects are tolerable but hasnt helped with my anxiety or depression. Its been 4 weeks and today the nurse practitioner gave me the choice to try something else or increase the dose. I asked her what I should do but she said it was up to me. I didnt know what I should do so I just said increase the dose because the pills are cheap and I have to pay full price for everything until I hit my deductible. I dont know if a month is too short to know or if should be seeing a little improvement by now. Im starting to think I should have chose a different medicine but I dont know maybe I am jumping the gun here and I should just stick it out. This medicine makes me really tired,Depression
8717,How do you guys fight it? I get sad sometimes and it just stays. I want it to go but it does not bother to go away. No one is there to help. Loneliness is eating me alive. Why do I feel lonely even though I have a girlfriend? I have no idea. I do not always feel lonely just sometimes ig. This sucks this really sucks. I get suicidal sometimes but that would be selfish. But I cannot see the point anymore. What am I doing with my life? I am loved I think. Just little things affect me a lot sometimes like a bullet I think. it is not fair on people who care for me if I die but it should not be like that. I wish I could just erase my existence like stop my parents from conceiving me. that would be cool. I think I am overreacting but I am a sensible person. I tried getting help but my gp never got back to me. It sucks because I got accused of that I do not help myself. I tried and I did help myself. do not accuse people who are struggling I never do that because I know it has bad implications. If you are in a relationshipdo not guilt trip your SO over something they have no control over. that is all. Take care fellas My chest feels hollow,Depression

9251,hey. I am not really sure what is been going on with me but for the last 1.5 2ish years I have just been feeling very not like myself. I am sad constantly crying practically everyday half the time i do not even know why I am upset and i do not really have real motivation to do anything. i feel like I am falling behind because all of my friends are doing actual productive things and I am just moping around in my room every. single. day. it feels like I am never actually happy but just distracted from my sadness?I am starting to lose friends because i do not enjoy going outside and doing things it feels like I am worthless and it feels like I am dissapointing my family. I am not sure if this is the right place to be writing down these thoughts I am not diagnosed with anything but i know the depression symptoms and it seems like it could possibily be what I am experiencing ? I am not sure though because I am not suicidal or anything like that. its more just emptyness.any thoughts? advice? idk depression?,Depression
8854,For more than a year now I have been waking up feeling like shit. Most of times there no apparent reason it has become kind of a morning ritual. My head pounds I feel extreme sadness and I really struggle to go about my daily chores. The situation improves as the day progresses and by mid daynoon I am able to do my job without much problem.But recently the morning depression has been getting worse accompanied by vivid dreaming every night. Now when I wake up I am more depressed than ever sometimes I think why did I stop dremaing why I had to wake up and I will not lie some bad thoughts have crossed my mind recently. Feeling really helpless now what should I do? Waking up everyday in the morning seems like literal torture with my head pounding and a mood so bad it makes me wonder is it worth living?,Depression

9458,I show no love to myself. In fact I blame myself for everything. I shame myself for my own actions. I do not believe in myself. I hate myself. So much so that if my reflection jumped out of a mirror I would attack me and fight me until one of us was dead...to which the victor would still be me and still be alone. And come to the realization that there is a new me in the mirror and one can only ever kill the other leaving one left. There is no way to completely extingish myself for good. I am doomed to keep killing myself without relief......I am miserable. I had a weird but depressing thought...,Depression

9332,Do you all ever feel like your head is going to explode with all the thoughts and idea crawling inside? I consider myself a pretty logical person I love to find answer to things and do research a reason why I love school. When it comes to my own purpose the human purpose why were here how everything was created etc I want to dig and dig and dig but it just becomes a cluster inside of my head. I feel like I am trying to dig in into my brain but I am being held back. I feel sad most of the days as I am trying so much to help myself and others I feel helpless some days and others I try to cope with the idea that there is meaning in my existence I just might never know the true purpose of life. At the end I feel empty miserable that I cannot figure out my questions. I have tried to find peace in the universe and creating my own spirituality with what makes sense and has logic. But I still want to know more. I have been trying to fight my depression for long and I still do but my head does not leave me alone. I feel like the only person that understands me or tries is my therapist other than that I feel alone also I was listening to Emma chamberlains podcast on spirituality and I felt like there is people out there like me. Why am I like this. I am so hard on myself I am scared to not achieve what I believe is my purpose I am scared to let myself down. Empty? Crowded? Idk,Depression
18427,Felt that way since middle and high school classmates started seeing my early stages of depression as seeking attention while being rejected by crushes often and bullied since fourth grade and abused by my dad and neglected by my mom because she is powerless to stop the abuse because she is a victim herself. With that being said fast forward to today.Now I am in 25K of credit card debt living in regret. Suicidally depressed and still getting rejected online and dealing with friends who are in relationships and make no effort to spend time with me when I need it when I break down mentally. Dealing with an abusive older brother and relatives who are oblivious to the abuse and do not know about my debt and severity of my depression not that they would care.I feel like i cannot trust nobody. I have nobody to talk to when I am lonely. Nobody fucking wants me nobody cares about me because otherwise i would not feel lonely and the need to make these posts that nobody will read on this cruel fucking website full of toxic assholes who do not even care about anything that is not riddled with upvotes. Working jobs that do not make enough to cover daily expenses and even constant family drama involving me my depression diabetes and my lack of exercise due to excess sleep due to a culmination of the three illnesses making me want to sleep and never wake up.I want sweet release i want to escape and since it is so fucking easy for everyone else to get into a relationship and get married and shit. Fucking hell even abusive and neglectful women I have met who treated me like shit get away with it and go on to live happy lives. So fuck it. I am not going to care anymore. Everyone always seems to lie to me about how everything is going to be okay while I am here still suffering even after taking Lexapro on the daily making me impotent and doing nothing to help with my sleep deprivation. This world sucks and something has to be done about it.I hate living here and i wish I never should have been born. Because then i would not be abused neglected touch starved emotionally drained and lacking basic human needs like love. People say everyone deserves love right? SO WHY IS IT SO FUCKING HARD TO GET IT? PEOPLE ARE JUST CRUEL. that is why I will never care or empathize again because if life taught me anything it is that cruelty and apathy pays the big bucks in this depraved world. Depression taught me i cannot trust people anymore,Depression

10394,Really. I always thought this to an extent. But now the one friend I was closest to for years and I supported for years just let us me rot and could not care less how I am feeling or if I died. I am sure this friend will cry and play victim when I die. I never saw this coming and this just confirms that most people are shit. I am still in shock and I am full of hate for this person now. I know that is not serving me anything good but the last 3 years have been so fucking SHIT and I have met so many people who have fucked me over and showed me they do not care about me when I thought they did and when I did care about them. I am so done.Maybe it is fucking cheesy and pathetic but these lyrics speak so much to me nowDo I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness? Fuck people,Depression
38252,legitimate question i m not trying to be close minded or anything i got referred to a therapy clinic by a friend of mine and i have been doing weekly session for a month now i don t feel any better and to be honest i kind of dread my therapy session because they leave me feeling even more helpless and empty i think my therapist isn t the best phd student in training but i feel so bad saying that since i know she s there to help me people have told me to change therapist but jesus christ i can t bring myself to do it because i feel bad i put myself in her shoe i honestly don t know if i m being impatient about all this since i ve heard therapy take many session to help at all anyways i went to therapy because i wa fed up with life after dealing with anxiety and depression symptom for year and i wanted to take my friend s advice also my depression symptom have been worse even though my qol ha been better overall i let my therapist know that nothing triggered my depressive episode this time around and that my mind is just painfully empty feel like someone is constricting my brain and i feel lethargic all the time but all she doe is ask what do you mean by that sorry if i m writing too much in one post but i heard therapist aren t supposed to give advice so what exactly can she do for me she doe cbt sometimes like when i told her that everyone in the room judge me for the way i walk and talk to which she say who told you that are you sure you re not judging them first which doe make my question myself slightly but that s all nothing that i can actively implement to help me counter those thought but then again i have no idea what i m supposed to take from my session and would appreciate your guy feedback any experience you want to share amp x 00b edit sorry wanted to clear up that i haven t been formally diagnosed with anything so i m not 00 sure if i had a depressive episode i had to ask my therapist to refer me to a psychiatrist didn t seem like she wa going to since i wanted a proper assesment,Depression
19174,i have severe depression that has been diagnosed but my mom refuses to treat it and says I am faking that its all in my head. my mother is a narcissist and is convinced the internet planted these ideas in my head even though i have previous childhood trauma and adhd. she is just convinced that I am fine but I am far from it. i have a pet allergy and have prescribed medication that makes me extremely drowsy and take benadryl as needed but have access to it regardless. its been months since I have started taking it daily twice a day sometimes three times its become a ritual. my mom just yells at me for being constantly asleep and lazy but she does not even know that I am abusing my medication like i do. i cannot even stand being awake anymore i cannot stand being myself. its like i cannot stand waking up i cannot stand living anymore and when I am asleep its like my only escape. when i fall asleep its my only chance to not be me. nothing is fun. nothing is worth it. i just want to sleep. i cannot stand being awake anymore,Depression

23587,Why do I even try anymore? All you all ever do is wear me out use me disappoint me and then leave me.Why? What sick pleasure to you all get from it? Do you enjoy watching me suffer? Do you enjoy making me suffer?These past 23 days I have been more miserable than in my 8 years worth of depression. Before that I was the happiest for about over a month at least.At this point it has to be my fault. Everything always is. I have always been the easy scapegoat for anything. Nobody cares I am just a carpet for everyone to walk on when they need to clean their shoes.I have been hurting for years and no one even remotely bat an eye. Everyone is fake. Fake care. Fake attention. Fake friendships. Fake family bonds. Fake work dynamics. Fake love. Fake kindness. Fake fun. All you all do is take and never care about me. I am just a tool.Once I stop being useful once being myself overshadows the benefits I can bring you just leave me for dead.I have no one in this life. Not one soul. I will see you all in the burning abysses that I will oversee.I do not know when I am going to end it hell I have not thought about ending it for the past few months but today...Just know that my previous 25yo ETA is probably further away than the current ETA.You can all go die. Why do I even try?,Depression

19838,My husband told me a few months ago that he is depressed. I have noticed his overall mood treatment towards me not abusive just can be very short and does not really want to talk or do anything with me and treatment of himself had been going down not working out not showering not eating well etc but did not think it was really bad. After a few months of me being supportive and trying to help in any way I can think of he finally said he needs to see a doctor. I was excited about that he made no effort to make an appointment and has no general doctor. So I found him one and made him the appointment which he went to with no upset and actually for a few days he seemed happy about going and being put on some meds. Hes never been a good eater and ever since the depression hit he is been worse. I have noticed he is probably lost 20 lbs at least he was super thin to begin with. He used to be super active as well and now he will not even go on a walk.Last night at around 3am I woke up to an incredibly large thud outside our bedroom door. He works late or stays up late every night and I normally go to bed at a normal hour. I rushed out of the bedroom to him crumbled on the floor passed out. He actually damaged the wall some with going down and now has a gash in his shoulder. He came to pretty fast but was overall super pale shaking nauseous etc. He would not let me take him to the hospital or is not letting me call his doctor today. I am not sure what caused this but I started tallying his calorie intake and he is getting around 1000 calories a day at most and when he does eat it is normally complete shit soda chips and cookies fast food etc. he is over 6 foot and in his mid 30s. He now has high blood pressure and high cholesterol along with other health issues. I am now super worried and he still has not eaten since he passed out. I just would like some help on what to do now as now I am almost worrying of I am dealing with some sort of male anorexia and not just depression. I wrote him something last night telling him that not even eating a child's portion of food everyday nor taking regular showers is unacceptable. I do not know if something like this is ok for someone with depression or whatever is going on though. Just asking for tips to help my husband,Depression
48176,that not so funny feeling im reminded of my depression again with a heavy and hollow feeling in my chest. its like someone is sitting on me pinning me down rendering me unable to do anything other than lay in bed. i feel this much stronger when i have to be alone with my thoughts. or if im tired. these days i find that im always tired.,Depression

I am developing a storytelling and mental health platform with the ultimate aim of curating a museum exhibition. Soul relics Museum is a platform for people to read and tell stories of mental health through objects that help them connect or express to a present or past experience they have had with their mental health. Its a unique and creative idea to help people come forward and share with others what mental health problems have been like for them and a safe and constructive way to read of others experiences while being brave enough to share your own. Together we can create a collective voice in raising awareness and education on mental health!,Normal

We hope to learn if and how preferences for treatment change over time and if patients perception of their treatments match to their preferences is related to the benefit received from treatment. The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate you will be asked to provide some demographicbackground information respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time and about your quality of life.

At my lowest points I was taking 200 mg a day but I have been stable on 150 mg a day for a while now. I would like to one day be off of it completely but I know that will take a lot of time and work. My question is can anyone tell me their experiences with withdrawal symptoms?,Normal

29378,I've heard it's less activating and more calming than Zoloft as it's the most serotonin selective. I've also heard Trazodone may be an option for someone who wants SSRIlikeeffects without any activation. Additionally my Psych doctor mentioned Gabapentin as a way to directly target anxiety without any of the longterm concerns of daily benzo use. though I've read it's not without its own drawbacks. Obviously this wouldn't have any serotonergic effect but could be a good alternative to the Xanax.,Normal
27558,I'm pretty broke and almost all of my money for now is going towards bills and food. I have my state's basic free insurance OHP Oregon Health Plan but I'm not sure what kind of psychological services they could provide.

At the time I didnt understand trauma or realize how deep her problems were since I hadnt seen them much but I always listened to her first and foremost. We paid out of pocket for a home birth with a backup hospital plan at her parents house. The birth was precipitous very fast only a few hours and extremely traumatic and painful. No pain medication and I think the speed of the birth makes it more traumatic and our son had his hand over his head when he came out.,Normal

She and I have really hit it off and have begun to care quite a bit for one another. For obvious reasons she is really afraid to get involved with me beyond casual dating and weve taken a break for a while to let her sort out some of her emotional issues. We hope to reconnect after a while when shes in a better place emotionally and some of the logistics between us are better. Ive tried to be as supportive and encouraging as possible to her but I have never been in this situation before so oftentimes I am not sure what to do or say.,Normal

My sister was younger than me and doesn't have quite as much baggage from it all I don't think she remembers as much or maybe she blocked more of it out another small mercy but she still has deep issues and acts out in really inappropriate ways.

This doesn't particularly bother me because I figured he's just sleeping and all the individual apartments have locks on the doors anyway.

51467,All I am is a useless burden I volunteer at a place that I like to help out at despite my debilitating anxiety because I like helping people plus Itll help me gain credit for my future job but for a few days I didnt show up due to sickness. Now im supposed to text them when I dont show up my manager? boss? made that very clear. She even gave me her personal email to text because she understood that I absolutely couldnt take phone calls due to anxiety. Now I may or may not have just skipped that part as Id hate to bother them with a text plus its embarrassing. So basically my school counselor who is in contact with my manager comes up to me and tells me that my manager was very upset and direct that I cant keep not notifying them when I cant go and I have one last chance or shed rather have me not help out at all. This of course I soooo badly wanna say traumatized because it feels that way but ive experienced trauma before to know that this experience wasnt actually traumatic really hurt me. All I wanted to do was help. I just wanted to be useful to someone for once and all I did was end up being a burden. I hate myself for this im scared to even go in again. If I cant even hold a volenteer position im sure as hell arent ever going to be able to get a real job when I get older. I fucking hate this disease its taking my life away.,Personality-disorder

50987,I feel out of place no matter how much I try I recently signed up for uni and the first two weeks have been okay if only I'm only slightly disappointed for not doing more to talk to other people and befriend them.I still managed to befriend two or three people. I try my best to talk to them but even just greeting them makes me feel anxious because what if they didn't want to greet me or they didn't want to talk to me or they're talking with someone else clearly closer to them than me or at least more interesting. So I end up feeling out of place because I can't gather the courage to talk more while they all befriend each other.Despite all of these feelings I kept pushing through and this last weekend I managed to ask one of my classmates friends who I considered myself to be the closest to to hang out and they accepted. It went well we talked a lot and in the moment it felt like we were having fun. But when I came back home all of these awful feelings that maybe they were uncomfortable and didn't really want to hang out with me or talk to me and they were just being polite and nice or maybe they were just trying to see how it would be like to hangout with me realizing I'm more of a nuisance and a bore than it's worth to keep around started consuming my mind.I tried to push these thoughts in the back of my mind as much as I could but today I already went to class with all of these thoughts filling my mind. I saw my friend ? enter class but I couldn't bring myself to talk to them. Not even a single greeting nothing and I felt like a piece of shit for not trying more because surely they thought I was rude for not saying anything. They were talking normally to other people during break time and I envied all of them. I wish I could talk so easily with other people befriending them. I wish I wouldn't be scared of saying anything in fears of being ignored. So I ended up feeling out of place again despite my desires to fit in.I thought maybe at least we'd have the chance to talk after class. No. All I could manage to mutter was a halfcut word before they said goodbye even if smiling and walked up to someone else to talk to them. My logic says everything is okay and today they were simply on a rush after class but my AvPD says they absolutely hate me and don't want to do anything with me anymore.I feel like I messed up big time and that I lost a potential friend. I feel like I lost all my chances of having friends ever again even. And I know it's my fault because I should have talked more but when I talk more I'm scared to scare them all away. I hate how hard it is to simply say 'hello' and ask someone how they're doing. I feel like I'll be seen as a weirdo and ignored even if the person is a friend.So I don't know what to do.Sorry for the long rant. Sorry if I used the wrong flair too I don't normally post anywhere. I just really needed to vent.,Personality-disorder

My mind is stopping me of being able to enjoy simple things in life and I don't want it anymore.College is starting soon and I'm more mature and I want to fit in. I don't think I'll be able to enjoy any potential friendships I can make if I don't change how I think,Personality-disorder
50767,must bargain with the universe for social plans so my 18ftm coworker evilyn 19f was going to see a band at a music venue an hour away she posted to her instagram story about needing a ride i offered to take her because i want to get out of the house. she said she'd be down and now i'm just waiting for her to respond so we can plan stuff on SC. she mentioned having extra tickets but i'm still buying my own because she didn't directly offer it to me and i don't want to embarrass myself in case it's not implied. they're like 15 each so it's not outlandish or anything. and i'm too afraid to ask to clarify like so if i'm going too would you give me one of your extra tickets? it's not unreasonable i know if i were her i wouldn't mind the question but i'd feel like a terrible person for asking even if we were closer. also not going to clarify that this is 100 platonic because we're coworkers and i think she knows i'm gay the one thing i miss about presenting female is that i never had to make those distinctions with other girls. but will live in fear of that misunderstanding nonetheless. another fear evilyn is on pretty friendly terms with jonah 20M our other coworker a the one and only person ive ever romantically pursued lots to unpack with that but for brevity's sake let's not. as in they've hung out outside of work more than once. now i don't think jonah is the petty type but if evilyn mentions it to him i wouldn't put it past him to say something idk what but not sure he likes me much at the moment that would make her back out. and if that were the case she'd just make an excuse so i would never really know. rambling post but i wanted to talk about my fears somewhere. this is the closest i will get to feeling hyped about hanging out with someone. mainly in my own head i have to earn outings by going over everything that could go wrong and by being of use ie giving her a ride without expecting a free ticket. yeeeah it's a lot. thanks for reading all ,Personality-disorder
50566,Respond to my text immediately or I'll think I said something wrong I never let the ppl I talk to know this. That would just be manipulative and rude but even if we been texting for years good friends and have been in a nonstop convo the past 5 hours my heart still races when they take longer than usual to respond. I think oh fuck I said something wrong. I always say something wrong. I can't ever say anything right. I'm such aThen they'll reply. I chide myself for being so silly. Then do the same thing 40 more times within the same conversation. You'd think being proven wrong so many times would fix it but no. I always think Ah this is the time I fucked up.

51253,I made my feelings known despite knowing I wasn't going to get the results I wanted. I told someone how I truly felt about them.

I walked away from the conversation in no more pain than I was in when I started it. I can at least live knowing that I didn't let my anxiety keep my from taking the chance. I don't think anything will change between us as a result of the conversation which is good as they are a good friend of mine and I would hate to lose that.Life has been weird lately I have discussed my feelings about this person with someone else which is something I wouldn't have ever thought I could do. I think that has helped me gather the strength to talk to the other person directly. Whatever works right?,Personality-disorder

It feels like everything is constantly rejecting me by putting barriers everywhere and Im already fucking exhausted from having to be alive. I just feel so dejected about doing literally anything for money. Its been my most difficult barrier and all I want is someone to be gentle with me so I can trust them and give working a shot.

51273,My first day at the job It was awful I hated it and I am so afraid of going in there again.. I don't want to go much into details but the whole day I kept forgetting every fucking thing I was told. I kept zoning out asking a lot of questions a lot of times the same kind of questions again and again being slow because how much I was overwhelmed. I kept telling myself that I am giving it my best it's my first day and no one should expect me being immediately perfect in this but it didn't really help. I needed to do a lot of multitasking to keep my eye on multiple things but it seemed that I just couldn't focus. In the end I felt extremely inferior to all my coworkers. Whenever some of them would remind me that I was forgetting somethingdoing something wrongetc I felt so attacked crushed judged...At some point I even nearly cried but I could suppress it. God I hate this shit. I am aware that 99 of those thoughts I have are completely inadequate and irrational I am certain that they were just trying to help and guide me since I am new in there. But why doesn't it help with feeling less worthless..,Personality-disorder

50556,My future feels so hopeless. I'm 28 years old my resume is useless haven't worked in 2 years and I am very avoidant of the world Hi there. I have been depressed since I was 12 years old. I am now 28. I also struggle with BPD social anxiety and Avoidant Personality Disorder afraid to leave the house by myself reliant on my 66 year old mother to pay my medical insurance and my husband is working full time barely keeping us afloat. I have tried and tried to work. Several different fields. Even part time. It always ended up in burn out and felt more depressed and anxious so I had to quit. I am worried I feel my future is really hopeless. I love my husband so much. We wanted to have a family and it's feeling like that won't happen because of my mental health and the low money thing. I am afraid he will abandon me because of all this though deep down really don't feel like he will because he has been here through everything.I know that is so much. That is definitely something to be grateful for. But we fight a good bit because we're both so stressed out.Nothing really brings me happiness except substances and that leads to bad feelings when it wears off or sometimes when on them and I've been mostly sober for a year.I see a therapist. I take medications. I just... I am not content in life. I am constantly worried about everything. I constantly feel like I'm worthless and my husband deserves someone more stable that he doesn't essentially have to be a caregiver to at times. I stay in bed about 70 of my days because I feel like things are so hard to do and feel so pointless.I don't have many friends and live in a small town so there aren't any meetup groups or anything. And since I don't work and am not in school no opportunities to make many friends. I do have one so I can try to branch out with her friends maybe. It feels like life is just about working. And I feel so depressed by the state of everything and by my worries that things won't improve in the future.Things don't get better. Not if you don't work for them. And I have worked I've tried so many treatments but the one thing I rarely do is go out in the world.And I don't know if I can do that without a lot of help that I don't know if I can find.Please if you can relate at all or have any advice please please respond. lt3 I'm desperate.,Personality-disorder
51466,This is a bit of a weird question but does anyone else relate a lot to these anime titles? Mushishi Kino's Journey etc I've always wondered if this is something AvPD adjacent. Mushishi Kino's Journey Spice and wolf Girl's last tour Serial Experiments LainThey are not really related in any genre way but all feature some sort of disconnect with the MCs and the rest of the world. It's like you're just traveling through it and never really putting down roots but instead just observing for a while and then moving on they all sort of have this somber undertone that you're not really a part of the world and just experiencing small parts of it. Most of them feature a pair traveling together which makes it feel less lonely but Mushishi only has the MC and that's the one that feels closest to AvPD in a weird way in my mind.Does this make sense?,Personality-disorder
50695,What I see on Instagram IS real and it's killing me inside A selfpitying post for your viewing pleasure Stop self harming by stalking people yada yada yada I know!!!! I know I know better!BUT.I'm sick of being told they only show the happy moments. No shit. But they have happy moments. They have adventures with friends that they post every other week or even just every month and some of them even post every week or more. I'm in my early 20s and so many people I went to high school with are traveling the world before they're tied down with more responsibilities and their bodies fall apart mine already is.... Not because they're rich but because they're simply financially comfortable and have connections with people social skills. And because they're not afraid to take risks. And because they've built a life for themselves an identity since early on in high school maybe even earlier which makes doing all of this feel normal to them makes it all so much easier for them.And if they're not traveling they're still going on smaller adventures with friends and gfsbfs. Or they're performing in a band at local venues and they're actually good now. Or they're about to graduate college. Envy kills me.I'm so fucked up I took a gap year to figure out what I want to do with my life only to drop out of an overpriced community college this year because I still feel too directionless.And I know I could have at least a small chance at what these people have if only I would get off my ass instead of sulking. I actually just checked more like stalked because I'm not following any of these people Instagram for the first time in months. Hurt even more than it did the last time. And in those months where I stopped looking at their lives did mine improve? Did pretending they aren't living happy fulfilling lives by avoiding their social media posts altogether make my life any better? Contrary to what every mentalhealthgurugenius on Reddit claims no it didn't make my life any better. I'm still stuck. I try my hardest every day and I'm still stuck.Sure. I've finally had a job at this point in my life retail but I snapped and quit. I can drive now though I hate it. I can go by the mall by myself and do some shopping not that I have money to spend. And yet it's nothing. It means nothing because it's not enough. Not enough for society and not enough to make me feel fulfilled because it means nothing without other people.,Personality-disorder
51494,Out with friends for the first time in a long time.. cant leave.. Went out with an old friend for her birthday in a city two hours away from where I live. Things were going well but Im getting the feeling I annoyed everyone and no one wants to hear my voice anymore. I cant excuse myself and go home and I also feel rude saying Im going to bed first. Im the only single person here and theres so many years of bonding and inside jokes Ive missed out on. You know when at the beginning of the night everyone seems happy to see you and laughs at your comments if youre your lucky but then everyone slowly stops replying to you and distancing themselves from you as the night goes on. I also got overstimulated and frustrated very briefly not at anyone in particular but now I just feel like I overstayer my welcome. Im stuck here until tomorrow morning when we go home and I have no one to talk to because this girl I came with is my only friend. I feel like shrinking and making everyone forget I was ever here.,Personality-disorder
51518,i'm never gonna be loved by anyone... and i think that's okay. for a long time all i wanted is to be loved by other people but as a depressed individual it's been kinda impossible to believe anyone will ever love me. and i don't even mean it exclusively in the romantic sense how does a first kiss feel? i don't even know but in the platonic sense too.i don't even think i'm physically unattractive but i do know my personality is unattractive which is somehow worse. with this i am not saying i am unworthy of love i mean that my goals in life and my way of being is not what it's expected of people nowadays. i have weird and extremely niche interests i am weird and my only purpose in life is to collect the biggest spectrum of unique experiencies definitely not the kind of people that attracts other people in this world i mean ambitious people with dreams of financial gains charismatic people etcetera.don't get me wrong i love my weird quirky self but so far nobody has ever loved my weird quirky self lol. i know there's lots of people in this big and wide planet but it seems like i don't have the skills to find the people who will like me the people who will form groups with me the people who will desire me in a romantic way. and considering my age i feel like it's too late to find those skills the skills of making deep meaningful reciprocal connections with other people.but i think that's okay. somehow getting rid of the desire to form connections with others has made me happier with those smalltalk friendships whom only talk to me about the weather or their job with those classmates who only talk to me when i awkwardly join the bigger groups at college. maybe thinking that i'm worthy to be loved by other people is me asking too much?the approach i'm taking now is to love myself. and with love i mean romantic love i flirt with myself. i tell myself i'm beautiful even if i don't recognize that person in the mirror as someone beautiful. i have lots of love buried in my heart and i always waited to get into a relationship to give this love to someone else. now i try to give it to my own self. there's days when i really want to die and i can't even get out of bed and i ask myself what would i do if the love of my life felt like this? and i realize that i would support her i would do everything to get her out of bed help her bath and make some food for her. so i get out of bed i bathe myself and make myself some food.there's some days when loneliness hurts though. i always see stories of the beauty of romantic love of touching the lips of the person you would die for feeling that person's chest and not caring if the world ends as long as you're on their arms. stories of the joy of hanging out with likeminded people and just being up at 4am enjoying each other's presence and looking at the stars together. these are experiences i will never live and it hurts. and it makes me feel like this whole philosophy i just described in this post is just a dangerous coping mechanism.but what would i do if the love of my life felt like this? i would hug them and tell them that it's gonna be okay. so i just tell myself that i'm gonna be okay.You think you might find community a sense of connection to something bigger but you dont. In fact you feel more alone than you did before you left But you survive. You learn that you can survive being alone. Bojack Horseman,Personality-disorder
50777,Feeling like an empty body with nothing inside. Im a 24 year old female and I never developed my own personality. I also suspect I have autism because I did a lot of research and I just know my brain is wired differently. I cant hold friendships and I hurt them because I keep them on a distance. They cant help me and see mee struggling and getting in abusive relationships because my self esteem is so low. Because of this I have a lot of traumas. When I was a kid I was neglected by my parents because they were addicts. I lived in a psychiatrical hospital for a long time cause I tried to commit suicide. It wasnt a serious attempt. I just didnt know how to get out of the situation. Anyway Im 24 now and Ive learned a lot so far. Between my 1822 I did a lot of drugs and I felt normal. I felt like people wanted to be friends with me because I was social and talkative and not scared at all. But deep down I knew it was fake. The friendships I build were fake. I tried for so many years to adapt myself to others just to fit in. And next to that I was in an abusive relationship. I was paranoid and stressed. Always scared theyd find out the real me. And I did this for so long I dont even remember who I am right now. I am depressed diagnosed with ptsd AvPD and traits of borderline disorder. I asked for a psychological diagnosis for autism but they didnt think I have enough traits to fit the criteria. I dont really care about labels but I feel like there is something really wrong with me. Im an alien in this world. It feels so alone.Sorry for the long text. Im prone to addiction and Im addicted to Xanax right now. I get admitted to a rehab clinic this Friday for 21 nights and then straight after that to Portugal for intense therapy. Im glad to have this opportunity and Ill definitely get out of my comfort zone. I know they wont fix my problems but itll hopefully give me the push I need to work hard. Cause I do believe I can find out who I am and make real friends without being fake. I have hope and I want you to have it tooWere all different with different stories but the one thing that is so important getting out of your comfort zone. Do things that are scary. Take baby steps. Dont set the bar too high for yourself. Everyone is different so you cant compare yourself to others.Good luck everyone and just keep swimming,Personality-disorder

Like I dont really care if they think Im dumb or even like me at this point in my life but something about knowing people see me is terrifying. Eye contact is the absolute worst because its 100 percent focus. I always try to look people in the eyes but HAVE to look away within a second otherwise I feel like theyll hate me. Im 24M and its waaaay worse with women I feel like Im invading their space just looking anywhere near them to the point I dont even know what their face looks like after an interaction.When my best friend of 10 years comes over to watch a movie I will not glance in their direction the entire time and stay on my side of the couch. But I can converse just fine and not overthink my words at all. I also feel like I have tunnel vision when im in grocery stores and if I go to a restaurant I will be stiffly hunched over my plate staring at the wall the entire time. I just realized being blind would be kinda awesome and probably take away like 90 percent of my stressors. Okay this got way out of hand im baked goodnight and if youre reading this I love you,Personality-disorder

51393,Its like I live in different world In country where I live there were president elections and I didnt even know about it until I went to someone I know and they asked me who I think will win president elections. It was already day after voting and they were just counting votes. I acted like I knew about it but I didnt.Like I dont watch news or anything so I am out of loop in lots of things that are happening and I dont care much about politics honestly.I also cant vote in this country because I am a foreigner here so thats another thing why I dont care about it much. But fk the thing that president elections just slipped through without me even knowing about them I found this to be ridiculous. Because it is always such a big event how could I miss this?I also missed USA president elections I am not USA citizen I live in Europe. I learned that Biden is president 1.5 year later sometime in 2022 summer after he was elected. I still thought that Trump was president lol.I realized that I withdrawn from life too much but it wasnt even my choice. It was also because of COVID and that government forced us to just stay at home. I isolated myself from other people for almost 2 years and now I am trying to go out again and trying to put my life back together.,Personality-disorder
51532,Im worried Im second choice I met a guy on a trip two years ago. He told mutual friends that he liked me and he asked them not to tell me but they did. When he found out that I knew he cut off all contact with me. Two months later he and his girlfriend broke up. I have to admit that before he was single I'd look at his TikToks a lot. I never liked or commented on it I'd just watch the videos.A few days before he and his girlfriend broke up I noticed that my TikToks would go up. I had 3 followers but whenever I'd watch his videos a few hours later my TikTok views would rise. I even tried doing it on certain days eg. I'd watch his videos one day watch it two days later then the day after and each time I saw them my views went up and on the days that I didn't watch them they stayed the same. This continued for the better part of a year. Last year it was still frequent but less so. Now it's every two or three weeks that we do this. One time he even posted a TikTok in English English isn't his first language and all of his previous videos were in his native language.TikTok wasn't the only platform he was looking at me on. He would do it on Twitter too. One time I retweeted a picture of a Star Wars character. Less than an hour later he posted a meme of that same character. The meme was in English and it's not that I want to say that the meme wasn't funny but it was obvious that he posted it just to post it. There's been at least three other instances where he did something similar.However twice he did things that tickled me funny. About six months after they broke up he started following her on TikTok but unfollowed her within a few hours probably because she didnt follow him back. A month later one of his ex's close friends posted a TikTok video with his ex in it. He started following this friend. Around eight months of this going on he made his Instagram and TikTok private. I have no idea why. But I can tell he still looks at my TikTok because TikTok tells who looks at your profile. I dont post much and he looks at it every two to three days.,Personality-disorder

Since I have to talk to my classmates its hard not to become acquaintances with some of them. But now I feel like Im in too deep and need to retreat. I want to shut everyone out to protect myself. I know its stupid because they arent mean to me or make me feel bad its just in my head. My mind tells me that they dont really care for methey just have to talk to me. What is that?

I feel so stupid. I ended up asking him if he would walk me through his moves while we play chess so I can have clear examples of how to apply different strategies. It was maybe the most ashamedpathetic I have ever felt. I feel a bit better now but fuck I just want to be able to have fun with him.

A few months since I graduated high school Ive been working. But I cant seem to really talk to people. I have a tendency to avoid the groups sometimes I cant even open my mouth. Its even worse when I think about how much I suck and how awful I look. I feel like an inconvenience and a burden because plainly I am pretty stupid. Even though at the beginning of my job I was putting on a smile and a happy voice to convince myself it was okay I cant even get myself to smile or look people in the eyes unless I have to.

50995,Update to 'Oh god I have a date' My old posthttpswww.reddit.comrAvPDcommentszwc806ohgodihaveadateHi everyone!Since you all were so kind I wanted to share my experience. The date went okay but she kind of felt distant to me afterwards shorter answers not really engaging in text chats. It felt like she had no interest so I stopped texting her. Last Wednesday after a dance class some people went to a bar in the same building. I chatted with her and some other people. It was quite nice. Afterwards we had the same way home so we walked together and kept talking. She talked about some mental health problems she had and how she was dealing with it therapy and so on. She was quite open and frank. Later when I was at home I thought about how she was in person compared to the text messages. My picture of her had changed a bit. Previously I would have said she was quite the confident woman I still think she is though but afterwards I saw that she also had internal struggles and insecurities. So I today decided to ask her again if she'd like to meet for a coffee. She texted me back that she thinks I'm really sweet and it's always fun talking with me but her life is too full right now and she has no place right now for another friendship or something deeper. She'd like to keep it at the dance lessons and socials. She is sorry that's probably not the answer I was hoping for but she is just trying to being honest. I wrote back that it wasn't the answer I hoped for but I thought I would get. I thought she was a great person and find her to be pretty awesome so I had to write her. So that's it. I'm a bit sad now although I knew this would be coming. Still it's better to be in the clear. I've given up some hope to find a partner. It's so hard not to be frustrated or be frustrated live through the frustration and get out of it on top. My few relationships began during those very rare moments in my life where I was truly happy. A condition that feels unreachable at the moment. This makes it feel impossible to find love. I try to be the best person I can be but it never feels enough.,Personality-disorder
51420,I think I have AvPD avoidant personality disorder I have recently come across AvPD and I realized that I relate to almost all of the symptoms. First off Im very anxious in almost all social situations. This includes hanging around friends ive known for many many years being around extended family who ive also known for many years being around coworkers meeting new people and even just going grocery shopping. I often try to avoid a lot of social situations which has definitely affected a lot of my relationships. Im not very close with my friends or family anymore. I still hangout with them sometimes but its not on a very deep level. I dont really open myself up to anyone. Im scared of people figuring out my true personality and that they wont like me for who I am. I hide lots of parts of my personality and not one person on this earth truly knows me. Im close enough with my parents that I dont get anxious around them however I still hide many pieces of myself and dont feel comfortable enough to show everything about myself. I have also struggled to find jobs that dont make me anxious. It took me until I was 18 years old until I finally got my first job because of this. I currently work at a daycare and have worked here for about 7 months and my anxiety has seemed to get worse. I have been thinking about quitting for awhile now but am terrified of having the conversation with my boss about quitting. Whenever Im at work I feel inferior to everyone else. I feel like I have less experience I overthink everything and I am so awkward around my coworkers and parents. I feel like Im incompetent and people dont take me seriously because of my poor communication skills. My mind often goes blank when Im asked questions and I dont feel like Im much of a help. I also try to focus completely on the kids and I would rather not form any real relationships with other coworkers. I try to keep conversations polite and small. I rarely talk about myself either just enough to get by. I play it safe. Ive always just felt like there was something wrong with me. Social anxiety kinda describes the way I feel but it seems like its more than just that.,Personality-disorder

50894,Pet Peeve When people think I owe them conversation triggers my AvPD bad. Does anyone else get annoyed when either family or strangers get an attitude with you if you don't entertain their conversation? I can be civil and nice IRL. I'm not walking around telling people eff you eff this eff that. However the WORST ones are the people that think they are giving me golden advice like hey don't do drugs but they have never known me to do such things. It's painting me in a bad light for me to agree with the advice willy nilly. But the kicker is they get upset if I escalate and say I don't do drugs to begin with? Do I look like a crack head to them? They take it as me being immature and unable to take advice. So I am supposed to sit here and entertain disrespectful conversation with people giving me advice on not to be irresponsible and that's what makes someone mature? This has happened with strangers too where they think they can talk to me about avoiding marriage cause theirs suck or dating because of their own griefs. Whether I get married or whatever I do is not their business. I usually only get approached with stupid conversations like that by family. They get big mad when I shut it down. The only carrot they dangle over my head is money. I straight up rather be homeless than listen to me being accused of driving recklessly or my mom threatening about my insurance rates going up.

Sometimes I will want to reply or add something to it but I worry it will prolong the conversation and make it harder to finish it.

50949,Social anxietygeared remedies and treatments have made things worse Trigger warning for suicidal ideation mention.Also long post alert. This is something thats been brewing for a while that I hadnt been able to articulate until now.Im 24 years old. Ive been actively trying to combat social anxiety since I was 17. And after reflecting on these past years I truly feel like all of the things I did to try to improve have only made my feelings worse and solidified my fears. For example public speaking I was told throughout school and therapy that practicing public speaking would make it easier over time. I was also told I would need to do a lot of it to have a successful career. So I did the following joined the media club in high school where I made intercom announcements and once made a TV announcement. Taught Spanish to children as an assignment. Took opportunities to read aloud in class and chose speaking assignments when given the choice. In college I had several mandatory presentations. I joined clubs and did almost weekly public speaking for various purposes for them. I called numbers for a bingo game for over 100 people and also proctored a club election. I then became a resident advisor which involved pretty regular public speaking. Let me tell you it did NOT get easier yall lmao. I swear to god I kept telling myself it would get better and waiting for it to get easier and it only got harder emotionally. I definitely improved my skills but every public speaking incident wreaked absolute havoc on my psyche. Like throwing up beforehand staying up and ruminating after shaking emotional anguish insomnia the works. Like Id argue it got even worse as time went on. No amount of praise was ever able to shake it and ive received some pretty consistent positive feedback. I have this thought of like probability. Like I WILL fuck up and embarrass myself during an event. And every time a speech goes well I feel like my odds of failure increase. Plus Im not sure how much I trust the positive feedback Ive gotten. I can accept that Im an effective speaker but anything more than that feels fake like people are lying to make me feel better. So public speaking hasnt gotten easier. Im out of options. And its frustrating that no one around me understands this because to them Im a sufficient speaker. But the idea of speaking to a group of people makes me want to fucking kill myself. Like every time. And now I have a ton of lovely memories that play in my head when I think of speaking. Like my brain has the motherload of material to make me feel deep levels of shame embarrassment regret anxiety etc. I wish id never started doing this stuff because now people actually expect it of me and I am haunted by awful memories that make me feel worse than I did before. I mean for fucks sake Ill get in a panic because I remembered speaking to KIDS. Six year olds. Who the fuck is embarrassed to speak to six year olds? Remembering things like this can straightup ruin an otherwise perfect day and completely sour my mood. Its not just public speaking. Its making friends joining clubs volunteering working the works. I faced my fears and they fought back viciously. And after covid isolation I find it literally impossible to force myself to try these things again even though I know Im capable of them. I just dont want to contribute to the material my brain uses against me. I feel full like Im out of storage space. Im just sick of the regret and embarrassment and guilt over existing the way I did. I feel like Im destined to spend my future disappointing people and failing. Ill never be like I once was and even if I do then it will just be exhausting and miserable. Right before covid I was reaching a breaking point anywaylike I was about to quit my job or get fired and possibly school because I couldnt handle the hole Id dug myself into. I feel spent and directionless. I dont know what my goals are anymore. I dont even know who I am because I spent so long trying to be someone Im not.,Personality-disorder

51430,this disorder has stopped me from pushing myself for the better me. Was scrolling on tiktok when I saw my previous school mate 2 years younger than me on my FYP. She's a famous race car driver representing our country all over the world. She now just recently joined an F1 school. I know money and her being a nepo baby her father was also a race car driver before helped her achieve big things but she also wouldn't be where she is right now if she wasn't great. I just realized that I'm 2 years older than her and I'm about to repeat my last year of highschool i dropped out this mid school year because of mental health reasons and I still don't even know wtf I wanna do in life. My best friend is so fckin smart she's studying right now to be a chemical engineer. My other best friend is also smart all of his grade averages are 95 100 is the highest in my country. I'm surrounded by smart and talented people with a future people who will make a name for themselves and become rich in the future. People who have already carved their paths. While I'm here barely even making it through the day. I can't even go to school without wanting to off myself while they're here working their ass off for their future.My best friends don't even know I already dropped out of high school. I'm too embarrassed to tell them. How can I tell them? They would be too embarrassed to have a highschool dropout as a friend. What am i even doing with my life? I always avoid things things that make me feel uncomfy or unsafe. Now look where that got me. Stuck inside the house wasting my life away. I'm gonna be 20 in october my teen years are finally over. I didn't even get to experience the things that teenagers are supposed to experience. I can't believe smart people like my friends are friends with someone as pathetic as me.,Personality-disorder
50633,does anyone else keep making new Reddit accounts? I find myself abandoning Reddit accounts and making new ones every few weeks or so. I hate the fact that Reddit leaves a trail of evidence about me that I can't hide from people and make my comments and questions private. I hate the whole karma and upvotesdownvotes thing. I like Reddit for the simple fact that there are communities here for just about everything that I don't have access to otherwise. I also use Facebook groups but I have an account with a fake name and no information on the profile. If I have commented too much in a single group and people start recognizing me I usually change my name on Facebook. You are usually allowed to change your name on Facebook several times a year or so.I just hate the fact that I am seen and I have built a persona either online or offline. I just wish I could be invisible or anonymous everywhere I went including online. I also hate people knowing what country I was born in because most people are from the United states and it makes me stand out so I try and use American terms and spellings as much as I can. I also have trauma from my home country and just mentioning that I am from there makes me anxious and I feel paranoid talking to people from my own country. I go back and edit comments constantly and I'm always deleting things.People automatically find this behavior shifty and I have been called out a few times and people always think I'm up to something.,Personality-disorder

50623,AvPD and covid has ruined my dream job. So I've been a nanny for about 10 years now daycare before that and one of the best parts of the job was extremely minimal adult interaction. I'd go to work one of the parents would tell me what I needed to know and then went to work. When they got back in the evening we'd say goodnight and that was it. Since covid however at least one of the parents works from home. I currently work for a family with BOTH parents work from home. It's terrible. I jump at every noise that might mean they are coming to say hi to their kid. I worry so much about where they are what they think they're hearing when I talk to their baby my appearance the way I dress. I imagine they're mocking the way I sneeze or they're disgusted by my weight gain.I am very good at my job but my anxiety is so distracting it makes everything so much harder. I can't tell you how many times I've tossed my phone across the room when I hear footsteps coming because even if I am only looking up the weather or craft ideas I'm terrified they'll think I'm on the phone all day.,Personality-disorder
51222,Isolation 10 Years Lonely and want Love Hello this is my first time posting on here! Im 26 F and have never been in a relationship. I have no friends. When I was in high school I had one friend but we parted and went separate ways. So the past couple years all I have been doing is listening to music with headphones on playing games watching films and daydreaming about love. I sometimes go out for walks in nature. I wish I could do fun stuff with someone one day. I recently came across someone who Im interested in. Weve talked and they seem nice. We have similar interests but Im afraid of speaking up and telling them how I feel. It sucks having this because my negative self talk wins and I run away from people. Sigh this is hard! ,Personality-disorder
51509,I can't imagine what friendship would look like in my life I'm in my 40s now. The last time I had friends was in school. I'm not sure we would have been friends if the we hadn't been in the same environment day after day. Actually I'm pretty sure we wouldn't have been. My friends mostly were other people who didn't have other friends i.e. other outsiders. We'd meet to play computer games or sometimes rarely go swimming. But we never really talked about personal stuff. I'm not even sure this counts as friendship?Anyway...so I've been without that kind of social connection for a long time now. Too busy struggling with education and work and health and life in general to engage in hobbies. I think I really have no idea what friendship is apart from seeing it on TV or remembering childhood friends. Is it more than spending time together and watching TV or engaging in hobbies together? Am I even capable of friendship?Consequently friendship isn't something I've been looking for. Maybe if I knew what I'm missing out on I would?I'm about to embark on a psychotherapy journey again and I feel unprepared. What do I even want?,Personality-disorder

50870,I really miss having friends I think about old friends every single day always reminiscing about the good old days where I used to have people that liked me and I used to laugh a lot and make memories I've never since forgotten. I regularly fantasise about still hanging out with old friends I haven't spoken to in over a decade making up memories that never happened just trying to forget that are not part of my life anymore. The only times I've ever been truly happy was just being one of the guys where I was invited to things and people liked having me around for some reason I couldn't quite understand. And I just pushed everyone away assuming they all secretly hated me with absolutely evidence to support that claim. Then I spend the rest of my life thinking about them every day hoping some day they might still think of me and reach out cause I definitely am not the one to do it first. I haven't had a friend in years now and my life feels so empty without them they really do fill a massive gap in my life. Feeling wanted and liked by others is the best thing I've ever felt but it never lasts long before they see how really odd I am and a distance starts forming.Anyway sorry for the rant just having one of those days that even though it's exactly the same as every other day it also just feels worse for some unknown reason.,Personality-disorder

I always had the right word or description for what I intended to say. If only I wasnt an asshole and actually practiced conversation.. Not sure where it all started to escape me. Could be when my mental health went downhill or when I got off my meds or when I got high almost every day for a year. But nowadays its not uncommon for me to struggle to write simple sentences. Sending an email or text takes me way longer than it should.It really interferes when Im trying to talk with others.

Now I can barely look people in the eye and can't say hello or respond to small talk in work environments because it induces so much anxiety about being hated and misunderstood. I avoid textingresponding to messages because people used to say I was annoying and replied too much. If we're looking at the evidence everything points to me being a fundamentally unlikeable and hated person. I used to be fantastic at short bursts of social interactions but smoked cannabis non stop to be able to do so. People liked my stoneddrunk persona more than sober me and now that I'm sober I feel utterly terrified of interacting with anyone. I can't even answer the door for food deliveries. I need a job to be able to afford medical treatment but I always get stuck at the cover letter aspect because I feel like as soon as people get to know me they start to hate me. Most of my work experience has been in customer service or sales based roles but I hated every role I've ever done. I dedicated my academic years to studying medicine and law but had to drop out of uni to heal some trauma and I haven't returned since. I don't know what to do. I feel so alone and stuck and my rejection sensitivity is through the roof. I'm so ashamed of my failures and obvious shortcomings that it feels impossible to try to sell myself to a job.,Personality-disorder
51018,Ive decided to opt out of this disorder lol Im not an extrovert I dont want attention Im okay with being silent I hate small talk I want deep connections that come from a place of mutual patience and empathy and Im sorry to admit this so late but I wont find that with like 99 of people. It just is how it is. What Ill try to work onIll allow myself to fail stutter or mumble when I dont feel comfortable talking in groups but Ill talk nonetheless when I have something to say so that I can practice that which Im not good at.Which means Ill allow myself to feel discomfort. Deep discomfort and shame which I know will lessen one day or Ill get used to the feelings. Ill allow myself to be intimate with people I feel comfortable with. And to warn them when I feel like fleeing and hiding. The right people will understand and wont give up so easily. Ill accept failure expect disappointment and revel in misery because I know it will lead me to something better than this dark void Ive been living in the last years of my life. Thank you.,Personality-disorder
51485,Completely shut down when I know something uncomfortable is coming up I have a few university exams coming up that I'm not comfortable with taking and have no confidence of doing well in. I don't want to do them and the thought of preparing for them is absolutely exhausting partly because I feel like I have a lot to learn and even starting is hard. I just can't face it. So with that in mind I'm just avoiding my life and throwing myself into relentless scrolling on the likes of reddit and watching YouTube videos and basically becoming a robot. I'll probably cram in a load of information and ruin my sleep in the build up to the exam after wasting all this time.I don't know if it's a defence mechanism preparing for failure or what but it's fucking debilitating and I'm tired of it.,Personality-disorder
51364,Professor made eye contact and I had to throw up Two weeks before my calc prof came to tell me how disappointed he was in me for my poor grades and lack of turning in assignments. It had way too much of an impact. I literally couldn't show up to the next two classes.I finally get back and he's doing standard lecture stuff talking while scanning the large crowd so people feel more engaged. His eyes grazed mine a second. I know it meant nothing logically. It's just how people talk to crowds sweeping eyes. But in that moment I decided his gaze was a glare a disapproving irritated message straight to me. I felt like a failure terrible. I left the classroom quietly. Soon as I reached the hallway I ran. I ran to the bathroom to throw up.Just a second of eye contact and it destroyed me. I hate being like this lmao.,Personality-disorder
51264,Advice for AvPD college students? I'm a sophomore in college and I've totally given up on making friends. My issue isn't with finding a group to fit in with but rather just surviving my classes. All my courses this semester have a large amount of group and partner work and lately I've been skipping or running out of class to avoid it. Does anyone have any tips for getting through these interactions? I'm absolutely terrified of people my age due to unpleasant experiences in elementary and middle school.

51539,I love the idea of a romantic relationship but I cant put the work in. I 28M feel like any kind of datingrelationships is just work work work work work work. I like the idea of having a connection in my life but I dont think Im willing to do what it takes.I think bc Im so lowmaintenance I attract a lot of very clingy needy people which made me hate the idea of dating because theyd never leave me alone. And not just the process of dating itself which sucks for most people but just being in a relationship requires too much work and expectations. Maybe Im just lazy but how do you have the motivation to keep going with dating when its just annoyance?,Personality-disorder

50710,Is it okay to appear rude to others? I find it extremely anxiety inducing to be disliked and appearing rude or non caring elicits this reaction from others.The funny thing is I am continually day after day in my attempts not to appear this way am this way. I don't give solid eye contact to others mere glances I hide myself away in plain sight with poor meek body language I carry myself without confidence to avoid interactions.All in vain attempts of appearing in my delusional mind 'nice'. It is so self destructive you essentially let people walk over you ignore you in some desire to be liked. By people who dislike you will come to dislike you as a result of your behaviours or simply horrible people who you wouldn't want to like you. Let me give an example of what I'm thinking. You're shopping for groceries you want to look at a shelf which is currently occupied by someone else you need something on that shelf like a tin of food or something. Usually I will see this and think 'oh my god don't want them to know I need something there' heavens forbid if they see me what will they think? So I quickly change direction and pretend to look at other items until they move.So instead why not stand in their shadow and wait patiently let your presence be seen in an ideal world ask them to make space if you know exactly what you need but that would come when you're more confident? So yes stand next to them and don't budge just let them know non verbally you're waiting.Another example you're at the cashier they're doing your items I always look everywhere but where I need to look I lose focus on what I should be looking at which is the items I'm paying for the cashiers eyes in case they're trying to communicate something. And what if they say something small talk for instance well maybe I'm not in the mood to pursue further small talk so why not just give closed answers why do I feel the need to fill the silences to say whatever I can to appear 'normal'. I come across as flustered shy unconfident I see it in their faces they see the fear they see the disgust on my face believing I'm a wrongin or something but it's really just negativity brewing inside of me of being in such a anxiety inducing situation that causes these expressions on my face then they mirror it. And I think awful things about myself. So why not stay calmer speak slower not try and have a positive small talk experience just take things at my own pace. Otherwise I leave feeling utterly embarrassed ashamed and the next time I shop there and there my cashier they're going to hate that I'm there. As opposed to being more stoic and less nervously chatty.I'm rambling a bit losing focus on my words sorry but some of that probably doesn't make sense. I hope you get the type of rude I'm talking about. It's not purposefully being rude. It's more being true to yourself being comfortable in your own body and standing up to be counted as an equal. Something I avoid.Any ideas or experiences suggestions on these niche topic please?,Personality-disorder
51427,Anxiety after the gym Ever since I started going to the gym I have fallen in love with it. I look forward to it everyday as it completely distracts me from whatever it is I might be dealing with in my head. I usually go in the evening and up until then I'm fine. But I swear that drive back from the gym and when I'm sitting in my room all alone can be extremely excruciating sometimes. The anxiety feels like a balloon going up and up into the sky eventually it will pop and come back down. It's just an awful feeling and I feel it almost every time now. I wonder if anyone else has felt it or knows what I'm talking about? It's such a terribly lonely feeling I get. I think what really bothers me more than anything in my life is this belief I have that I am not a good person. I mean it's not like I'm cussing people out or being a dick to anyone. It's more like I treat people like they don't matter or mean anything to me it's an extremely shitty thing to do. Like I see a lot of the same people every day and I think normally this would result in you forming a bond with them slowly at least. But it's not like that everyone that's not in my immediate family just gets kept at arm's length. Even then the relationships I do have with my family almost seem to be held up by plastic and tape.,Personality-disorder

51057,Volunteering Heya first of all sorry for any ramblings or incorrect sentences my brain is all fuzzy and I'm shaking sadly.I've just sent off an email for a volunteering work it's a simple museum carer I will take care of the gardens the tourists and whatever needs available.I needed to do this to boost up my CV because I can't work because sadly..AVPD and CPTSDIt's all flexible hours I won't get into any trouble if I miss a few days or whatnot.But I am still. So. Fucking. Scared.This isn't anything O new situation fear no I've been to the museum once or twice and know the people I know the community. But I am so damn fucking scared of rejection. I am scared of the possible outcomes this will bring me. I am scared of the social aspects of it.I keep getting these thoughts of they'll think I'm a creep I'll probably never keep up with it because I am a pathetic good for nothing lower to everyone else.It's hurting me. And I need advice on how to just keep going what should I do once it starts? Fight through the thoughts and fears?It was already hard enough as it was to do the paper now I'm crashing wondering What the fuck was I thinking!? But I'm trying to keep positive as much as I possibly can. This could be a mix of social anxiety and AVPD running it's course but I don't know all I know is that I am scared and very fearful of the future of people of being seeing in public of messing up big time.Any words of encouragement or advice will help a lot. Thank you.,Personality-disorder

51442,Do you also feel this way? I just really came across with this term avoidant personality disorder on Google by searching why do I want to be alone and live on my own away from others and I clicked on the very first article that came up. I couldn't give much clearer description of myself after reading the article and so I looked it up on reddit and surprisingly a subreddit exists dedicated to this. I desire to be alone and living on my own away from my family and people because I feel inhibited by them. I feel like I'm restricted and couldn't act my true self when I'm with them maybe because I'm afraid of being disliked by them? I'm not really sure and I'm still learning and knowing about myself. Am I the only one who feels this way?,Personality-disorder
50897,Looking for some good vibes Hello everyone I am writing this because I've been reading posts on this sub for the past week since I've learned about AvPD from my new therapist and researching about this disorder as I believe I also suffer from it and have a curiosity from you people.Unfortunately not to make anyone feel bad about it as I know this condition is very hard to live with but I have been trying to look for some success stories from people here or maybe just some nuggets of hope from people that have managed to peacefully live this life.So my question for you especially maybe for the older people here with the conditionor the ones that have managed to get married or with any other kind of success no matter how small what is your outlook on life? What advice do you have regarding managing this condition?Although I've also had a rough couple of days I'd like to believe that not all is bleak and that getting access to good stories from people similar to you can certainly help.Please share anything you'd like that might help me and others on this sub.,Personality-disorder
51016,Went to a busy store today Hello everyone hope you're all having a good one! I went to best buy today to pick up a new phone and im ngl it was quite stressful. I had my phone for about 5 years and it was time for an upgrade. The whole process of trading in my phone was so stressful because not only was the employee kinda anxiety inducing to deal with but he trashed my sim card by messing around with the sim tray on my old phone and tried to say my phone was too old and that i can buy a new one because they're cheapSo after all that mess I had to walk to my carrier and the closest one was closed. I was kinda shaking at this point because I felt like my whole day was going wrong but I got kinda brave and took an uber to the other side of town to replace my sim card I lived to tell this tale lol Tldr upgraded phone but best buy employee trashed my sim card so had to journey all over town to get a new one,Personality-disorder

51223,Can you be outgoing and have AvPD? I'm very worried about my brother 29 and not sure how to help him so I've been doing research and a lot of the characteristics of AvPD seem to match. He's my roommate and he hasn't worked in 2 years and just stays home all day on his computer the majority of his time and will not get a job. However his personality is very outgoing and he's like the life of the party when we he is out. He just doesn't want to do anything and my parents said he has been like this since he was a kid. I'm pretty sure he has expressed he feels like he wasn't good enough since he was a kid he's dyslexic so he was never able to get good grades and had to try lots of different schools etc. I don't know how to help him because he says he's fine and doesn't open up to anyone so I really have no idea what's going on in his head.,Personality-disorder
50730,Im scared of going to college Im a senior in high school and after being on this subreddit for a month Im terrified of going to college. Granted I was terrified before that. Before I figured Id take a gap year to figure things out and I didnt feel like I was in a good position to do well in college. But now Im realizing I was just avoiding applying because I was scared to be rejected. Or maybe I was scared of what would happen if I was accepted. I dont know what I want to get into and its scary how relatable a lot of these post feel. And what scares me more is that I keep seeing posts about people having to tell their parents they dropped out of college. Is that going to be me??? Am I just going to be a drop out?? Should I even try?? I dont know but now Im worried Im going to get to comfortable once Im out of school and will be too scared to return. Uuugh everything is so frustrating I wish I could just be normal and I dont know what to do but Im curious to know other peoples experience with college,Personality-disorder
50724,I confronted my kid's teacher today My kid has been having issues with this teacher all year. They really struggle with concentration and memory and the teacher has been terribly unsupportive. It's the only class my kid has been failing.A few months ago my kid was diagnosed with cancer. We set up a 504 to reduce the amount of assignments and give them extended time.They were then out of school for two weeks for surgery. All of their teachers except the problem teacher followed the 504 and greatly reduced the amount of their makeup assignments.Regardless my kid worked hard to turn in a large portion of the assignments. Yet they're still failing that class.I emailed the teacher today to make sure she graded all the assignments. She told me she did but otherwise did not give me any helpful information in getting my child's grade up. I then asked if she has been following the 504 plan and I've not received a response.I've already been second guessing whether I was too aggressive in my emails but at the same time I feel like I'm going to have to escalate it with the school.I'm stressed and I've been fucking sick to my stomach all day. I'm cycling between anger and embarrassment and I'm going nuts.Just needed to vent Edited Thank you everyone for your encouragement. I've been in continued correspondence with the teacher. She stated that she has already reduced the amount of work but I still have issue with the amount and content.I also elaborated on the fact that my child has been having issues all year only in this class. My child has told me they're afraid of this teacher and they struggle with her teaching methods. The teacher had no helpful comments and has only repeated that the issue is missing assignments as if I don't have eyes. She also said she thinks they can turn this semester around if we can motivate them and thinks they are not having academic difficulties. This rubs me the wrong way because motivation starts in the classroom and she's clearly been lacking.PT conferences are tomorrow I'll be talking with the principal.,Personality-disorder
51489,Do you think he might be abusive? As someone with AVPD I don't date much and I just want someone who will be loyal to me. It's very clear that he's attracted to me. I'm attracted to him too but everyone says that I'm way too pretty for him. About two weeks into us knowing each other he shared a really intimate story of a traumatic experience that happened to him. Hes a empathetic person that cares for other people but he gets angry over minor things. I'm 95 sure he's gone to therapy because even though he will explode at the most random times there'll be other times when he's really good at conflict resolution.Before we dated I invited him to my birthday party. Supposedly a few weeks before he was flirting with me but I didnt pick up on it. So when I invited him it confused him. He thought I was giving him mixed signals. On his Twitter that I dont follow he was saying stuff like playing with peoples feelings is bad and disloyal people annoy me. The next several weeks he gave me the cold shoulder and really did not want to talk to me.Hell also roll his eyes or grunt over relatively things that really arent a big deal. Sometimes I wonder if the thing that I did even warranted a sigh or eye roll.

50594,Who is my first love? Have I fallen in love yet? As someone with AVPD I have trouble connecting with people. I know I'm smart and attractive and I care for people but it's my lack of social skills that make it hard for people to see the real me. I've had two guys like me back in the past few years. Which one of them would be considered my first love?The first guy Dave I met when I was 19 on vacation. He and I would just talk at the pool about politics and education even though he was kind of a party guy he has a nerdy side. We only hung out for two days but after our first day hanging out the second day he was really shy talking to me. But our romance was cut short because he had a girlfriend and made the mistake of spilling the beans about his crush on me to other kids at the resort. He cut off contact with me but when they broke up a month later he started looking at my social media a lot. Not to mention he made a playlist about me for my birthday. We don't even talk so I don't know if this is some sort of peace offering or apology. The second guy Steve I met a year later at my job. He and I bonded on the first day of work about growing up in the same hometown and I told my mom that day about how we bonded over our parallel lives. We worked together for a little over a year. And we never went out or anything but he would hit on me a lot. But stupid me was either too dense to realize he was flirting or too surprised in the moment to say any good flirting lines back. But a customer asked me for my number one day and I gave it to him. I guess I kind of wanted to motivate my crush to ask me out but literally the week after he went out with his sister's friend the sister set them up but they broke up and he likes me.View Pollhttpswww.reddit.compoll11wpn90,Personality-disorder

50875,Feeling guilt. I've had the perfect childhood all the opportunities great parents a lot of friends that even now 30 years later are my friends. My parents supported me in everything my mom is the best.Then I got meningitis and everything changed. I was never the same again. Started doing drugs to cope with my emotions yes weed is still an addictive drug partying all weekends with my friends. Xtc was just a normal thing when going to techno parties. It's the love drug... You feel so connected with others on xtc. Everyone was on xtc. Got addicted to weed for 20 years. Luckily I quitted with that 3 years ago.My mom was always worried about me. Now she's 73 years old and still worrying about me. It's my task now taking care of them. But I can't. My dad is dementing. When visiting them I use kratomlegal. I feel normal and happy then. Me happymy mom happy. But it's masking. Not the real me. If my mom sees me happy and positive... And yes... I notice that directly...if my parents are happy and not worrying... I feel better I don't want them to worry. I just want her to be proud she says it doesn't matter. I am who I am and she will always be proud of me. But... I see the difference i can read and feel emotions from others very good.... More a curse than a blessing. Sometimes I can't clean my house cause I feel to bad. And really.. It feels that people care more about that instead of me. The first thing they ask...did you clean. They don't ask... How do you feel.So if someone wants to visit me now I need to know it a few days before the visit. Then I clean even if I feel bad. My mom can't visit me unexpected.She wants to help me... I don't want that anymore. I'm not a kid. Masking my emotions with kratom for seeing people and not worrying them.. Yes I'm not complaining about my life when I see them I'm positive. And I really feel good than. So.. It's not fake... But In a way it's fake. It's making things worse. Not for the outside world they see me when I'm on kratom and don't understand why I'm on healthcare. Sometimes I hear that others are saying I'm taking advantage of the healthcare system. That's very hurtfull to hear.I realize I could have normal life. Just one dose of kratom.. And I feel normal. Like I want to be. But that's not how it works. Now if someone wants to visit me I use kratom for having less anxiety. And yes kratom is a miracle for anxiety depression. A very difficult choice.. Staying at home for weeks or using kratom going to a concert and seeing new people. On my YT channel I'm the most positive person. Making videos talking social. No one has a clue about how I really feel. My biggest fear is losing my parents.. And it's coming closer and closer. I feel so much guilt towards them. I can't even think about that. I owe everything to them. I want them when they leave this earth... I want them to know that I'm doing good. That it's not their fault. They don't need to worry. I will be alright. So they can go in peace. Gonna stop now cause I'm tearing up. Have a good evening.,Personality-disorder

So have you ever had someone you called your best friend and they called you their best friend too?I had friend like this we were best friends for about 19 years. When I left for University then we stopped being in contact slowly.

50790,Resentment towards attractive people I'm sure I'm not alone with this problem but I've been feeling this way for so long I don't even understand how healthy people avoid these feelings.Let's say an attractive girl posts hot pictures on social media. I believe it's natural that this sort of content sparks great desire in any guy. I think it's also safe to say that 90 of guys will never have a chance with a girl like that. So I'd say it should be normal for these guys to feel some resentment unfulfillment jealousy sadness selfdoubt etc.This isn't however what I'm observing in reality.

It all feels too overwhelming for me but being at home makes me feel like trash too...I cant win. I cant sleep right either. I wake up every other hour and im so tired....I feel so angry and anxious lately too because I feel as if everyone hates me and that they're happier without me. My friends hardly talk to me lately.

50821,I have just bailed on a friend for the third weekend in a row I feel pretty bad about it too. Last weekend I had plans I didn't and the weekend before that I actually was sort of going through something. But tonight... I just don't want to see anyone. So I cancelled again.But I am trying to make up for it and I offered to do lunch Sunday he's accepted.I'm unsure if I told him about my disorder and honestly I think he'd not get AvPD anyways. I have had many experiences telling people about AvPD and they just sort of give a wellmeaning but not getting it nod.I have been diagnosed with AvPD for well over a year now and I've been in therapy for even longer so I'm quite good at the whole mindfulness thing. So this year has been all about selfimprovement for me. And I just don't feel ready to go back out into the nightlife. We go to gay bars quite frequently we are both gay. I feel like I'm in my chrysalis as I finally work on myself for the first time like ever. Going out feels like I'm forcing myself to hatch too soon and I just imagine myself as this gooey halfbaked butterfly if I try to go out now. I want to get to my full form to go out and about. And I'm just not there yet.But further going out is a lot of things that could go wrong for me. Where am I going to put my car? Ubers are a lot of money here. What happens if I leave it at his place but I want to go home earlier than him? Etc. etc.Being alone in my apartment is just so peaceful. But it's lonely. And I know if I keep this up when the loneliness becomes too much further on down the road I might not have any friends left to see.,Personality-disorder
51176,Am I just an A..hole? My main way I avoid people is by playing devils advocate being cold extreme opinions saying rude things or sticking to superficial topics. I often compusively make myself the villian with friends. Not because I want to but because having them hate me is secretly doing them a favor. from all the post I've read alot of AVPD people sound like push overs or like eeyore from winnie the pooh. I'm starting wonder how many people play out their AVPD like me or if I'm got some other underlying disorder like odd or I'm just an ahole? Can someone confirm this?,Personality-disorder
50639,I cant sustain long conversations It doesnt matter who the other person is if we are engaged in a conversation the longer it takes the more symptoms I get. At first I am ok then the worry begins in my head where at the same time I am talking I start observing myself. The conversation continues but at this time the symptoms I have been worried about begin to appear my ears turn red my lips start to shake my thinking start to prepare for the impending possibility of having a panic attack while at the same time I start observing that the person I am talking to has now noticed that I am having a reaction. My voice start to tremble as I must make some type of escape. Shame overtakes me as I now know that the other person knows that something just went wrong. I abruptly end the conversation and remove myself now completely drained and knowing that in future conversations with that person this previous terrible episode will be the thing in my head and wondering if it will also be in their head. Later on as days pass I start noticing that the other person also becomes uncomfortable and looks anxious when talking to me but seems happy and relaxed when talking to other people. After sometime I start avoiding them because it takes a toll on me. If it is a place of employment over time I will have many of such episodes with different people and it becomes too much so I quit so I can start fresh somewhere else but I already know what the outcome will be at each new place. I am 56 and have been like that since High School. Some medications have helped particularly Effexor. Also thinking about my lungs breathing and doing mindfulness while conversing have reduced it tremendously but many times I forget to do the work and I get the episodes. This is all from times in my childhood where I was shamed in front of others and ridiculed by aunts uncles grandparents and teachers. One of my grandmas used to on many occasions take her frustrations on me when I did something bad. So for some reason now when I talk to other adults it triggers all of the reactions I had as a child when I was getting yelled at.,Personality-disorder
50964,You have to be twice as good as them to get half of what they have. I sometimes wonder how different my life would have been if I was a little bit luckier? It feels like if you want to beat this thing in some sense you need to be twice as good as them to get half of what they have. Life feels like a video game. Most of us play it on a hard difficulty and we are wondering why are we so far behind other people. Most people are the way they are because they are that way not because they chose and worked hard to be that way. Do you think outgoing social type of person chose to be that way? Maybe in some cases. But more likely than not it wasn't his choice what made him that type of person. But rather circumstances outside of his control things like parenting lack of trauma genetics.I don't know if I ever going to beat it. And if I don't beat it maybe I shouldn't blame myself.,Personality-disorder
51198,Annoying habit of sighing I sigh a lot. It's just a habit I developed after years of fighting my broken brain. And it's annoying because when I am around people and do that it apparently gives them feeling like I am tired of them or even irritated while in fact I am just tired every single second of my life.It's not exactly avpd trait I think it's more about being mentally ill in general. It's especially troubling during my work. No actual meaning behind all that just vent about annoying shit in everyday life.,Personality-disorder
