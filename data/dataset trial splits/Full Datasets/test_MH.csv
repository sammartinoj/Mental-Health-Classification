33893,33913,This is killing me So i had a bacterial stomach infectionpain in the right side thought it was appendix. Doctor gave some antibiotics and the pain went away. But that infection gave me health anxiety for life.Ive been having excessive gas since a month which is mostly due to stress. I was convinced i had stomach cancer but no black stools or blood and Im 20 so doctor ruled that out.Then i was convinced that my kidney failed but no. I googled a lot that night and was sure of it woke up breathless that night.. insomnia took over.Then i was convinced that i have brain tumorgoogle is evil but havent really had even a single symptom.The only concern now is insomnia has been a month now I generally get 68 hours a day but wake up once or twice a night Im generally a deep sleeper.Any solutions?,Anxiety

By day 3 I was no longer feeling the nausea or diarrhea but have a general sense of being unwelldehydrateddrained.

33896,33916,The worst things about hypochondria Hypochondria is the worst thing to ever happen to me everyday Im crippled by it. I guess I just wanted to make a list of all the worst things I go through as a hypochondriac. Seeing healthy people and wishing you were like them even though you probably are healthy but your brain is telling you youre not Changing daily routines based off the health issue you think you have at the time Changing your entire diet to become healthier for me it has been limiting carbs and sugars because Im afraid of developing diabetes Checking your pulse all the time to make sure your heart is beating properly unfortunately for me my heart is never beating normally I have constant heart palpitations and my heart races a lot not even sure if its due to anxiety. Im scared its something serious Having very bad mental health days where you cant leave your house this happens to me a lot Not knowing if your symptoms are caused by anxiety or something serious this drives me absolutely insane Not being able to lead a normal productive for me I cant hold a job because I always fear something bad will happen to me at work and Ill panic Being triggered by seeing things on shows or in movies. For instance a man has a heart attack in the show your watching and then you freak out about having a heart attack Obsessively looking up symptoms and not being able to stop once you start Wasting a ton of money on doctors appointments only for them to say youre okay Being in tons of debt from going to the ER because you think youre dying Always looking for reassurance from others obsessively asking others if they ever have the same symptoms as you so you dont feel alone These are the only ones I can think of right now but feel free to list the things you deal with as a hypochondriac Im curious about what others go through.,Anxiety

For the past few days Ive had this pins and needles sensation all over kind of like a numbness like I can see myself doing thing but I dont feel it the same way. Ive smoked weed pretty frequently over the past few weeks but Im by no means a heavy smoker.

33985,34005,I feel really silly posting this but... I think Ill feel better if I get this off my chest. I definitely have some health anxiety although its not as bad as it could be. I recognize that many of the symptoms I feel from time to time are a result of internalizing stress and are made worse by worrying about them and I think Ive gotten a better handle on it as the years have gone by.But I dont think anxiety can cause lumps or make them grow and Im trying to stay away from Google and redirect my focus but Im still feeling that worry and wanting to check on the lump every five minutes. I think Ive done a fairly good job keeping myself in check and only examining the lump once a day. But Im going to write this out and see if it helps. Maybe someone else has had a similar story and everything turned out fine? I want to hear it if so.Close to a year ago now I noticed this lump under my arm. I thought it was an ingrown hair. Mentioned it at a checkup the doctor felt it and thought it was a lymph node. She offered to do an ultrasound but I was getting ready to move out of state and didnt have time. The lump grew and became really painful and red. For reasons I didnt see a doctor until about eight months later when they diagnosed the lump as an abscess next to a swollen lymph node. Abscess was drained tested positive for Staph I got a gross course of antibiotics and that was that. The lymph node shrank a little after that and I could still feel a lump where the abscess was. Primary care doctor said it was a cyst that had formed form the abscess being left alone for so long and sent me to a surgeon to have it removed. The surgeon was not very nice told me he couldnt feel anything and sent me home. Eventually the cyst shrank and I couldnt feel it anymore. Fast forward to two months later and now...the original lymph node has shrunk but its still around. And now above it theres a new...mass. Its next to where the abscess was before but off to the outside top corner of my armpit sorry for the bad explanation. Its a hard lump and fixed in place which freaks me out a bit because google says thats a sign of cancer. Buuuuuut maybe its just my muscle Im feeling. The other armpit has a bit of that bump thing going on at the top but its way less pronounced and feels less like a defined lump if that makes sense. And it feels like its growing. Thanks to the abscess I have a scar and it feels like the lump is noticeably getting closer to the scar. I feel like such a drama queen. Im so embarrassed bringing stuff like this up at the doctor because Im so used to being dismissed and them thinking Im a huge baby. I just feel ashamed of being like this. Being stuck between worry or embarrassment isnt much of a choice. But this nagging voice in my head keeps saying anxiety cant cause a lump like it could cause a headache or nausea or heartburn or whatever. I just cant cope with the humiliation if it turns out being nothing and they think Im an idiot. I have an appointment with my doctor for something unrelated and not to do with something being wrong with me and Im debating on if I should bring it up. My doctor now seems really good and nonjudgy these feelings are internalized. If someone else has had a mysterious bump that vanished one day and ended up being nothing please let me know. Thanks ,Anxiety
34000,34019,HA for two weeks just discovered what its like Hi allSo the last two weeks have been a ride for me. I've always had a buildup of wax in my left ear runs in the family. A few weeks ago I noticed a ringing noise in my left ear. I went to the doctor and they said it was an ear infection. So I started taking antibios ... didnt go away. So today I went to an ENT who suctioned out my ears and gave me stronger antibiotics and reaffirmed me that this is most definitely a temporary phenomenon and will go away in time 1 week 1 hour 1 month ... he said ears take awhile to heal. I had this confirmed by many of my friends that experienced ear infections as well. The ringing will go away just in time.The problem is... throughout the past several days I spent the majority of my time convincing myself that I had some sort of major illness. The first concern was cancer then that turned into a meningiti then that turned into inner ear concerns then that turned into HIV concerns ...I don't know how I arrived at any of these conclusions. I had no symptoms of any of these illnesses yet I immediately assumed that I had them. No way do I have meningitis I would know by now ... no way do I have cancer it doesnt really run in my family nor do I display any other symptoms. No way do I have aids ... I have not exposed myself in any way that would put me into a situation where it was possible. My friends and peers are all convinced I have anxiety issues and need to see a counselor. I went to one last week and she pretty much confirmed that I have anxiety issues that are beginning to manifest themselves in a moderate form of hypochondria. I literally started checking myself every day for things .... lumps rashes bruises .... I write because I'm curious to know other people's stories. How do you cope with this? This constant anxietydriven fear of having a major disease. I've spent so much time over my break from school researching illnesses conditions symptoms ... trying to connect the dots from anything I could have possibly been exposed to in the past. The slightest itch would terrify me. An ingrown hair on my beltline convinced me I had an STD. In effect I didn't actually live the past week. My worrying sapped away from my actual living. Sorry for the long drawn out rant. ,Anxiety

34023,34042,Im a gay male hypochondriac so anxious about getting HIV. Its affecting my life and relationships. Why do I feel like this? I have always had some form of hypochondria and more recently it has overrun my life and relationships. I am deeply anxious all the time. Im not intimate because of fear even though Im in a monogamous relationship and Im very conscious of my surroundings. For example if Im walking and someone coughs near me I have to look the other way or turn around directions. If someone sneezes same thing. I have to get as far away from them. Also if I go out to eat i have to see food being prepared like sushi or salads in front of me if I notice something off like worker using no gloves or touched something differently I buy the salad and struggle to eat it after inspecting it for blood or bodily fluid many times. I feel like my body is contaminated or some disease is brewing inside me all the time even though my latest blood work last August was all negative. Im a habitual hand washer and sanitizer and I use alcohol to sanitize my razors toothbrushes before every use. I know HIV is very hard to get but over the past couple years i have been tested over 100 times including majority over the counter HIV test for 40 each. This is crippling me and I want to resolve this fear. ,Anxiety
34026,34045,Scary throat problems I had 2 respiratory infections in about a span of a month and when it finally began to clear up I had an persistent globule feeling in the opening of my throat.

Most recently I've been having this electric shock feeling in the opening of my throat when I yawn or sometimes just stretch my neck. I feel like it maybe happened occasionally over the last couple weeks but I feel like the frequency and intensity is increasing with time. Someone please help.,Anxiety
34053,34072,Arm aches symptoms on one side of body Hey guys. I posted here before in mid December about having numbness and weakness on the right side of my body. I went home after finals week and my stress level dramatically decreased as I realized how well I did in my classes and I was able to decompress while at home. I went on a ski trip with my family in the middle of the break right after Christmas and I felt no symptoms at any time during that trip. I felt fantastic. As I came home and started to prepare to go back to school I started feeling anxious that I would fall down into the same anxiety rabbit hole again in the second semester and gradually the weakness and numbness started to come back. Now that Ive been back at school for 8 days and the anxiety has persisted albeit less severe Im still feeling tightness in the right side of my neck and in my right leg as well as weakness and numbness in my right limbs. The symptom that is scaring me though is that my right arm feels dead and I have aches in my shoulder and upper arm that really change in severity depending on the time and on what my arm is doing or where it is.I just feel so stupid about this. Its following the same trends as it did last semester and that all went away when I stopped stressing. Now Im stressing again but for some reason my mind doesnt want to attribute this to the stress and I keep worrying that its a horrible disease coming to claim my life. Anyone have any input on a situation like this?,Anxiety
34058,34077,My Health Anxiety Story and How I am Recovering Hello rHealthAnxiety!Allow me to tell you my health anxiety story and how I am beginning to recover from this psychological illness!The first precursor to my health anxiety was probably almost a year ago to the date when I felt a bump on my shoulder which I thought was a tumor. Of course it ended up being a deeply embedded pimple or cyst and resolved on its own after I went to the doctor who said the same thing. When I went into fullblown panic mode was back in April when I woke up with two puncture marks on my ankle after staying the night at a sister's house. Knowing that they once had an issue with a bat in the attic I assumed that a magical bat had made its way all the way downstairs embedded itself in the bowels of my sister's house and bit me on the ankle. Of course this magical bat must have had rabies too. Spoiler warning but I did not die of rabies and am not writing this as a ghost.My health anxiety probably climbed into a hysteria that consumed me last June. I was going to a university field station when I fell ill. Really ill. Not being able to keep down food or water for three days ill. Thus I flew home as I had missed much of the class and assumed that I was going to die and wanted to so around family. Yet again I did not die but the ordeal had traumatized me enough to sink into fulltime paranoia that I would not escape until October.Except for the occasional stomach ache things were fine for a month from a physical perspective but from a mental perspective if thinking I had terminal skin cancer from a 2mm mole was any indication I was in rough shape. In midJuly I developed the first sign of a rare birth defect that I did indeed end up having. Now before you go into a google symptom allow me to explain what happened my belly button burst open. It was not painful as I didn't know this had occurred for an hour. It wasn't until I looked down and saw that my outie had turned into a popped inside outie. I walked to the hospital and was diagnosed with cellulitis and told to go to a followup with the university doctors. Ultrasound showed nothing. It was only after a CT scan two months later that they saw a 1x2x3 sinus and cyst located behind and below my belly button. The operation was a success and it was removed two months ago. I even got an innie out of the ordeal. In between July and October I had been tested for just about anything and the only thing that came up were elevated liver enzymes and a weirdass belly button.In the meantime I had begun CBT and doubled my dosage of Celexa which is now down which helped a lot. Besides teaching me mindful thinking my therapist became a good outlet to just talk about life and my general grievances that I had been experiencing as a graduating senior from a top state university.To err on the side of caution my PCP sent me to a liver specialist to get my liver checked out. They tested me for any liver ailment you can think of and the only weird thing was my beta globulins ever so slightly out of range think 0.1 out of range when usually 1 or 2 out of range indicates an actual problem. Wanting to be as thorough as possible the pathologist recommended a BenceJones Test for leukemias myelomas and preleukemia. The test came back negative. Specialist ruled that it was just an off result due to my immune system still recovering from surgery about two and a half weeks before and I had had no other symptoms consistently. This final test was taken after Christmas break and ordered before it so despite being told I did not have a deadly illness I stewed over it.And then something happened. Something clicked in my head. I was sick of being prodded at and tested. I looked at my medical information logs for every time I visited the doctor and whenever I was with anyone but my PCP my blood pressure jumped thirty points and pulse went up to 90bpm over 70. Living in America I realized that doctors will NEVER stop running medical tests unless they are sure they have ruled out a condition. They don't want to get sued and if you have the insurance or money WILL run a test if you are insistent enough. This all hit me in about 24 hours. I decided that should that final test come back negative that I would only go to the doctor if anything were seriously and obviously wrong or for my psychiatric checkups. I only google things five minutes a day and I do not talk to my doctors over the patient portal only at appointments.My status has improved tremendously these past two and a half weeks. I wanted to tell you guys that there is hope and what you likely suffer from is a psychological issue. It really is. In seven months the only weird things they could find wasElevated liver enzymes likely prescription or slight fatty liver after a huge barrage of testsMaybe some gallbladder sludgestoneWeirdass belly button thing where if you had it would be very obvious or already addressed in your childhood having it through adulthood so unlikely that they like to write case studies on itAnd guess what? These were and are all very treatable. I came back here to post to tell you guys that it can get better. I felt a twinge in my upper right abdomen and got a little panicked tonight but this was the first time I felt even remotely worried about something in the last two weeks. I don't know if it'll take therapy different meds getting sick of tests or all three but you can get there. Don't give up.,Anxiety

34076,34095,Just looking for some advice. First a little backstory sorry if a bit long. Up until last year I was an extremely sedentary 28yo weighing around 265 lbs. I started a new job that is fairly physical and since then I have dropped down to 230ish. Well last week I was laying down and felt something I never felt before in my chest. I went to the doctor and he said it was almost certainly my xiphoid process. I also mentioned I had a general cough I us an ecigarette as well as a periodical tingle under my right shoulderblade. Other than those three things I felt completely normal.My doctor said everything felt normal my blood pressure was normal as was my pulse and he checked me out with a stethoscope. In the end he ordered an xray to be certain. From that appointment up until I got my results I started stressing out tight chest sweating vomiting trouble sleeping just overall freaking out about what that xray might show. Low and behold I got my result and everything came back looking completely normal. Although that is great news I haven't been able to ditch the tight chest trouble sleeping with bad thoughts and general feeling of just being uncomfortable. I also wear a fitbit to work and constantly find myself checking my heart rate between 59 when I sleep and 120ish when i'm up working. Sorry for the wall of text I am just hoping someone here could give me some tips on managing this stress. I have a yearly physical next month that can't get here soon enough.Thank you.,Anxiety
34084,34103,I am avoidant I have been having muscle spasms and back pain for a little under a year. I have massive anxiety about doctors and phone calls and the health care in my region is not very good. I have been putting off going to the doc for a while and I have developed a rib hump on one side and rib torsion on the other. I have scoliosis I know I do. But going to the doctor and having them tell me I need surgery or won't get better scares me too much to handle. I don't really know why I am posting this. I guess it is nice to get off my chest. Some days it makes me very sad. The fact that I am a hypochondriac makes it scarier that something really is wrong with me. I'm always in pain by the end of the day. I wish I was healthy more than anything. I wish I could carry things and wear push up bras and sleep in car seats comfortably. But I can't. ,Anxiety

Anyone else over think and instead of thinking hey I might be anxiety free today you get anxious about the day and start feeling all the usual symptoms?

34137,34156,Kind of freaking out because of mild night sweats Im a healthy 18 yo male that probably has anxiety issues including health anxiety. Ive never seen a doctor specifically for it because it has never really gotten in the way of my life just occasionally my head. Anyway Ive been experiencing some mild night sweats the past couple days. I wake up an hour or two after going to sleep and my shirt is generally damp. Its not enough sweating to change sheets or anything but sometimes I have to remove my shirt. Ive had on and off night sweats in the past that freaked me out such as last winter when I almost convinced myself I had some type of cancer because well a quick search on google led me to Mayo Clinic and... I think you can get the rest this might have been a good time to see a doctor about anxiety.... Also I had some mild night sweats for a while last month but after I returned home from college they miraculously stopped. Last night was particularly bad in that my shirt was definitely soaked when I woke up in the middle of the night but I just took it off and after stressing over it for a couple minutes got myself to go back to sleep and woke up with no more sweat. I should emphasize that when I really wake up like in the morning I do not wake up sweating. Should I be concerned about this given that Ive had them occasionally before probably when I was really stressed out with school and that theyre pretty mild? I dont want to ignore it if it could be a sign of something bad but I want to stop freaking out about it too. Again these are not beddrenching like google says is a problem. Oh and to make things even more annoying I feel like Im coming down with a cold or something... everyone in my school it seems is getting sick. So throw those symptoms together and you have an overly anxious kid. Thanks for any advice.,Anxiety
34158,34177,Scared about temporal arteritis Adding to all the cancers and heart conditions I've been worried about I just read about temporal arteritis and I'm worried about it too. I'm a 23 year old white male. For the past couple days I've had tenderness near my right temple only. There's no constant pain but it hurts when I put mild to moderate pressure on a certain part of the bone behindunder the temple. I can feel a slight bump there but there's an essentially symmetrical one on the other side with no tenderness with the same amount of pressure. I do have many other symptoms of temporal arteritis including frequent headaches although generally mild tiredness in limbs and general tiredness but I've had all that for a long time and often can be traced to specific causes like poor sleeping habits and dehydration. I don't have any of the jaw pain or tiredness any more so than I would normally get after chewing for a long time anyway although sometimes my mouth does feel slightly stiff if I haven't opened it for a while. I do have a bad habit of clenchinggrinding my teeth that I've had for most of my life and I've had TMJassociated pain before. I don't think I've had any vision loss but sometimes I do find it harder to focus or I feel like I'm not seeing quite as well when I' tired so I can't say for sure. I don't have any other tender points on my scalp just the right temple.,Anxiety
34167,34186,I lost my Dad two years ago and now my Health Anxiety is at its worst... Ive always been a worrier my mum says but in the 2 years since my Dad died suddenly from a heart attack i have had debilitating Health Anxiety. Ive been on 2 different anti depressantsanti anxiety tablets and will feel perfect and then come off them after 6 months feel really good for a while and stable for a few months and then in a matter of 5 mins of feeling something weird happening in my body I spiral into a deep anxious state and the panic attacks start again.

34174,34193,Health Anxiety and Xanax My health anxiety involves fear of having a heart attack or stroke. Ive been to the Emergency Rooms more times that I can count thinking im dying. I went to a psychiatrist and he prescribed me Zoloft daily and Xanax .5 mg to take only in emergencies. Ive been taking the Zoloft for the past week and a half noticing no improvement but ive heard it takes a while for it to actually kick in. I still haven't taken any of the Xanax and it makes me anxious to think about the side effects and hearing stories of people getting addicted to itdying from it. Anyone have any good experiences with it? I would hate for it to make my panic attacks worse. Ive been thinking about taking 1 pill just to know what its going to feel like when im actually having an emergency.,Anxiety

34197,34216,Think Before You Post why reassurance seeking might be feeding your health anxiety. Hey rhealthanxiety Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive. So you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains heart palpitations stomach problems poop problems any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about. You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out but doubt their opinion.All of these have happened to me and happen to many many other HA sufferers which is completely okay. However the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.Usually what I would do is post here explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.All of this felt like what I had to do a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine. In the short term yes it made me feel better but this was only short lived.This might also account for medical tests I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT colonoscopy or endoscopy or whatever it might be would make all their worries go away. Which after the short term relief the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety I speak from experience.One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.So if you don't seek that reassurance what's going to happen? For me at first it was unbareable anxiety and just an extreme desire to check I was okay whether that was through posting to the subreddit the discord asking family checking my body for lumps checking my lymph nodes etc. You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance do something mindful something genuinely healthy for the mind. As when in a very high anxiety situation sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future. You can do many things for me it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else not an easy task by any means but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance. You could possibly try meditation though if you don't regularly practice it it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels. You could try relaxing music your favourite food anything else that enhances your mood whatever works for you. During this time you will experience anxiety potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance but I promise you in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.When you seek reassurance you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately because usually it feels like the right thing and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me try not seeking it.It'll be very similar to this graphhttpsthegirlwiththecurlyhair.co.ukwpcontentuploads201512anxietyrepeatedexposuregraph.png the more you do it the easier it'll be. And it might get to the point where the anxiety almost completely goes after a while of practicing this. Seriously it is worth definitely giving a go and thinking about this if you're currently having a lot of anxiety I've been there hundreds of times and applying this mentality was one of the key turning points into recovering from health anxiety. ,Anxiety
34202,34221,Psychiatrist wants me to get a blood test She says it could show the levels of medication in my blood and if it's effective etc. And if I have a thyroid disorder or diabetes or vitamin deficiency or some other physical reason for my depression and anxiety. Yeah it makes perfect sense to get the blood test.But I swear to God I just don't think I can do it. I am so sure something serious will be wrong with me and I just don't think I can handle it. Last time I had a blood test I fainted when I heard the results which weren't actually bad in any way. Just thinking about it has had me depressed and anxious and crying for days now. I'm not afraid of needles but I can't imagine going to the doctor for the blood test let alone waiting for days for the results. I just don't think I can do it. I don't want to do it even though I know it's objectively a good idea.I'm seriously considering just... not seeing this psychiatrist anymore. I guess I could eventually find one who doesn't demand blood tests.I don't know what I'm asking for here. Advice if you have it but if not can anyone relate?,Anxiety

34216,34234,Fear of getting schizophrenia or any mental illness So my psychologist told me I have gad with obsessive thoughts that are health related. Im very scared of getting schizophrenia yesterday I had a very vivid dream of two people at my school dying. And it felt so real in the dream I passed by a house in a car and two bodies were there and I was crying hard in the dream. I woke up all scared . And I heard a symptom of getting schizophrenia is believing your dreams or something . I havent looked up my symptoms in 2 months and I never will . I know all of this is irrational but Im scared . My psychologist told me that its just anxiety and that I dont have schizophrenia and that Im not developing it. He said hes seen many patients with that illness and Im not like them. Sometimes I have paranoid thoughts when Im in my mind but I know theyre irrational.,Anxiety

34223,34241,Pretty bad anxiety towards taking meds with a possibility to prolong QT. Help. Warning this post got much MUCH longe r than I anticipated. Sorry to however actually reads this entire essay.So I have a psychiatrist who recently prescribed me sertraline for chronic depressionptsd and trazodone for sleep but I actually haven't taken either. This specific phobia started like 11 12 yrs ago I think. I had walking pneumonia a few weeks ago and absolutely had to take antibiotics and Holy shit my anxiety was thru the roof every time I was time to take it. I was absolutely convinced my QT interval was significantly prolonged and I was going to die in my sleep! I feel like I narrowly escaped death after I finished the course. Which is ridiculous.I have had ekgs countless times probably like over 10 times ftr I'm only 18 and only started getting them in the last two years and for the most part were completely 100 normal shocker.... excluding this one time during my purging like 3x a day and keeping literally nothing down phase where my hearts repolarization phase fucked beyond belief.Actually I'm just going to talk about that a little because the anxiety still plagues me. my heart was physically rattling shaking in my chest with every beat like it was unsure of how to beat normally. it was incredibly scary I think I experienced what I believe was possibly a very brief arrhythmia. at first I thought it may have been a minor seizure which wouldn't be that unrealistic as purging electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia. sleep deprivation I had stayed up all night physical activity while literally running on empty we were inside playing basketball when it all started and of course hypoglycemia essentially noteating will do that to ya all lower the seizure threshold and also how i might have had a seizure once back when I was abusing dxm constantly which of course predisposes you to future seizures because of how disoriented I got and how everything became slow motion almost similar to the time distortion one would get on a psychedelic.......but that didn't explain how my heart rate was reaching 140 for the record throughout the last 2ish years that I have been measuring it it has always always sat at a comfy 5560 while not using HRraising drugs such as dxm or speed when I got it taken in the nurses office in the psychiatric facility and how I felt like I was about to die. When I went and got that ekg I believe actually traumatized me in a way. Coming fairly close to death which has actually happened to me a numerous times with my purging phase over exercising phase I actually kept a fucking exercise bike in my tiny ass room and legit would use it non stop for 35 hours to burn off literally everything I ate and then some feeling proud when my net calories for the day ended up in the negative. it was bad real bad restriction phase I have eaten less than 500 calories day for months at a time several times in fact I can feel a restriction phase coming on as I am pushing myself to not eat God I hate being eating disordered but st this point it's a safety blanket after I've been dealing with this shit day n day out since 13 yrs old me first decided to eat like 100 calories a day for 2 or 3 months can't rmmbr cos I was obese. Cant really remember if I started out with disordered thinking and intentions or if it just was a crash dietturned weird obsession and addiction to weight loss. and also this one non eating disorder related time I was riding in a car with my mom maybe 1 12 years ago legit almost got tboned we would have been hit on myher side of the car had we been just 2 seconds slower getting through the intersection that person would have hit us. oddly enough she was panicking yet I f elt absolutely nothing no adrenaline no fear nothing. I attribute that to how I learned to dissociate from everything at. A young age due to my father's husband abusing us constantly lol dissociation as a coping mechanism is cool notI wholeheartedly believe I could have died if I continued with the purging I still get extreme anxiety when I analyze that specific ekg I know I should throw it out but I just can't I am a person who is very much into record keeping. I feel like I am not actually alive that I died months years ago and this is maybe purgatory. I alternate between genuinely feeling like I should truly not be am not actually alive because of all of this shit. Not sure if that's connected to the ptsd or what. I mean I was dxd with major depressive disorder with psychotic features at one point. God my life is a nightmare. I so desperately wish to take the place of a normal person Ie didn't have an abusive biological father isn't a piece of shit drug addict doesn't harm themselves via eating habits and excessive exercise doesn't have all these stupid ridiculous mental things. how did my life end up like this....... I fantasize about it alot. Normal people with normal lives take that shit for granted. It angers me. They just don't understand how goddamn lucky they fucking are Holy fucking shit. Oops sorry for the going off on a total tangent. That happens to me sometimes.Anyway...How do I get over this.... I honestly would not take any med like that on a daily basis unless I had an at home ekg that I could use like 12 times a day. Actually every time I discontinued an Ssri or antipsychotic it as because I could sense that my QT interval was prolonged. Even if the drug was helping me. It's horrible. I have a cardiologist appointment soon because I got minor chest pains during exercise a few weeks ago. Which doesn't sound particularly bad but that coupled with the knowledge of the fact that many people can have silent heart attacks and asymptomatic arrhythmias it's downright terrifying. I am scared about what I might find out if I mayhaps did permanent structural unfixable damage to my heart muscle from a only a several month long bulimic episode and am now much much more vulnerable to cardiac events.... I almost don't want to go. Now what's weird about this phobia is that I currently am using Xanax at night and meth during the day and I'm also a smoker. Its weird how those three things are pretty notgood for you yet I have less anxiety about smoking a cig or a bowl of meth than taking an anti depressant???!???It's so irrational and honestly I believe it's an ocd thing as I also tend to take my blood pressure 420 times a day no fucking joke and weigh my self constantly and also check my pulse to see if my heart rhythm is normal about 10x a day. My blood pressure is so good that even as I am fucking high out of my mind on meth and just smoked a cig the highest it goes is like 13085 which insanely and funnily enough is still probably lower than like 70 of Americas blood pressure lmao which is just slightly hypertensive. It's normally with only the Cigs and no meth like 9060 sometimes even like 8557 no lie. I attribute it to my whole foodplant based diet. I'm not really sure why I still compulsively take my BP. But anyway This anxiety is destroying me. I really do think I need to be on an SSRI or something but I guarantee I could not even take a single benadryl without panicking hardcore.So. Does anyone deal with this fear of an abnormal heart rhythm specifically? I just wonder how common it is. And how people deal with it. end Xanax fueled rant about my mental issues. I would be shocked if anyone actually reads this entire essay,Anxiety
34234,34252,Spinning Downhill All Over Again PLEASE HELP! I haven't been to this sub in over a year. I started stressing about the things I was reading and freaking out more even though I just wanted to support others like they were giving me. I decided to stop googling stop this sub and try to re focus to feel some relief from the anxiety. 2018 has started out pretty rough issues with relationship stress and more stress have been a real struggle. Therapy hasn't been feeling the same neither does school which last year I was so happy to actually be doing. It's a sad time.Between all this I've tried different things to help me yoga some gym journaling hobbies etc. I realize that my life will forever be good and bad days....TODAY IS A BAD DAY!

Maybe I needed a stretch? No...Still going. It doesn't hurt but I've regrettable done something bad. I've let myself have bad thoughts then fueled them with the dreaded Google...PLEASE HELP.I saw where it could be just benign twitching...COULD BE. Last year I went to the gym and may have lifted wrong so the next day I had arm twitching almost all day. But for this case I haven't been to the gym since Monday! Now Wednesday. Can't be that...right?Stress can cause an overload of muscle stuff...even if I sleep? I'm dissecting everything right now. Yes it's been a hard month with you health fears and questions and stress but I'm now like thinking to myself I'm not really that stressed can that truly be the cause?Google sucks it's the worst type of fear enabler yet so accessible. I'm finding so much Lou Gherigs disease??? Ahh!!! I can see the twitch so that's promising but I'm finding it hard to no look up other symptoms...is it possible???Heart issues! I've always been focused on cancer and stuff along those lines but now I'm freak g about heart stuff. My fit bit typically sometimes shows a range of 58119bpm depending on exercise and relaxation etc. I didn't sleep with it last night but as soon as I saw the heart stuff on Google that heart arythmia and skipping beats I ran to put it on. It ran 54 bpm... then at 66 down to 61 bpm granted back In bed in my safe zone but what if my heart is beating too low??? It's slowly shutting off and gave me the leg twitch as a signal?!?!

Hi all this is sort of a follow up post from this httpswww.reddit.comrHealthAnxietycomments7xnd17whentogotothedoctorforrecurringfluI woke up with ear pain this morning in addition to the other symptoms and Ive had recurring ear infections for the past few years so I didnt think it was related to everything else going on. The doctor said that its a middle ear infection and my lungs sounded clear my throat looked fine etc. so the fever and aches are all from the ear. While I was in the waiting room I went and replied to my post above. A few minutes after the receptionist called me up to the desk to get my doctors note for Work and when I got there I faintedlike full on blacked out unconscious woke up confused and surrounded by nurses etc. Ive fainted before but only when needles were involved. The doctor said I had low blood pressure and low blood sugar probably true Ive had no appetite and have barely eaten and the fainting was not because of the ear infection itself. Im home now and my fever is still 100. Im just worried because the ear pain didnt even start until today but Ive had the fever since yesterday.

34327,34344,A whole slew of problems... Normal? I've been dealing with anxiety since September specifically generalized anxiety disorder GAD. Since then I've had a few recurring symptoms that my first doctor had waved off to anxiety but since then have gotten more common. I will be talking to a new doctor soon since I need to get back on meds after my last attempt ended so I will be talking to them about this but wanted others' opinionsexperiences too for comfort especially.I had a huge fear of contracting rabies since I work with animals. I know this is not logical since any animal that has ever scratched me I've never been bit has not had rabies and since even though I exhibited some general symptoms that happened to line up with rabies I've been this way since September. So I'd be dead by now. Some of those symptoms are like I said pretty general and line up with anxietyrelated symptoms. Minor muscle twitching foggy thinking being irritable trouble swallowingdry mouth has never impaired eatingdrinking etc. I also have had a totally random symptom from those which is sharp shortlived pains in my chest and now they're along my lower abdomen and uterus. My new doctor has seen me once for chest pains when they wouldn't stop one day. She said everything sounded fine as far as my heart and lungs I wasn't experiencing limited breathing and the pain wasn't longlived and was sharp not like a pressure or anything. She was hoping it was from acid reflux which I was having issues with but after a month of medicine for that I'm still having that.Has anyone else had sharp chest pains from anxiety?

Elevating it when I can. Even while sleeping. When it popped out of place it started swelling up and the swelling went away about 48 hours later. Now its still a sharp pain and often feels if its going to buckle when I walk too fast or the wrong way. I cant fully bend it because it feels tight and like the muscles or tendons are twisting up.

34363,34379,Can't stop obsessing.. Any tips? Sorry if this is a little long but I'm new here and desperately looking for some advice. Plus it kinda helps to get it all off my chest.. I've been struggling with health anxiety for a little while now and although I keep kidding myself that I'm in control I don't feel very in control. I can't stop the constant worrying and obsessing.It all started just over a year ago when I spent a week in hospital. I'm not going to go into detail as to why as I don't want to trigger anyone else's anxiety... But it wasn't a great week.Since then I've been fine. I have ibs which is unfortunate as the symptoms I get seem to really trigger my anxiety. But that's the most serious problem I have. A few other minor things asthma skin problems but nothing unmanageable.I noticed my anxiety levels shifting around a year on from my hospital stay. Think it must have just been on my mind then I had a really bad ibs flare up that threw me. Was off my food had no energy and lots of other unpleasant things.Ibs is more under control now but my anxiety is not. I feel anxious in general have quite a foggy head alot of the time don't really feel like myself don't want to do much getting tired out easy feel like crying alot. But mostly I'm struggling because I can't stop obsessing about every little thing wrong with me.The slightest cramp or ache sends me spiraling into a panic. I can't stop googling things to find out if there is something wrong with me. Even though I don't really have any ongoing symptoms and they are more one offs. Can't stop poking and prodding looking for lumps or enlarged lymph nodes.Any time I find the tiniest little lump found one or two in the fat layer on my stomach I obsess. Can't seem to stop looking for it to see if I can find it again. Most of the time I can't any if I find anything it's tiny so logically I know it's nothing to worry about. But I just can't stop.It really feels like it's taking over. I just feel like I'm stuck in an endless obsessive cycle of prodding being hyper aware of every tiny sensation looking for things wrong with me a constantly googling.It's got to the point that when I have a nice symptom free day I find myself looking for something that's wrong with me as I feel like i can't trust that I'm actually ok.Anyone got any advice or been in a similar situation? This isn't something I find easy to open up about but I'm scared it's going to completely consume me if I don't do something. ,Anxiety

34386,34402,Fear about having a neurological disease Hey everyone the last 34 days my anxiety have been high and i started noticing some things on my body spasms being what is trully worrying me I noticed i have a very small spasm on my arm muscle and on my leg muscle... sometimes the spasm is so soft that i cant really say if it is really spasms or just my pulsation but this have been driving me nuts today... Im just about to go to sleep and i noticed these spasms on my arm and on my leg happening all the time....they aren't violent they are soft and sometimes it feels like it is my blood pulsation....to make things worse i researched about neurological diseases and seen spasms related to ALS and multiple sclerosis and it has been driving crazy...i need to go to a neurologist but these things takes time and the results might be months from now and until there i will suffer this painful doubt about what my problem is...im really scared to be honest i have developed a couple diseases recently due to the lifestyle of being severely depressed and i got a bunch of health problems...feels these things keep stacking up health problem after health problem...i had a typical hypochondria episode many years ago that was typically delusional but i thought i overcame it....nowdays whenever my anxiety is high i start worrying about health problems that i already have...and symptoms that i wasn't able to find an answer yet...it is still there and it turns my peace of mind into hell..i dont know what to do about this...i am the kind of person that dont ease up until i get answers...i wont be able to rest until i know what i have and it is psychologically painful,Anxiety
34396,34412,Difference between real symptoms and psychosomatic made symptoms? I ask this because I have been going through something extremely odd in the last year. All my medical tests suggest I am perfectly healthy but the symptoms I have been facing with are unlike anything I have experienced before. I am not just talking about your typical anxiety attack and heart palpitations but a constant state of bizarre sensations. My symptoms are severe insomnia Constant irritability Confusion and brain fog what I perceive as working memory issues muscle spasmsjerks vision hearing and skin hypersensitivityI am not looking for a diagnosis just understanding the line between a medical condition and something that is just anxiety.,Anxiety
34400,34416,Scared of Klinefelters I seem to have alot of the symptoms for it low confidence Insecure and anxious and emotional I didn't fit in and I admittedly have some feminine behaviors and I can't grow that much hair. im 17 though I have hair on my lower feet and the hair on my arms are coming in I guess I got wide hips but I got big shoulders and I'm tall. I can only grow facial hair on mustache and chin though it takes a month or two to become somewhat fullish looking but my dad didn't grow facial hair until he was 22. As a kid I was described as somewhat masculine never picked up girl toys and etc but I guess that doesn't really matter. The doctors diagnosed me as autistic when I was 7 and people sometimes confuse Klinefelter behavior for autism but I have a high verbal IQ and I can type fast. My IQ is 100 but Idk. I'm going to get my testosterone tested soon this Monday i'm hoping i'm going to ask the doctor about it. But I'm really terrified and anxious because this would mean everything I thought in my life up until now would be a lie and I also wont be able to have any kids which is the number one thing I want in life is to have kids. The symptoms of Klinefelters seems to vary so I'm just worried on having it the only thing I really care is about the most is if I'm able to have kids with my girlfriend. I'm just making this post here to vent sorry if its a bit of a nuisance I'll delete it soon. EDIT Yeah I also have a history of hypochondria I'm just really worried. ,Anxiety
34420,34436,Flomax Capsule I have an issue swallowing pills but I spent half an hour today trying to get a flomax pill to go down by chasing it with water. Eventually the pill cracked open from sitting in water for too long and I went ahead and swallowed about less than 13 of the little beads inside the capsule. I hear its dangerous to consume a pill that is crushed or broken down because it gives you large dosage at once. The good part is that I didnt swallow even half of what was inside the flomax pill. However Im second guessing myself and wondering if I should get checked at the ER or just wait it out.Any ideas? Is pill crushing as serious as its made out to be? ,Anxiety
34424,34440,Retinal detachment flashes How exactly do they look like? A month ago I discovered I have floaters and I am only 20 years old. Read around for a while and discovered that the appearance of floaters is a usual sign of retinal detachment. However it will also be accompanied with partial vision loss and light flashes.What do those flashes look like?Are they like shooting stars?Like a camera flash?Or like half or all vision suddenly gets brighter like its 12pm in the middle of a desert?The thing is I sometimes feel like there's something flying by so fast like a fly or something. It happens once or twice a day when it's night and usually on the sides.Should I be worried?,Anxiety
34434,34449,Hard lymph nodes on mastoid bone and back of neck. Hello Reddit.Im a 28male6'7200lbs.For months now I've had two rock hard lymph nodes behind my ear on the mastoid bone. On top of that I've had one right next to my spine on the back of my neck right around my hairline. I've been having some neck pain and headaches non stop for three months. I've also noticed I have some brownish skin spots in my hairline. I've also noticed if I dig my fingers down in my skin near the node in my neck it feels like I can grab this round lump.I've been to the doctors and they brushed it off. they assured me its not canceris or anything like that. They me on some antibiotics a few months ago and it did nothing. They're not red or painful. They're hard and kind of fixed in place. They aren't growing either. They've been the same size the whole time.I get this is a long shot but I'm not sure what to do. Could the ones behind my ear be rock hard because it's right on the mastoid bone?,Anxiety
34442,34457,Awful feeling of dizziness and brain fog when standing? Just recently Ive been experiencing a lot of dizziness slight heartburn stomach aches and heat flashes. Heat flashes arent exceptionally uncommon for me. I also get a lot of stomachaches. Im not too worried about those. I have bad anxiety in general to begin with so when I started noticing around Tuesday or so I was getting this dizzying brain fog sort of thing I really began to freak out. Ive never experienced it before and Im worried its something serious. Im chalking it up to stress right now just had a family death general school stress being broke lack of sleep etc but Im really worried. It hasnt stopped. I feel like Im about to faint frequently. Its weird to describe but its almost like my brain is going a few steps too far ahead of my body. Sometimes vice verse. I stumble a lot when it happens and often need to hang on to something to steady myself.Ive noticed this is mostly happening when I stand. Its not as frequent or severe as when Im laying down which makes it really hard to get stuff done. I dont think its dehydration or a lack of sleep either. Ive been getting 10 hours of sleep in since it began and Ive been drinking as much water and Gatorade as possible.Has anyone else experienced this? Should I be calling a doctor?,Anxiety
34448,34463,So I found a bump on the right side of my head in front of ear On my left side I dont seem to have a lymph node there. I saw a doctor and they said what it was was just a lymph node. Can I have a lymph node on one side only? Kinda freaked out,Anxiety
34472,34486,Worried I have worms in my brains among other bizarre health anxieties. For the past several months I've been on a huge parasite scare that came out of seemingly nowhere. I even had stool samples taken again several months ago and everything came back negative. But now I'm thinking maybe the samples weren't great. Apparently they do their testing kind of hastily sometimes so I'm thinking of doing a second batch of samples.Anyway... I always thought that tapeworms were just an intestinal parasite. But then I read that they can spread to other organs too including your EYES and BRAINS. Christ. So naturally I look in the mirror every day to make sure there aren't any worms in my eyes. I also check my stool with every bowel movement. And now I'm worried that the larvae of this hypothetical worm has spread to my lungs I've been coughing a lot lately and brains as well would explain my headaches and why I feel so spaced out.I've also had to take my cat to the vet a couple times because she was diagnosed with diabetes so naturally I'm worried about fleas as well now. I just saw some kind of small brown bug on my floor one of my cats spotted it that bounced around a couple times before I killed it. Now it could've just been a moth that was struggling to fly but it could've also been a flea. Right? And infected fleas carry feline tapeworms that are even worse than regular tapeworms if they spread to humans.So yeah it's 3 AM and I'm going over all of this shit in my head unable to sleep.I guess I should mention I'm also worried about going blind as my astigmatism has been getting worse and I found out about something called keratoconus which I may have and I also have all kinds of pains in my body around pancreas and liver especially so I could also have cancer. Or maybe those are just the cysts formed by the larvae of the tapeworm.And I do also worry about earlyonset dementia and stuff like that but that's kind of taken a backseat while 90 of my mental energy goes into worrying about worms.,Anxiety
34482,34496,Same illness for two years in a row! Need advice Could be TMI but here it goesSo this started in March 2016. I started noticing that just before I peed I felt a sting every time before I passed urine. This when on for 23 weeks then I got really scared and when to the doctor. They prescribed a urine test and also prescribed some medicines for UTI. The results came back negative for a UTI. A couple of days later I had a really upset stomach with nausea and my roommate had to take me to the hospital. And I mentioned to the doctor about my prior visit. He prescribed another urine test checked my penis for any issues I also felt some tightness in my foreskin. He couldn't find any issues. And this urine test came back negative too. I was starting to panic as I the situation was not getting better. So I had to fly back home to see another doctor i was in college btw. Another doctor another urine test and the result nothing nada zilch!It was same for some more time and then I started feeling gassy along with the initial symptoms. I got prescribed some gas relief medicines and that was it. All in all this went for couple more months then the sting before peeing gradually went away.So now a little over a year later in June 2017. The same symptoms returned. And the same progression of symptoms occurred the stinging sensation and few weeks later the gassiness etc. But it was worse this time around I had a very bad heart attack scare with symptoms like pain in the chest my left arm going completely numb and gassiness. So I was rushed to the hospital where they performed an ECG. I had a fever too. They concluded that nothing was wrong with me. Oh yeah I had another urine test a couple of days earlier and it was negative. Amidst all this chaos I had to travel and it had a 32 hour travel time. So obviously I wasn't looking forward to it. And my nightmare came true. I finished that journey with constant gassiness nausea and uneasiness. So I guess I'm not in a hurry to ever take on that long a journey ever again in my life. So these symptoms finally improved but painstakingly slowly 4 months.So my concern now is that it gonna be April soon that means I might get this stupid mysterious illness again. What do I do? I feel about 70 just might be my head which is causing all of this anxiety.Also i feel I was misdiagnosed everytime. The doctors always brushed it off with Your results are fine don't worry about it.,Anxiety

34526,34540,Terrified of brain amoeba fowleri Hi everyone. I'm down in South Australia and I've found myself going a little insane over something very silly for the last day....I will start by saying that our water has a decent amount of chlorine as far as I can tell it's the only thing you can taste in the water and if you fill a bathtub it's even ever so slightly green. There's never been an order to boil water or anything of the sort either here.So moving onto story time. I often get itchy eyes before bed so I keep a glass of water in the bathroom that way I can rinse my eyes out quickly to calm things down the glass of water had probably been out for a few hours anywhere from 6 12. Last night I did it and as the water ran down my face a little bit got in my nose maybe a drop or 2 tops. I started freaking a minute later as I remembered all I'd read about fowleri.... I blew my nose a bunch and I rolled up some toilet paper and stuck it up my nostril as well in an attempt to deal with any water that had made its way up there. I spent a terrified hour in bed reading things on my phone and eventually calmed down enough to sleep.Now all day today I haven't had a fever or anything of the sort but I have been getting sinus headaches. Quite possibly from blowing my nose so much And I got rather paranoid in the shower too anytime water got near my nose or even the tiniest bit might have entered I freaked out a bit. My right nostril which is the one the water entered is also worse than the left but the discomfort might just be from me freaking out and blowing it a ton... I have bad sinuses at the best of times so it could just be dust or allergies too.I know I'm probably being silly but some confirmation would be lovely especially since the glass of water while cold was sitting out a long time... A day of sinus headaches just doesn't exactly fill me with confidence even if it probably was cause I wouldn't leave things alone. One last thing to note is that 2 family members of mine recently had colds so that might be why I'm feeling crappy sinus wise too the right side being worse than the left still has me all freaked out though.,Anxiety
34538,34551,Stressful anxietyridden past few months So I just wanted to start off by saying that this community has really helped me to calm down by knowing so many others are going through similar things as myself. Everyone is also so kind and helpful to one another which is even more reassuring.I've always had a little bit of health anxiety since I was a child e.g. thinking I have appendicitis when I have a pain in my right lower stomach but for the past several months I have been in constant panic mode. It all started when I went to the ENT in December she removed the wax from my ears which I've had done before and then a few days later I had intense ringing in my ears a clogged feeling in my right ear headaches and dizziness. I was googling like crazy which made things even worse. That ringing and googling led to what I now know were panic attacks in which I was feeling disconnected from the world and having episodes of shaking like the chills amongst other symptoms. Long story short and countless ENT visits later where they didn't find anything wrong with me I then went to the dentist who said I most likely had a TMJ disorder as a result of grinding my teeth which I thought would make me feel better. But obviously it didn't and I just started to get different symptoms instead. I have been having a random tic in my neck in which it will randomly slightly jerk my head. Sometimes I get a little spazz in my leg or my arm as well and a twitch that will last for a second or two in random body areas. I also have like a shaky feeling on the inside which will sometimes lead to my fingers or toes being a little trembly. I recently have been getting floaters in my eyes which I'm not sure if I've always had them and just never noticed or if it's something new my vision has been bad for years. Also I randomly have visual snow which I think I've also had for a while but was never really concerned about until now. I feel like I am so hyper focused on my body and I just don't know how to get out of this phase.I am only 23 and I feel like I am going crazy. I'm in my last year of grad school right now and currently doing an internship in a hospital for speech pathology. So not only am I at a super stressful time in my life but I am around these disorders such as ALS Parkinson's MS etc and the fact that I see these disorders frequently makes me even more nervous because they can really happen to anyone! I am caught between that 1st year medical school syndrome thing and going to the doctor to see if there is something to actually be worried about. I stopped googling my symptoms which has helped a great amount but this anxiety has not fully gone away. For anyone taking the time to read this thank you. It is a little bit of relief being able to express my feelings instead of keeping them inside.,Anxiety
34539,34552,CT Scan coming up. I went to my primary a few weeks ago for what I suspected was a UTI. Turns out it wasn't and I was referred to a urologist. The doctor made me extremely nervous said there was some trace blood in my urine and wants me to go in for a contrasting CT scan and then have a cystoscopy. I'm beyond to pieces right now. I haven't been able to focus at work or at home. I just keep thinking it's cancer even though there's no history in my family of bladder or kidney cancers and I'm only 29. It's all I can do not to google myself into a panic attack. The tests are still a week away does anyone have any advice or any stories of similar events that might help me get through the next week.,Anxiety
34550,34563,Feeling stupid lately... Alright so Im 16m have health related anxiety and have had this sort of thing before. Maybe someone has something wise to say.So I constantly worry about losing intelligence Im a pretty bright guy but I often worry that this attribute is slipping away from me. Im rather insecure about this.I work at a swimming pool thats under construction. There were diesel fumes in the pool the whole 3 hour shift. They were bad enough at one point to give a coworker a headache and at least one patron turned right around when she came in and smelled how and it was. Mgmt didnt close till the last 30 mins! I was one of the last on the deck. Didnt really get a headache though. Anyway I own a juul I was using that before and after. So nicotine exposure. Havent used it for a few days. Also I drank a bit with friends the night of that work shift. Continued using the juul and drank more the night of the next day. Also I was at higher altitude for two days after this but only 2000 ft higher than the 5000 of my hometown. Back home and still feel what Im about to describe. I feel like my memory has been shitty since this and my mentalcognitivelinguistic abilities down. I feel dull. Ive had scares like this before but this feels different. Is this just anxiety? Anxiety seems to cause very real physical symptoms for me but I feel less stressed than I normally would during this type of episode. Anyone have any words of advice? EDIT Forgot a MAJOR component I got a meningitis vaccine the day before the second drinking incident. Not an antivaxer at all I just was worried about the interactions between all these in relation to my memorymental issues recently. Kinda reinforces my point that I forgot this big part which was a primary part of my thoughts about this ,Anxiety
34576,34587,I need new ways to cope Im 26 year old female and Ive been struggling with health anxiety since I was 17.Whenever Im sick or hungover my heart starts racing and I have a hard time calming down or sleeping. Ive been to the doctor about my heart and everything always checks out as normal but I cant keep the anxiety and worried thoughts away. The best form of coping that Ive used is showering. On a bad day Ill shower around 56 times a day. It seems to be the only place I can meditate and really relax and get my HR down. Im lucky to have at least that but its not very practical especially when Im trying to function with my day to day responsibilities school work socializing. I need something else to get my heart to calm down. Breathing exercises or meditating outside of the shower never works for me because I cant calm down enough to focus.Ive never posted on here before but this sub is regularly helpful to me and any responses are appreciated.

34615,34625,Heart Disease depression anxiety and stress This semester I am taking Abnormal Psychology. One of the chapters I had the misfortune of reading was on the physical health effects of negative emotions something I am chocked full of. Whether its stress anxiety depression angerfrustration I show it. My mood bounces around a lot. Even at my young age of 23 I am starting to worry about developing heart disease something my neurotic nature seems to be a predictor of. Most of my life I've eaten a poor diet although my cholesterol was only 150 with my LDL at 88 and my HDL at 30. No idea about cortisol CRP or interlukins though. I have also been pretty sedentary though that is very slowly starting to change since I turned 18 and have had a slew of medical problems since then. My gums have receded more I fought off gingivitis but am on the cusp of developing gum disease from gum recession. I used to get very angry at video games I developed tinnitus a year ago which drives me crazy and I'm depressed and socially isolated. I have no know history of heart disease but of depression and low serotonin. Thus I am stuck in a dilemma. I also started taking amphetamine mediation for ADHD in January so my heart rate tends to be higher on average but I eat less and have lost weight. In some cases my blood pressure is normal on stimulants even when it feels elevated. I'm paranoid about my health a bit of hypochondriac. I vape don't drink anymore and and am an on and off smoker. All of these things and more point to heart disease. I cannot just relax however and I refuse to take antidepressants. I detest those medications and will take any medicine for depression that is not an antidepressant or antipsychotic. Even at the cost of my life from getting heart disease I will risk low mood higher inflammation and more clotting and an early death than take those. I have often been pointed to exercise as the key which I will do in the form of jogging. I will not do yoga even if its relaxing because I think its a stupid form of a exercise. I want a form of exercise where I can feel angry and aggressive. Maybe that defeats the point but at least its something. I need some answers within my confines. Diet changes are hard because I'm a picky eater and will throw up if something doesn't taste good. Regular good sleep is also out of the question because for some reason I rarely sleep more than 45 hours consecutively. Exercise is pretty easy I'm just a bit lazy. I'm open to ideas but antidepressants are absolutely out of the questions. ,Anxiety

34652,34660,Palpable lymph node Im terrified... So two and a half weeks ago I went to the dentist with a tooth that was shaky after a previous filling had fallen out. Id been feeling a bit weird in my throat on the same side too. She looked it and firstly said it appears I have gingivitis. She had to extract my tooth surgically by altering the gums and said it was infected so put some medicine in it and temporarily closed it. The next day I went back and she opened it all up and then sutured my gums back together. When she checked my lymph nodes mainly under my neck I directed her to the mandibular node which had been noticeably hard for maybe a week before. She called it a palpable node and said it could be due to the infection and the antibiotics amoxicillin she prescribed should take care of the infection. Well almost three weeks later and Im freaking the fck out. My infection appears gone and Ive had no pain on that side since the extraction. My lymph node is still as palpable as before but whats worrying me is that its painless whereas when its an infection its usually quite tender? Its hard but a bit rubbery and moves around. It couldve been around a lot longer than just the three weeks its been since I need to push it out a little from against my jaw to feel it but I can REALLY feel it. I had a couple of random lumps in my armpit groin and side as well and whilst it felt hard they had sort of pus coming out of the end so I assumed they were harmless as they went down after a couple of days. This was before the dentist. Im scared its lymphoma. The reason for this isNight sweats Ive had this onoff for the past few years however. But Ive noticed it again despite keeping cool. Temperature regulation out of nowhere Ill get quite warm and then get a bit chilly again. The node is pretty much painless but despite the infection going its still the same size and hardness. General fatigue but I have that anyways recently its been muscle achesIm a smoker... and at times in the past year Ive been very heavy. Im just freaking the fck out. Can anyone let me know if they had anything similar? Or just put my mind at ease?I know I should go to the doctors but Ive just built up such a resistance to it with how much anxiety Ive had over it. I fear having to face the issue and find out I have something serious. Im booking a GP appointment for a couple of days time. But until then anyone have a clue what this could be? its slowly consuming every second of my life. ,Anxiety

34659,34667,Selfdiagnoses panic attacks and hope Here's my story. Last summer I convinced myself that I had intestinal parasites and kind of lost it. I finally went to the doctor and it turned out to just be a yeast infection health anxiety right?. Well it was a really intense yeast infection. Got it under control after finishing medicine from doctor and then purchasing OTC medicine. Then I started noticing that my digestive system was totally out of whack and was experiencing a constant fatigue and strange stomach aches that would appear out of nowhere in my lower abdomen. The aches would be sharp and burning I felt like I got a hot flash and then they would go away after only 1 or 2 minutes and I'd feel fine. So I convinced myself I had a stomach ulcer thanks WebMD. I conquered my health anxiety once again and returned to the doctor. Up to this point I've never had any real health issues in my life and pretty much never went to the doctor unless I got sick. Except that I was diagnosed with high risk HPV which had recently been clearing up. That's another story. So they do a breath test for H.pylori and take my blood. The blood test shows I have elevated bilirubin and they do an abdominal xray and ultrasound. No stomach ulcer. And nothing in the xray or ultrasound that indicates something wrong with my organs. Around this time I begin having panic attacks because I feel like something is very wrong with me. And then my skin on my face goes insane. Small red bumps everywhere and flaking off all over and so much redness. I get a prescription cream and it gets worse. I also get a prescription for a mild anxiety medication. The anxiety medicine makes me feel SO light headed which triggers more anxiety because I feel light headed when I have a panic attack. I started a glutenfree diet because I felt like it matched some of my symptoms. Started taking probiotics every day and my digestive issues have gotten so so much better. I went in for a followup blood test that showed my bilirubin levels are now normal. I realized the lightheadedness of my medication was caused by consuming grapefruit. I've finally gotten my skin under control with daily chemical peels and tea tree oil and it's improved a lot though still nothing like it used to be. So I've made a lot of progress. However I still feel very fatigued most days. While glutenfree has definitely helped and I think I'm getting a better hold on my anxiety in the back of mind I'm still afraid something is wrong. Can anyone relate? I'm reminding myself that I've made a lot of progress and I think my initial health scare just triggered this health anxiety that I had never had before. ,Anxiety
34679,34687,Pain in left thighleg and muscle spasms freaked out about DVT again I've been afraid of DVT since early March because I have had various weird spasms and pain in my left leg. It happened twice that I woke up with immense pain and cramping in that leg. This happened to me when I was a kid sometimes but I don't remember if it was just in one leg then. I've had two doctors tell me that my pain and symptoms don't match those of DVT and that I need to stop Googling so I'm laying off the Google now...The pain was mostly gone the last two weeks but right now I have a lot of cramp and a burning sensation in that same leg again and it seriously makes me anxious.I also have another issue. I got meds for my anxiety gabapentin and lexapro but I am afraid to take them because of the possible side effects. I have been taking gabapentin but it only helps for a few hours. Lexapro seems more dangerous and I don't know if I'll just worry myself by thinking about the symptoms. Anyway thanks for letting me get this off my chest. ,Anxiety
34681,34689,Your honest opinions please! Ok so I have struggled with hypochondria for going on three years now. Last night my girlfriend was puppy sitting for a coworker and I stopped by to bring dinner and hang out with the cute puppy for a while.As puppies do he was a little bit of a biter and at one point he got in a little deep just above my elbow on my bicep. I pulled my arm away but it dragged a little bit and drew a little blood so i assumed it punctured the skin. He's only a few months old and apparently he went to the veterinarian four days ago. I haven't confirmed that he got a rabies vaccination there. I think he would have but I don't remember what all my dog got when i took him home two years ago. This puppy who bit me came from a shelter. So please tell me honestly should I be worried about rabies? Should I go to the doctor just in case? I could use a level head's perspective on this.,Anxiety

34767,34775,Helping Twin Brother Deal With Health Anxiety My twin brother 23 m has been suffering an extended episode of anxiety for about a month regarding terminal illness and neurodegenerative diseases. Two years ago he needed to have surgery for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome which was a major anxietycauser. Long story short his arm swelled up and he needed to be taken to the hospital learned he had blood clots in his lungs and spent the rest of the year on blood thinners to prepare for his first major surgery. Since then he's been extremely wary of any aches and pains he feels. This December his arm started hurting and he got an infected salivary gland. That combined with it being around the two year anniversary of his surgery triggered major anxiety symptoms. Since then he's had aches and pains tingling fatigue headaches all proportional to the level of anxiety he feels at the moment.He recognizes this too. He knows that anxiety something we have been officially diagnosed with combined with the hypersensitivity that comes from being on the Autism spectrum is the most logical explanation for his symptoms. But there's always that doubt and that causes more anxiety. According to the anxious part of his brain he's had MS some kind of cancer or some obscure disease that he read about on Wikipedia at some point. We have no family history of cancer MS or any weird diseases and we live extremely healthy lifestyles. He even went to his doctor to see what they thought. His blood pressure is perfect and a blood test came back with the only problem being a Vitamin D deficiency. His therapist has assured him that everything he's feeling is textbook anxiety. Despite this he still gets panicky about every little twinge he feels. It's making him to lose sleep causing him to feel tired and fatigued during the day and giving him more anxiety. It's a selfsustaining cycle.Him describing what it's like to be in the middle of an attack I feel like I'm dying and no one believes me.Now I suffer from health anxiety myself but for different reasons. I hate catching colds because they're basically a constant sensory overload for me. Besides that I've had existential crises and a bout of Alice In Wonderland Syndrome yes really but all of these things are or were made far worse by my anxiety about them. I've been able to get through to my brother by talking about my own experience but that only seems to work temporarily.I'm looking for advice Does anyone here have family members with health anxiety? If so how do you help them? Has anything worked for you? I hate seeing my brother deal with this and I just want to do what I can to help.ampx200BOh and don't hesitate to ask for more details or clarification on anything!,Anxiety

I'm 28 not super active but not overweight. 5'3 126lbs... i guess i'm wondering what it is because it didnt just gradually get there and i've never been hugely overweight so I don't know how likely it is to have loose skin there at my age weight?

34817,34824,Being persistent with doctors or accepting the 'health anxiety' label and just accepting it? Whats your opinion. So to start off i'm a binge drug user so i occasionally binge on most things meth cocaine heroin etc so i recently developed health anxietyapparently along with lots of pricks and pains in my hands feet eyes pretty much anywhere really nothing chronic but enough to make me panic so i'm wondering should i persist with doctors to fix this or just deal with it. I'm so fed up with being afraid once i sat in the hospital emergency room parking lot snorting cocaine waiting for my heart to mess up so they could figure out the problem and fix itI know that is dumb lol. Just getting desperate and annoyed. Also along with health anxiety my drug use now is almost 0 due to the fear maybe a good thing? Sure doesn't feel so.,Anxiety
34827,34834,IBS and Other GI Issues...Anyone Else? It's so crazy to me kind of comforting that there are 10.8 thousand subscribers. I feel slightly better knowing I'm not alone. So onto the issue at hand. I was diagnosed with IBS four years ago. Ever since I have had different episodes of constipation and diarrhea and like such intense gas discomfort that I could feel the spasms in my intestines. I've had an ultrasound to give me peace of mind that my abdomen is clear of anything sketchy. About a week ago I had an outpatient procedure done and needed to take a high dose of antibiotics. 1000mg of aziththromycin. Well I have been so constipated and I mean my water intake hasn't been the best I have been super stressed out anxious overwhelmed my diet hasn't been great...it's been mostly in n out pizza etc...and yesterday I started feeling this weird pressureuncomfortable pain in my actual butt. Like the same muscles I use to pee operates that back there too I think and it feels just not great when I pee or sit down too hard etc. Has anyone ever felt this way? I've been able to pass a little bit of poo but not much. Really trying to talk myself off the anxiety ledge thinking of bowel cancer or if the fibroid I just found out about 5 days ago might have super grown and impacted my colon...I am a straight mess guys. Any input would be great. ,Anxiety

34837,34844,I'm spiraling right now. What do you guys do. How do you cope with it. Just need a shoulder to lean on and a friend to talk to. Recently just moved to a new city for a new job and I am all by myself in my apartment. I don't have furniture yet and I am still sleeping in an air mattress right before I moved I had a muscle strain and the doctor prescribed me a short dose of prednisone. I started to get real bad side effects at the end of the course and my blood pressure is shot up. Went to the ER and was told not stress out and that it was just anxiety and the drug clearing my system. My intial BP when they took it was 18097 and thenback secs later dropped to 16393I was thirsty and urinating all the time. I was convinced I had diabetes and high blood pressure. All while moving to a new city amp new job. Then began experiencing really bad heart issues coupled high blood pressure. Tried to just relax but still stressing. Then yesterday had a blood in my nose all day which freaked me out so much. I stupidly kept picking at it with my finger to check throughout the day. It never ended had blood in my nose from 8am to 5pm was freaked out went to the ER doctor prescribes me a bunch of antibiotics and steroids. Looking back I am in shock on how I just kept sticking my finger in my nose because I was so anxious. Now I am hardcore stressing over catching MRSA or staph because didn't wash my hands before and was in the hospital. Then today spit up blood that lasted for about 30 mins. Thought I was dying. Called 911 Em's came and they were not to concerned looking at the amount of blood the fact that I was being treated for blood in nose. I'm currently convinced right now that I have a deadly bacterial infection and will die this weekend all while having high blood pressure. Reading consistently is 145155ishover 9580ish range. I have always been 12070. Can stress keep this Bo so high for weeks on end. I have no friends here yet and family is across the country. Help I'm destroying my life with this.,Anxiety

Now I'm mildly nauseous when I stand up which gives me some chest pressure which freaks me out. That makes it hard to breathe and causes typical anxiety symptoms which also feel like heart attack symptoms!I'm doing a little better since I woke up my SO to keep me company and humming sort of makes the anxiety go away because I can feel the hum in my chest.

34913,34920,At what age did your HA start? I have always been a bit uneasy about medical problems but didnt start feeling physical symptoms until about a week and a half ago. With no triggers or life circumstances to speak of my brain started telling me I need to take deeper breaths than I am capable of taking.

Most people I know had it start at a much younger age. Any other late bloomers here?,Anxiety
34915,34922,Stressing a little of medication side effect Hi! I've been having issues with constantly feeling like I need to pee and not emptying my bladder for a few months now although all medical tests have indicated there's nothing at least structurally wrong. I am a male. I was prescribed 0.4 mg Tamsulosin HCl aka Flomax which relaxes the muscles in the pelvic area and muscle tension and anxiety are suspected to be the cause. I read through the booklet I got with the medicine and I just have concerns about the fact that one of the side effects is retrograde ejaculation where semen enters the bladder instead of leaving the body...sorry for putting that image in everyone's heads. It itself is not a serious symptom and I know even if it does happen it will go away when I stop taking the medicine. I'm only taking it short term too. I guess basically does anyone else also get stressed out about side effects? Any mental tips on how to stop being so crazy about it? Of course I know rationally that my doctor decided the benefit much outweighs potential risks and that they always put every possible side effect because that's just legalese and what not. It's ridiculous because I know this medicine was given to me to HELP me! But this crazy irrational side of me can't just relax and take it.. ,Anxiety
34917,34924,Can a lot of strenuous intense exercise after each other in a day cause heart damage? It was more than a week ago where my heartrate was high all day. For some reason I believe I damaged my heart without feeling any significant pain. This kind of thinking is fucking scary. It sends you right down the rabbit hole of anxiety. My heart was tested extensively almost a complete year ago and it turned out well.But then I rationalize that something bad happened and my perception of my beating heart becomes clearer and clearer and I feel it more and more.I don't know what to fucking do now. I am too lazy to go to a doctor again to test myself for the so manyth lt not a word time. But I have to.. Or not? Or do I.. I might die if I won't.. I'm fucking scared. Normal people won't go to the doctor when they feel nothing.. Or do they? What if my body is suffering in silence? Oh my fucking God. I cannot die.,Anxiety

34976,34980,Anyone else here with HA who works in a biomedicaldiseaserelated field? Hi everyone! This community is a great support on days I'm feeling bad and I've had this question on my mind for awhile. I've struggled with anxiety my entire life officially diagnosed w GAD when I turned 13 and have been on medsin therapy since. One component of my anxiety is bouts of severe hypochondria that wax and wane as far as I can remember my earliest memory of this is crying to my mom because I was terrified of having cancer and dying I was 7. While I was terrified of diseases I was also fascinated by them. I remember watching Mystery Diagnosis episodes when I was in middle school which while super cool to me when watching would result in me later being terrified by whatever disease the episode featured. When I began seeing a therapist and psychiatrist I got very interested in mental illness and later that led me to an interest in neurological disease in high school which eventually as it turned out morphed into my career. Very longstoryshort I ended up getting my undergraduate degree in neuroscience and am now a 1styear PhD student in molecular biology where I study protein misfolding in neurodegenerative diseases. For someone who spent much of their life with bad HA it's very ironic that so much of my time is now spent attending lectures on disease and taking courses in pathology. I still struggle with my anxiety but regularly see a therapist amp psychiatrist to keep things in check. My experience has led me to wonder if anyone else in this community has a biomedicalresearchdiseaserelated job? If so I'd love to hear your stories. ,Anxiety
34984,34988,Canker Sore Is this cancer concerns. So every now and then when I drink I chew tobacco. Over 2 years I have done it 6 times and probably a total of one can of dip across all of that. Anyway I chewed 10 days ago or so. And a few days after I had was eating chicken and cut my lip on a bone. It's been 8 days and the cut turned into a canker sore. It seems to be healing and the pain from it is less every day. But my mind is convinced it is cancer from my very light tobacco use. Rationally I know it isn't but still anxiety is there. Ugh.... ,Anxiety
34994,34998,New Here Unfortunately Hi all. I am new to this forum and thought I might gain some reassurance from others who are having the same issues as myself. The last year or so has been filled with a few periods of time in which my health anxiety peaked. This often left me confused and helpless. Everything I feel or see makes me question if I am becoming seriously ill in some way. About 3 years ago I had my first issue with HA. I was having chest pains while playing baseball at school. I actually ended up going to the hospital for this and had an ECG. I was told that my heart was fine and it may just be growing pains as I was about 14 at the time. The next problem was where it really started to get much worse. About a year ago while showering I noticed a light brown spot which was probably just a stain or dirt of some sort on my foot sole. I could not stop thinking about this and was constantly measuring and photographing the spot to make sure it didnt grow. I couldnt help but to think this was melanoma. The dot eventually disappeared on its own after about 23 weeks. Next came issues of tingling in feet and hands. Being like I am I did the worst thing you could probably do which was google it. Of course it is a symptom of diabetes. I now constantly feel what I believe to be different symptoms happening each day. Each symptom I hear of miraculously occurs the next day. In fact I feel as if my vision is becoming blurred another symptom of diabetes as I type this. I know these symptoms appearing just after I learn of them is just my mind messing with me. Does anyone have any advice on how they were able to cope with these underlying thoughts? ,Anxiety

35031,35035,I don't know what to do Ever since I got a stomach bug in september I've had SIGNIFICANT problems with not just my stomach but everywhere. It started where I felt no appetite and gagged at the thought of food along with a really bad taste in my mouthrough feeling all throughout my mouth. That's where the problems began. After the days that followed I had HORRIBLE stomach problems nausea and diarrhea. That lasted a few days before kind of subsiding. After it let I had a sitting feeling in my body that something is very wrong. I had weird cold symptoms and a sick feeling that I was an still am unable to describe. That lasted another week so I thought okay it all must be over now surely right?This is where the real problems began. The stomach problems came back in full force after a long period of having a gurgling feeling in my stomach and intestines. This is about a couple weeks after the first stomach bug so I imagine fairs fair people can have stomach bugs that come back for another round. That left and I was left with a near constant rumbling feeling in my intestines so I start to imagine it's IBS. Real problems began when I started feeling feverish every few nights and my sex drive greatly increased for some reason I can't explain before giving way to more horrible stomach problems and diarrhea again. Now finally for the past month I've felt my mental state worsening and I'm starting to worry that I have bipolar due to me feeling tired and unable to do anything every few days then a cycle of feeling overly happy and my sex drive increasing. But something that I'm unable to reconcile with the bipolar theory is that at the end of it it's often accompanied by very real physical symptoms. This is turning into me rambling but my problems have become so bizarre yet serious that I'm unable to relate to other people's simple health anxiety where they worry about cancer or something easy to identify as a problem by themselves. I don't even know what I'm meant to worry about here. All I know is I feel awful reccuring stomach problems that are somehow accompanied by me feeling like I'm losing my mind when they begin. I'm so frustrated that it's become so hard to articulate my specific yet horrible problems.,Anxiety
35032,35036,First time questions and help Sorry if I mess this up its my first time posting on reddit and I need help.A little bit of background When I was 16 I had a seizure caused by a perforated eardrum I was on a life support for two days.Following my seizure I sort of got depressed and ended up putting on a lot of weight and never socialised with friends only on games I honestly left my house about 40 times in 6 years.Five years ago my dad had a heart attack which left him on all sorts of medications and has a lasting effect on his heart.In January 2017 my mum got diagnosed with oesophageal cancer they said they caught it early and she would survive but by the time march came she had gone from 55kg to 15kg all of the time me and my father was caring for her and watching her deteriorate. She died in the living room looking like which I can only describe as the worst thing Ive ever seen other members of the family who was there said theyve seen multiple people die of that horrible disease and my mums was the worst.After my mum died I took over full time carer of my brother who had quadriplegic cerebral palsy epilepsy severe scoliosis a collapsed lung and can not communicate.In 2018 around November I noticed a small lump on one of my testicles which caused me to be concerned and worry about it a lot this was later cleared up by an ultrasound to be nothing thankfully.Ive been doing fine but recently over christmas an incident happened which I think may have broken? Me mentally. I know this seems trivial but I wanted a peaceful Christmas but my father invited my sister and her family for Christmas dinner and said he would cook on Christmas Eve he says hes not cooking so I begin to panic I stayed up all night cooking meats and making sure everything was perfect for when they arrived. When dinner was just about ready to be served I got the potatoes off the stove and went to empty the water now this thing was pretty heavy and I needed a hand to drain it correctly I asked my sister to hold the lid so I could tilt the pan to drain. She said ok and I began to tilt the pan the lid cane flying off and all the potatoes went down the drain and was ruined. I can honestly say Ive never felt anything like that moment in my life it felt like I stood still for an hour but in reality it was five seconds while my brain tried to process what the fuck just happened. Then it settled and I just lost it I began crying and punching doors then went in to the room with my brother and just kept crying. For me as silly as it sounded Christmas was ruined I was down for like three or four days until I recovered mentally.Then on New Years Eve my father had too much to drink and basically collapsed and smashed his head on to the floor I thought he was dead as he wasnt breathing for a solid 40 seconds and didnt wake up for ten minutes.Then January came and I had some sort of panic attack in which I couldnt breathe and it felt like my brain was frozen. Ambulance came did tests and said everything was fine I just thought I had a flu or something. Since then Ive been in to hospital four times all of the time all the tests came back clear apart from an ecg which indicated there may be a slight problem. Doctor said he was 90 happy for me to go home and asked me do I have stress at home which I then told him about my mum etc and then he put it down to stress anxiety.My height is 6 ft 1 and 145kg really fatSince going to the hospital I cant stop thinking I have something wrong with me every little thing I google comes up with cancer or some sort of brain disease I had heartburn recently so the doctor prescribed me omezaproleprose to combat it as well as setralineZoloft or my anxiety. Ive had what can only be described as the rattles and havent felt like eating at all which is making me feel worse than ever. Does anyone have these symptoms?Whole body shakes and feels coldA cough that bring up phlegm sometimes Back pain and rib pain Cold hands and feet Trouble sleeping ConstipationWhen I breathe it feels like Im wheezing or my stomach is gurglingHonestly Im at wits end and my doctor keeps saying nothing is wrong just wanted a bit of insight to some of you anxiety veterans.Im also really scared to take setraline as the side effects look horrendous. Thanks guys !,Anxiety
35037,35041,Fitbit heart monitor is terrible for my health anxiety. I had a panic attack in Oct. It lasted for 12 hours. I ended up in the emergency room. Had blood work ECG and chest xray. Everything came back good. In fact I wasn't even worried I could have a heart condition until I was checked for it. After that I was convinced something was wrong with my brain. I thought I had a brain tumor stroke etc. After a while I calmed down on that still going to see a neurologist though because I suffer from a swaying dizziness when I'm anxious.Now I'm obsessed about my heart. I got a fitbit for my birthday and I religiously check my heart rate all day long. Checking it makes it spike. If I'm resting I can usually get it down to the 60s but if I keep checking it it spikes up in the 90s. When walking around it ranges from had palpitations typing this 110140 depending on how anxious I am. If I don't look at it it goes down if I do man oh man does it rise. During a panic attack it was 150. I sat down and calmed myself down and it dropped to 100. Blahhhhh.,Anxiety

I still felt like I needed to get checked for this so I went dr had ordered a lumbar spine mri and come to find out they did the quick results where they tell em what was wrong until my dr calls or I go in to go over the results more in detail and of course I have a bulging disc in my back as well as arthritis If youve had one done what reason did you have the test for and did they actually diagnose you with what you thought you had or was it something different you werent expecting or did they just say it was probably just anxiety and nothing was actually wrong?,Anxiety
35055,35059,The third appointment in a row where I have not been examined So I am well known to my gp practice recently due to a lot of issues with depression and anxiety. Long story short I wasn't fit to work and was very much suffering on the antidepressant that I had been put on. I was suicidal and close to the edge having panic attacks on the daily etc. I have since come off the antidepressant and it has been thw best decision I have ever made for myself. The anxiety is still there and always has been and I suspect always will be but I am functional again I couldn't even open my work email or answer an unexpected knock on the door without risking a panic attack and now I'm back at work.In the last month I have been experiencing intermittent stabbing shooting pains. I have a history of chronic muscle tightness and pain. I am currently in physio for trapezius and neck pain I also have midback tightness. I have previously had my legs in casts and afterwards splints to manipulate my calves into the correct position. I know what a muscle cramp feels like. I know what a pulled muscle feels like. I know what a muscle spasm feels like. I know what DOMs feels like. This new pain is on another level and it is vastly different in nature. I can't sleep I can't lie comfortably I can't concentrate properly I will involuntarily have to change position and grab the effected limb when the pain comes on.The pains that I am experiencing are not in the usual suspects of my calves or backneck but in my groinarmpitsideback of my thigh and glute areaankleelbow. My Google history is looking pretty crazy as a result. I have seen three different doctors at my gp practice about this because I am extremely distressed. Not one of them has examined me. All that has happened is that I have been counselled about psychosomatic symptoms being a thing and encouraged to get back on antidepressants. I feel like nobody is taking me seriously and this being the UK GPs are very much the gatekeepers to other services. While I would be willing to pay for answers if it comes to it I wouldn't even know where to start because I have no idea what could be causing all this. I'm crying as I'm typing right now from a stabbing pain in my groin. I just cannot believe that it's all in my head when my mental health is so much better now than it was. ,Anxiety
35072,35075,Am i a hypochondriac? I am a 24 year old female and would like to preface this by saying that I do actually have a few chronic illnesses that have been diagnosed one of which is an autoimmune deficiency. As well as severe anxiety with frequent panic attacks. That being said for years now I have been hyper focused on various symptoms my body has displayed that usually end with them disappearing and me forgetting they ever happened. But with every pain or nausea episode I have I end up spending hours googling symptoms and what they mean. For years now I have put in anywhere from 28 hours a day on various medical websites. This week alone I have convinced myself that I haveibsCrohn'sbreast cancerkidney failurepregnacykidney stonespatellafemoral syndromewormsdiabetic ketoacidosisan impending heart attackI am tired of being scared all the time. I am aware this isn't normal and I haven't even considered that I was a hypochondriac until today. Could that be the cause of these irrational worries? ,Anxiety

35105,35107,Weird sensations in head headaches 28MWhite320lbs Blood pressure good 11881 currently dieting and losing weight steadily uncontrolled anxietydepression caused lots of weight gain Currently taking Zoloft 75mg and Metaprolol 12mg half a tablet twice a day as well as magnesium supplements and vitamin b12 supplements.Been suffering with weird sensations in my head since December 11th. Started off getting very mild headaches with pressure in my right temple. Went to Urgent care they ordered a CT scan without contrast which all came back normal. I do suffer from high Anxiety and depression which is why I take Zoloft. The headaches have always been mild and the pressure has never really been severe it just kinda scares me. Doctor put me on metaprolol because he thinks it may be migraines as I also get some auras black dots and what not. The pain also seems to get worse when I lay on my right side that's when the pressure is at its highest. My doctor honestly doesn't seem too worried about it and thinks it's migraines but I don't see why migraines would give me the head pressure. I think it's getting better but it is definitely still there. A couple things I have very outdated glasses and really need a new prescription I also notice lately that I think I'm a pretty bad jaw clincher without realizing it. I might be forgetting some details but one other strange thing is I feel like it was less painful and obvious if I wore a hat but then I wasn't sure if it was caused from hearing a hat beanie so I stopped wearing that. Sorry if this is confusing hopefully someone else has experienced this and may be able to help.,Anxiety

I have always had problems with my stomach docs gastroscopied me in 2016 because I had nausea and heartburn almost 247. Biopsies and everything came back normal never gotten colonoscopied though. In my mind these canker sores are a symptom of crohns disease and it must mean I have it. I just can't figure out any other explanation than that thanks to hypochondria. My stomach problems were pretty bad years ago and I thought I had colon cancer or something like that. Nowadays I feel a lot better but the thing is that if something comes up that might be a symptom of IBDCrohnsColon cancer I almost instantly think I have it.,Anxiety

35210,35210,Going out on a limb here anyone else have benign brain calcification? I used to work at a cancer hospital and had severe health anxiety about brain tumors. I went to several doctors all of which said I was healthy. I finally worked up the courage to go to a neurologist and upon seeing how anxious I was she gave me a brain MRI. It turns out that I had an incidental finding which was benign brain calcification. She said it is unremarkable and the rest was deemed normal. I had another CT a year later and the size was unchanged. So that could indicate Ive just had it my whole life and means nothing and they pushed the next CT to 5 years away which would be next year or the year after. They did say that if Im having symptoms such as a headache they gave no other symptoms that we can schedule it sooner. Im just terrified that its multiplying in my brain right now or something. I have terrible health anxiety and get horrible symptoms especially with vision. Im just nervous that its the calcification causing this and not my anxiety. Has anyone else had experience with this? Or any doctors that can give me some reassurance? I know I should just make an appointment with the neurologist but she already thinks Im crazy and told me to see a psychologist about my anxiety which I do lol. Thanks on advance! ,Anxiety

I asked my doctor about it and he asked if I wanted a 48hour holter monitor just to be sure. Of course I said yes.The nurse who put the monitor on me said a lot of very terrifying things about how rare it is for her to see a monitor come back with normal results. She was a real Debbie Downer and it did not help my anxiety about this whole thing. So I figured I would ask y'all have you ever had a holter monitor that came back with good results?,Anxiety

35303,35302,Ive been managing my health anxiety pretty well! .....until today So Im on 150mg of Zoloft daily along with Lamictal not certain about the dosage. Today I was taking my daily pills but I accidentally took an extra pill which I guess would mean I took 250mg. My mom called the pharmacist who said I should be fine but to look out for fainting. Ironically I felt lightheaded just seconds after realizing Id taken more than the prescribed dose. So Im guessing that was anxiety because no pill affects you that fast as far as Im aware.But technically it still is an overdose but a small one. Whenever I drink water it feels weird on my throat and theres a tickle in my throat though that could be a mix of allergies and anxiety. And when I got up at first I felt dizzy.I looked it up and it says that 200mg is usually the max dosage. I took 50mg more. Im afraid to sleep or anything. This happened around 5 hours ago. If Id overdosed on a fatal level would I have exhibited severe and obvious symptoms by now? Im just so paranoid now ,Anxiety
35311,35310,So annoyed with myself...health anxiety resurgence Hey guysSo annoyed with myself even though I guess it isnt really my fault I used to have pretty bad health anxiety a few years ago. It started to subside somewhat after I got a scan done after I felt a lump it was just a cyst. Right around that time I was also immigrating from the UK to the US so my life got super busy and the health anxiety virtually went away. Ive been in the US for almost two years now and havent really had any big health worries since I got the scan done in England years ago...until this week. My wife passed onto me I guess some sort of virus and I had flu like symptoms of course a lymph node on my neck has swollen as is pretty topical with stuff like that and Im now convinced I have lymphoma. 0 to 60 in about a week unbelievable. This time feels different though when this sort of stuff happened in the past my rational thought was completely obscured to the point where any logical or rational thought would immediately be dismissed in favor of the worst case scenario but this time Im well aware how irrational Im being and Im well aware that its most likely just due to this infection. But Im still worrying. I made the mistake of Googling it and although Google does say that with cancerous lumps in the neck theyre typically immovable mine is movable Im still panicking!,Anxiety
35325,35324,Worried about my health hi so my health anxiety is through the roof. since january every week has been different first one was my period second was i thought i had cervical cancer the second was breast cancer the other was a brain tumour and now its breast cancer again. i keep checking my nipple as i think there is a lump on it or crusty but i know its not as every other time i have looked the past month i didn't see anything stand out so i don't know if it is because my brain wants something new to worry about. i am waking up with panic attacks and crying. i just hate it.,Anxiety
35336,35334,Lumps on neck and head now. Okay so first of all thank you for reading this I am struggling with bad anxiety right now. I have had two lumps on the side of my neck for 2 years now and have been told in the past by a doctor that they were nothing. I was put on antibiotics which didn't seem to help and sent away. I recently had them checked out again and the doctor ordered an ultrasound which I have yet to go to to make sure they weren't cancer. I have zero symptoms otherwise. Fast forward to now I have a larger lump on the back left side of my scalp. I'm trying to tell myself it's just a cyst but the anxious pattern seeking side of me is having a hard time time letting it go. It's larger than the other two and is hard and hurts a little when I apply pressure. There are a few causes I can think of It's just a cyst and completely unrelated to my other two swollen lymph nodes. My fathet has a history of cysts which may account for mine.I'm pretty sure I remember hitting my head on something about a week ago so it could just be a bruise of sorts. memory isn't clearCancer. I'm gonna die hit the panic button ect...I recently have been having allergies or a cold which could be due to an infection which could be making my lymph nodes react. This is the way my anxious mind sees it I must have cancer because there is now a third lump to add on the other two I've had for years. I've left it untreated for so long that I'm scared to even go to a doctor. Now it must be spreading to my brain which would probably make it inoperable. I will get brain cancer and die at 19 due to my lack of action.I'm honestly having trouble deciphering hypochondria from reality.I'm hoping someone besides myself could make a determination as to whether or not I'm blowing this out of proportion. Thank you.I'm also worried that in trying to niaevely make myself feel better by posting this. ,Anxiety
35348,35346,I dont understand why my sickness wont go away. Im starting to think I might have neck or throat cancer. Two months ago I went to the doctor due to a cough and a caught up stuffy head Ive had for literally 23 months straight. The doctor gave me decongestants and antibiotics to tackle infections. 1 month later I still have the cough and I developed really bad mouth ulcers which made it extremely difficult to eat or even talk along with a lump developing under my jaw which was supposedly a swollen lymph node. I got a blood test taken. I also had constant tiredness. I got acid reflux then in between all of this which I also got medicine for. Its cured now.I got prescribed medicine again and I got rid of the ulcers and the soreness in my mouth. The lump under my jaw disappeared and my blood tests said I was perfectly fine but I still dont feel right. Another lump has just grown on the right side of my neck this time and my cough and stuffy head is STILL effecting me. Im really starting to worry that this might be something very serious. Why cant I just become fully healthy? Its been months almost 4 months now. Im going back to the doc again on Friday and this time Im going to tell her my concerns. ,Anxiety

35372,35369,Oh boy a swollen lymph node. I spent five years absolutely convinced my ibs was a sign of some horrible bowel cancer. Kept putting off any screening colonoscopy for fear of the procedure and for fear Id be right. Finally got it done and woo nothings wrong! Turns out my anxiety was actually 90 of the cause behind horrible intestinal upset for yeaaars. So that subsides finally and I can get back to normal. Til now. About a week ago I discovered a swollen what I presume to be a lymph node on my upper thighgroin crease area. About the size of a grape hard and moveable. Doesnt hurt until I start messing with it.

35405,35401,Afraid of hospital infection Well I do not want to rationalize my fear of hospital infection however if we look at the stats hospital infection rates are significantly higher than before. I will have an arthroscopic knee debridement surgery the procedure just needs two 48 mm incisions basically. Usually patient would be discharged after a few hours of waking up or stay one night at hospital in some cases. I know in every surgery there is a chance of infection and I know that my surgery is one of the easiest surgeries available too. However I am really afraid to get an hospital infection. I had 4 surgeries before but the nearest one was 7 years ago when I was 17 years old. I am almost 5 inches taller64' and 100 pounds heavier now300lbs currently. I mean when we put all those things together these make me anxious. To sum upI am really scared of hospital infection even though my surgery is pretty easy and incisions will be just 8 mm max.I am slightly afraid of anesthesia since my body changed a lot in last 7 years.What are your thoughts? Thank you guys!Have a great sunday! ,Anxiety
35420,35416,I can't remember a day when I wasn't worried about dying... Hi allI'm a 26yo male that's been suffering from health anxiety for pretty much ever it seems. I've run the gauntlet of tests doctor visits and scans with my results always coming back negative yet I'm never satisfied. I always have this sneaking suspicion I'm the 0.1 that is sick and doctors cannot diagnose.For the past 2.5 years I've had a swollen lymph node 1cm on the side of my neck and lower on my neck I can feel multiple squishy tinier lymph nodes. I've had ultrasounds many times and even a biopsy for a swollen node in my groin that came back negative for anything strange. Today I found a swelling in my armpit and now I'm in crisis mode once again.Every day with this feels like a battle I must constantly convince myself that I'm healthy when deep down part of me believes I'm not. Every time I think I've made progress it all comes rushing back in like the tide and I'm completely derailed again. I'm so fed up with this and it's clearly no way to live. I never think about the future at all because I can't picture lasting long enough to have a future.I know this is kind of a rambling wall of text I just needed to get this out somewhere because everyone I talk to in my personal life just tells me what to do to feel better. To change my thoughts to eat healthier to be more active yet when these thoughts occur it's like I'm completely overwhelmed and I don't feel like I have a choice.I guess that's it.,Anxiety
35423,35419,How many of you have been triggered by lymph nodes? So I have lived most of my life with anxiety always taking new faces. On december my uncle died of ALS and shit was rough part because he was an amazing uncle and part because that illness is awful. Ever since then I have been suffering health anxiety and just now I am realizing that's what I am feeling. In this time I have been convinced that I have ALS because fuck yeah I do have all the symptoms. I have a tumor on my head my long time sinuses problems are caused by it also as any other new gen kid my sight has develop some wear and my right eye has astigmatism and myopia which is normal. Last but not least I have been touching my lymph nodes for fucking 2 months and they don't go away which my ENT already said was a normal stuff for me. Just now I realized maybe lymph nodes are never that small that if you push hard on your skin they won't be felt it's said a lymph node with a 1 cm diameter is normal. So I have been probably just pushing real hard on my neck that I always find them swollen.,Anxiety
35425,35421,Read this if youre under 35 and worried about pancreatic cancer. Figured this might be useful info with the news of Alex Trebek 78 years old.Stats Canada From 2011 to 2013 new cases identified prior to the age of 35 were diagnosed at a rate of 0.2 per 100000 persons.Thats a 0.0002 chance... considerably less than getting killed by lightning 0.0006.I actually managed to convince myself I had this condition I spent too much time researching symptoms and not looking at the actual statistics.

35432,35428,Waiting for fine needle aspiration results I had a fine needle aspiration on a lymph node on my neck 2 weeks ago I just got a letter through the post about a consultation in a month so waiting 6 weeks in total for results.I rang the hospital and gave my information and they asked the Ent secretary who said they won't give me my results over the phone. I also have severe anxiety so waiting 6 weeks well after 2 I'm already going kind of insane about it I'd rather know if there is something wrong or not and be able to prepare myself instead of being in a state of limbo... Anyone else had to wait until their appointment to find out results? Were they good or bad? Just so I know if there is a chance I'll be fine. I guess this is also venting my frustration of waiting along with asking for advice... ,Anxiety

35454,35450,Convinced I have MS Hey. I can't seem to calm myself down right now... I've completely convinced myself I have MS.. my HA has been seriously terrible lately. I keep having panic attacks and I have embarrassingly broken down several times this past week at work. This post is long I'm very sorry.I'm a 21 yo female. I've had health anxiety for nearly all my life. For the past few months I've had pain through my left buttock and leg. Went to Dr who said it was pinched sciatic nerve which completely makes sense my dad has also had the same problem and it sounds exactly like what I have anyway I still obsessed over it being a blood clot or something serious. Sometimes when I am very stressed my arms tend to go weak and I shake. I also will feel numb in certain areas of my body. Recently though the area around the left side of my mouth has felt weaknumb when I'm anxious. I always check in the mirror and it's not drooping or anything. It makes my anxiety go through the roof. I also am very aware of my speaking when this happens and I sometimes feel as if I slur my words. It never lasts very long and usually if I take anxiety medication it goes away fairly quick. However when googling this I know I can't keep googling things like the first result is MS.. I can't shake it... Here are my other symptoms...very tired. I did just start on two anxiety medications so I'm trying to attribute my tiredness to that.I'm constantly tense. My jaw is nearly always tight and my shoulders are always up to my ears.tight chestfeels like I'm short of breath frequently. I think I'm like.. slightly hyperventilating at all times.frequent nausea. blurry vision especially at night or after looking at my phone for a long time having it now unfortunatelyfeeling disconnecteddizzy when I'm extremely anxiousi get very itchy on my thighs and on my arms. This has happened all my life. Usually if I'm wearing warm clothes under a blanket or I've just taken a hot shower I've always had this and assumed dry skin but I learned that sometimes MS can cause hot itchiness that is often mirrored on the body even worse I noticed yesterday that in the places I've scratched really hard I've even left small bruises and a few scratches.for as long as I can remember I've had this thing where if I'm laughing really hard I lose my grip can't hold a pencil or something idk it's weirdwhen I'm anxious sometimes when I'm not my hands shakeive always been pretty strong but for as long as I can remember my arms shake like if I'm pouring a pitcher of water or something.i have also had excema on my hands for the last few years Dr said due to stress and excessive hand washing which lines up but it did start out mirroredI watched a video yesterday of a man who had been hardcore dealing with MS fears who went to the doctor and he was fine and all. He listed a few of his symptoms a lot of which I shared. He also mentioned very weak muscles and twitching along with pins and needles in his limbs. I was thankful I hadn't really had any of that. But seriously just a few hours later all these symptoms hit. Even worse today. My hands have been jittery the whole time I've typed this.. I know there are more symptoms. I'm sorry this post is a mess. I'm seriously so scared. Lately all I can think about is my health. I'm finding it hard to do basic tasks and function normally. I'm sorry that this was so long. I just wondered if anyone else deals with this.,Anxiety

35460,35456,Freaking Out and Anxious Please send good vibes I just turned 18 and so far this year has sucked. During my two month break from university I got heart palpitations for the first time in my life. That led to a google fest for me. I thought it was over the next day and was ready to just move on when I got really bad stomach aches and chest pain. I went to the ER and they said I was fine. I decided to take a break from school to talk with my GP and he said I just had anxiety. Its been 2 months since then and while the stomach problems have mostly dissipated I have started to notice random twitching all over my body along with headaches and some numbness in my middle finger. Today my left arm feels weak and sore. I am going to see my GP in a week but I am anxious. I feel like the boy who cried wolf at this point while I feel like something is wrong sometimes I feel unable to explain it properly. I'm trying not to actively thinking about these symptoms because I know anxiety has many effects but it I just can't rationalize that these symptoms are normal. I'm just holding on to the fact that there have been too many random symptoms within such a short amount of time for it too be some terrible illness.,Anxiety

35487,35483,Vision oddities Hey all just wanted to ask if anyone had any similar experiences to myself. A few months ago I 25 had my first panic attack that sent me to the ER. EKG came out perfect sent me home. Soon after I started getting more and more panic and anxiety symptoms at an increasing rate. Started diagnosing myself foolishly with all kinds of different things from heart problems a ministroke MS brain tumor the works. Went from 0 to hypochondriac in weeks. Went to my doctor and got some tests for thyroid and such all fine. My BP is slightly high at 13582 as well.Most of the symptoms of everything has gone away except my vision. I woke up one morning about 67 days ago with.. not what I would call blurry vision but almost an otherworldly filter applied to it. Nothing is any more difficult to read no flashing no pain no color changes but things are just hard to look at and I've got a bit of tunnel vision going on. I've always had floaters in my vision and there aren't any new ones but the floaters themselves are kinda blurry now and I notice them everywhere instead of just outside.Could it just be eye strain from being in a constant state of stress for a month straight with poor sleep quality? I'm not asking for a diagnosis obviously but I want to know if this is a shared experience from anyone else.,Anxiety
35499,35494,Worried I have ovarian cancer. The more I'm on social media the more I hear about 'silent killer' cancers. I read that a common symptom of ovarian cancer is being bloated and feeling full quickly. I feel full a lot and never really finish my plate and I often have a bloated stomach. I pee pretty frequently too. I just feel so stupid going to a doctor with these sort of symptoms. I also have a fear that a doctor will wrongly say that I'm fine and then I'll be all relax while the cancer spreads inside me. There's so many different types of illnesses to consider and be at risk of. It drives me insane. ,Anxiety
35500,35495,Im convinced I have a urethral stricture In may of last year I had a type of explosion in my bladder. It came with an insane feeling of urgency frequency and a feeling that myBladder was in the grip of a vice. I also had an electrical type feeling in my bladder and Perineum.I saw a urologist who thought I had a urethral stricture. I was sent for a cystoscopy that showed everything was ok. That was in September 2018. 3 months later the urgency and frequency decreased but then what accompanied was pelvic pain tailbone pain I had to start sitting down to urinate and I had to start milking my urethra to empty it at this time I was also tapering from 6mgs of clonazepam. I hit 2mgs when this started. I finished my taper on clonazepam in the middle of February.I now have all of those symptoms but theyre at full force now. For the past two weeks I had a slight burn at the end of urination. Peeing didnt hurt but at the end I had a sharpburn pain in a specific area in the top of my penisurethra. For the past two weeks Ive had a feeling that theres a marble stuck in my urethra. Sometimes I can feel pressure in my urethra when I move about. Sometimes I get a sharp stabbing pain down my urethra too. The side of my penis hurts too. IAlso have to gently milk my urethra to get the rest of the urine out. My fear is that the cystoscopy has caused a stricture. Its done the very thing that it was supposed to rule out. There was no blood after it was done nor did it burn when I peed but the tip of my penis was very swollen for anHour or so. Apparently its extremely rare for someone to get a stricture from a routine cystoscopy especially in the area I think mine is. But Im 100 convinced that I have one. Its making me very ill. I see the urologist in 5 days time. Im in a chronic pelvic pain support group and apparently this is a very common symptom. But other guys have the same symptoms and have a stricture. I dont want another cystoscopy but Im guessing Ill have to have one as its the only way to treat a stricture. I cant believe Im in this mess. Im so upset and frustrated. ,Anxiety

35542,35537,Thyroid cancer? Lymphoma? Random infection? I'm a 21 year old male. 20 days ago I started feeling pain in the lower right part of my throat right above my collarbone. Halfway through the week I noticed a lump was there and made an appointment with my doctor. Doctor sent me for an ultrasound and found a 3cm lump in my neck but couldn't make out what exactly it was so I was sent for a CT scan. The CT scan results showed that this tumor was near a muscle and lymph node. It looked suspicious to her and she also saw 2 other minor swollen lymph nodes so she referred me to a much better hospital Vanderbilt so that they could do their own tests. That was 12 days ago. This past Friday I had a fine needle biopsy done on the lump and got the results back yesterday. Apparently cancer wasn't detected and bacteria wasn't either but I did see something about 2 polys. The test was essentially inconclusive but whatever it was it looked infectious and something on the uncommon side according to my doctor. My doctor was going to prescribe me Augmentin but since I am allergic I was prescribed Clindamycin. He wants to try me on that for a week and see if it helps. However the day after the biopsy was done I have started experiencing slight pain right under my adam's apple when I yawn or look down. Seems like there is a bump there too. I let my doctor know this yesterday but he still wants to go through with the antibiotic for a week to see if anything changes. I don't really notice any other symptoms. I think my mouth has been a bit more dry as of late but nothing crazy. I was pretty worried early on but started to get over it until this other lump showed up. Wouldn't the CT scan from just over a week ago detected this new lump? I feel like I should be relieved that they didn't find anything malignant but I'm also worried that maybe they missed it or didn't get a proper reading. I have all the trust in the world in this hospital but my nerves are getting the best of me. Sorry if this is kind of all over the place. ,Anxiety

It's not painful enough to disrupt my day but it's a little disconcerting. I started googling and I saw a bunch of people who had this and it just went away on its own or it wasn't anything but then of course I continued googling and back pain can be cancer.

35662,35657,i cant tell if its all in my head or not and its trying me crazy New around here but Im so glad this sub exists since I know I tend to be very aware of my health. Sorry about the length. TLDR at the end. Four years ago I started to develop occasional constipation. It was nothing a little dried fruit couldnt solve and it only happened every so often. So far so good.Then it all started going downhill after I had a kidney stone when I was 17. Ever since then Ive been struggling with constipation daily. Since diet change wasnt helping I went to my moms GI doc and had my first colonoscopy at 17. Fun. The test came back clear and the GI sent me home with directions to take Miralax daily. Fast forward a year no change. Miralax helps but it was like going from hard stool constipation to soft stool constipation. Went back to GI where I was diagnosed with IBSC with no further testing and given a prescription of Linzess. Two years go by still no change. Linzess works but not as well as it used to. Not only that but I was now dealing with worse symptoms and felt as if my guts just werent moving. I was still have a bowel movements almost daily but it was never without a laxative of some sort. I tried the lowFODMAP without much change either. I did eliminate dairy and gluten from my diet cleared a ton of my acne once I did that.I decide to get a second opinion. Saw a different GI. He suggests a blood test and does an endoscopy. Ended up getting diagnosed with GERD and chronic gastritis. Also he found food still in my stomach despite not eating anything 13 hours beforehand. GI sends me to get a gastric emptying study done. That test ended up turning out normal too. Blood test was also normal besides for a low of lymphocytes and a low number for buncreatine. Neither of those were that much lower than the normal range. All and all I was given a clean bill of health.But if these tests are coming back normal besides the GERD and chronic gastritis then why am I still having symptoms? Why is it getting worse over the years? It was just constipation at first which Im sure is just affects your colon. So why am I having upper GI issues now? I constantly deal with regurgitation constipation nausea cramping slow moving bowels gas bloating low grade fevers etc. I cant even do exercise without throwing up. I used to swim varsity in high school and now I cant swim an entire 50 yards without running out of the pool. Doesnt matter when I eat or what time of day it is. At first dried fruit did the trick but when things get real bad not even an enema or magnesium citrate work. But on other days they do. Why it is that when I try to talk to a doctor about it they dont listen? Is it because Im only 20? Even my parents are sick of me constantly feeling ill especially on vacations. Ive been diagnosed with depression anxiety and ADHD but wasnt given any medications until last year so I know it didnt start because of medication. What if it really is all in my head? What if Im just doing this to myself by stressing over it? Im transferring from community college to university this fall. What if I cant do it and have to go home? Whos gonna believe me if these tests just come back normal? But I just know something is wrong. Why else would I still have these issues if everything was okay?Im going to a gastroenterology motility clinic at Stanford at the end of April to get one last opinion. I just feel like Im wasting so much money. Im probably the only person that wants a diagnoses at this point. I just want answers. But at the same time what if the results were right and there is nothing wrong? I dunno. I just have so much anxiety now around food and eatingshitting in general. It wasnt like this last year until things slowly started to get worse. TLDR Been having bowelstomach issues for years. GI doctors slap on IBS diagnoses but Im worried its something worse due to worsening symptoms over the years. But also worried that there really is nothing wrong and that the stressanxiety was it all along. Stressed about wasting money on pointless tests thatll all come back normal even though every day is a struggle. ,Anxiety
35664,35659,Do you ever find your symptoms change or transfer to different areas? A couple of months ago I started getting this sharp pain in my upper right abdomen just below the ribcage. I'm 27 and regrettably eat a fair amount of takeout so naturally I assumed this to be gallbladder issues. I ended up getting it checked at the ER one night when I got some really sharp pains and found a bump in that area. The doctor was convinced the bump was just fatty cartilage and since the pains seemed to happen at random and not after meals that it was likely not my gallbladder. They scheduled an ultrasound anyway which turned up with no issues which I was happy about.ampx200BThat said since then I started getting neckback pain which didn't really concern me given my crappy posture and I've always had a fair amount of neck tension. However in the past couple weeks I started getting random shoulderarm pains that come just as quick as they go and today i started getting quick sharp chest pains though I'm convinced the chest issue comes from some recreational smoking last night with some friends.ampx200BAnyways thinking about all this made me wonder if many other people here have dealt with anything similar and honestly typing this all out has helped me deal with some of the anxiety which is a welcome bit of relief.,Anxiety
35684,35679,I recently remembered multiple sclerosis exists A few weeks ago I felt a weird pulsating sharp pain in the back of my head I promised myself I wouldn't google it but by the end of the day I just couldn't let go. So I googled it and worried for days I had occipital neuralgia but it went away and then I remember the next suggested disease multiple sclerosis. And now I just conviced myself all the weird symptoms I had and went to the doctor only to be told I'm completely fine must be because of MS. Like the times I thought I was having a heart attack because of pain in my left arm or when I thought I had a detached retina because my eyes felt weird and I thought I saw flashing lights. When I focus on something really close to my eyes and then focus on something far and feel a little desoriented etc etc etc. It must all be neurological after all!And now I feel all these things again and I keep thinking what if it isn't psychosomatic.

I actually have had some health scares and I think it's triggering it beyond belief. I think it's actually causing the aches and pains. I'm at the point where I'm 500 sure I have colon cancer and ALS and cervixovarian cancer and an undiagnosed heart issue. Now my kidneys hurt? So naturally my cancer has spread. It's been like this for a year and my only relief has been when seasonal depression hits.I'm getting married soon. I have a good job. I have lots to look forward to but I'm so so sure I won't be around to see it. I need help and no one takes me seriously. My doctor doesn't understand that this iya ruining my life and keeps giving me meds. With side effects. To someone with health anxiety. I've taken like six different types and none help at all. I can only afford 4 sessions of therapy per year and have found them mostly useless.There has to be something. I can do. I'm so sure I'm going to die and I'm fucking terrified.,Anxiety
35721,35716,Convinced I have MRI contrast dye poisoning weeks after a brain MRI. Need help coping. Using a somewhat new throwaway account sorry if my karma is low. I'm sort of new to the realization that I have HA but it all makes sense now. I've always had anxiety but it's definitely evolved into this about 6 months ago.A few months back I had some strange symptoms that were related to jaw pain. I've pretty much figured out what's wrong there but because of that I've seen a slew of doctors including a neurologist. My doctor ordered a brain MRI with contrast just to be safe. I stupidly googled if the contrast dye can cause adverse reactions in people I strongly suggest you don't google it. Anyway after the MRI I felt nauseated which set my HA into a tailspin. Now a few weeks later I'm noticing that my feet hands and legs suddenly go cold especially when I'm sitting down. I'm talking freezing cold even if the rest of my body is warm. When they finally warm up I get pins and needles all down my legs and today I woke up with muscle spasms in my feet and legs. My scumbag brain is telling me I have some type of weird contrast dye poisoning that isn't curable you know how it goes.My feet getting freezing cold does happen when I'm not in what I would say would be a heightened state of anxiety. It usually sends me into a state of anxiety which I'm sure definitely doesn't help my extremities. It's a real chickenegg scenario.Does this sound like anxiety to anyone or should I actually be concerned? I mean I'm young just turned 30 I exercise about 4 or 5 times a week I eat pretty healthy and am all around healthy. In my mind this should not be happening but here I am. I'm also worried that if I go to the doctor and ask him to test to see if I still have the dye in my system he's going to think I'm crying wolf and won't take me seriously when something else is wrong.I definitely need the sage advice of other HA veterans. I'm new to this and don't know how to tell my brain to stop worrying about it. It won't and I feel out of control like I can't shut it off.,Anxiety
35749,35744,Scared Ive got cervical cancer Hiya. Ive been trying to keep my HA at bay been plagued by it for 15yrs almost now. Currently worrying I have cervical cancer and I cant check because I have vaginismus whenever I try to have smear tests. Ive had a lot going on since October last year and tried to seek answers from health professionals I say that so lightly and people on Reddit for advice. Ive had loads of symptoms since January that you can get with various stages of cervical cancer but I dont know if its based on basic stuff. Ive had around 5 blood tests stool samples ultrasounds of my ovaries in that time and two unsuccessful smear exams. Im super scared but apparently any changes could be picked up in bloodwork Ive been told by a semi professional my bfs mum is a GP so I try to ask him to get her opinions etc. Im so scared and keep googling cervical cancer and the signs. Tho Ive had swabs taken from just outside my cervix tho that wont detect any normalities. I just wanna be normal and not worry. This is the second cancer scare Ive put myself through since February ,Anxiety
35750,35745,I have a chest cold So of course I probably have cancer. And my head hurts a little so I'm sure I'm headed for an aneurysm. My back is sore from sleeping on a shitty mattress but it could be scoliosis. I peed more than usual today so of course my kidneys are in jeopardy. Ugh I am tired. So MS right? Anyway I am just annoyed at my thoughts and figured they needed to get out of my head. ,Anxiety
35771,35766,Started CBT therapy a few weeks ago Hi guys I started my course of CBT a few weeks back and one of the first steps my therapist has told me to take is to completely stop the excessive checking I do whether that be prodding for lumps if I feel a pain or taking tonnes of pictures of moles thinking theyve changed etc. The therapist was saying that there isnt really a magic formula to stop the checking you just have to do it cold turkey.I feel I have reduced it a fair bit since starting as I realised a lot of it was mindless but stuff like the checking of moles is still keeping me from stopping has anyone got any tips?Thanks,Anxiety
35786,35781,Can we try to avoid posting stories about other peoples health problems? I will open a thread amp there will be people saying my mom had this i went to school with a girl who had this happen to her etc. instead of reassuring me hearing anecdotes just triggers my HA. Or am i just being unreasonable amp sensitive..?,Anxiety
35787,35782,I don't wanna eat Trigger Warning I do not know if this is the right subreddit for this if its not then please redirect me to a proper subreddit.I do not think know if this counts as an eating disorder or not. I think about not eating sometimes although I have not acted upon it. The reason why I don't want to eat is because of my periods. If I don't eat I will not get my period. I have really bad anxiety when it comes to menstruation. This post I made explains why.httpswww.reddit.comrmenstruationcommentsaf32dwiwannatalkaboutmenophobiamystoryMy period is the main cause of my anxiety. I'm tired of being ashamed and embarrassed about this. I'm tired of being not like everyone else. I just don't want to put up this anymore. I'd like to add that I haven't started to starve myself these are just intrusive thoughts. Although I kinda want to stop eating.I'm not calling this an eating disorder is because it has nothing to do weight or body image. As you can see this is very complicated. If I do stop eating I'll take everything into consideration.The only way for me to be happy is without my period. I'll eat when I don't have my period that month or whatever.I want to try to conquer my fear of sexmenstruation. But I know I can't do it. People on Reddit say that I should try to learn about what's going on in body so that I won't be afraid. I definitely can't do that. I'm a loser because of this.I blame myself a lot for being this fear. Its all my fault. I hit myself from time to time because I feel so stupid. I have not told my family that I think about not eating anything. I feel too guilty to tell someone. People already don't understand why I feel uncomfortable about sexuality and menstruation. Life sucks.Again if this isn't the place for this let me know.,Anxiety
35791,35786,lived in Vermont apartment for over a year possibly with dangerous radon levels I'm a 28yearold male reasonably fit moved to Montpelier VT over a year ago. Yesterday at work I overheard two women talking about a tunnel that was cordoned off due to dangerously high radon levels. I did some research and apparently Montpelier is a death zone with abnormally high levels all across with the average being a whopping 3.4.I'm an introvert and spend a lot of time indoors horribly afraid of cancer and now I'm convinced I'm going to develop lung cancer. Haven't had the radon levels in my apartment checked and I can't afford a contractor to do the job right. I heard the free test kits require around nine months to get an accurate reading and I refuse to wait that long and potentially jeopardizing my health. I have a shitload of work to do and I can't concentrate. I don't feel safe in my house anymore. Is one year of exposure to potentially elevated radon levels enough to develop lung cancer?,Anxiety
35792,35787,How often do you guys bug your Docs? I feel like in the last 8 months or so I've been calling with new issues every couple weeks. I'm afraid I could be developing a reputation at the office. I'm trying to not be such a bug but my anxiety is high and I have legitimate concerns. I am about to call once again and thought maybe I would feel better about being such a bug if I hear that other people bug their docs as well. So how often are you guys buggin the docs?,Anxiety
35801,35796,How to stop the feedback loop? I finally got over my own health anxiety. There are many 'problems' I have that I don't really worry about anymore. yay.In exchange I am now worrying about the health of others like crazy. Some people in my life either have or died to cancer and right now I only have my mother left of my family. Not a day goes by where I am not building up a scenario in my head where she will die soon. It doesn't help that she is the type of person to never see a doctor so I spend every waking moment trying to find a way to make her get her appointments.The thing is I really want to stop somedays I tell myself how unlikely all of this is even looking up global statistics and that I should just stop and go on.But then it's my fault if she dies. That is all I ever think about. Because I didn't make her go so it wasn't found and I will never ever forgive myself that. So I go right back to 'I need to worry'.How the hell do you get around that thought?,Anxiety
35804,35799,Am I the only one who worries for everybody? I worry for myself and I worry for my bf for my friends familly...I can't get over the fact that at some point I will lose one of them and it's freaking me out. Every little symptoms is triggering hypochondria for others!!!,Anxiety
35815,35810,Can anyone help to calm me down? Im 22 year old male. Been trying to give up alcohol but drank the past 4 days due to social circumstances. Had a lot of drinks 20 yesterday over the course of the whole day and woke up feeling awful. I finally threw up less than an hour ago but there was some blood in it. Now I think Im going to die and just need a rational perspective to help calm me down. I had a doctor check up about a month ago where they said I checked out healthy but I have had no tests except an EKG when I went to the hospital for a panic attack about 2 months ago. Thanks again for any advice.,Anxiety
35824,35819,Please tell me if its something serious Two months ago I went through a bout of a bad common cold and it was gone late February. In March I was definitely fine. In April however I began to have runny nose coughing with phlegm on the first day but now its dry without a sore throat. It is really unusual for me to have a cold twice in two months and I think it might relate due to me having Rhabdomyolysis in 2017 and I think I might have either lung cancer throat cancer or leukemia... ,Anxiety
35825,35820,Failed driving test amp I think I have a terrible disease or cancer My health anxiety had gotten better but since February I thought I had lymphoma skin itching for no reason no rash which then turned to thinking I had ovarian or colon cancer constipationtenesmus heartburn and bloating. Then today I woke up feeling how you feel when you have the coldflu lots of fatigue body aches headache maybe slight fever not sure? Also my period started so Im feeling extra crappy. And to top it all off I failed my drivers test for the 2nd time. I have a doctors appointment tomorrow and I dont even know where to start. Or if I should just ask to be referred to a therapist. I guess i just needed to put it all into words. I just want to go to sleep and wake up somewhere different living a different life. My life is shitty for other reasons not posted here,Anxiety
35838,35833,Has anyone successfully learned to accept the possibility of a spontaneous death as a method of getting over health anxiety? I know this is weird but I had a meeting with my school's CBT counselor and she talked about how a good way to get over health anxiety is to just accept the fact that any of us could just drop dead at any moment. Honestly I feel like this is probably my best hope for getting over my health anxiety and panic attacks but I have no idea how I can train my mind to think like this. I really don't want to die but I want to be able to have this mindset so I can stop constantly thinking about random heart attacks and strokes. Anyone have any input or experience on this matter?,Anxiety
35850,35845,Am i having a seizure? I have been having extreme HA for the past month but last week i have been having really weird symptoms. I have been waking up after 1 or 2 hours of sleep at night shaking and sweating intensely while also feeling confused and scared this last for 30min to an hour then i calm down and go back to sleep. I have had this happen to me 3 times now and im really scared that this is some sort of seizure and that i have a brain tumor. Im freaking out so much and i really dont know what to do.,Anxiety
35854,35849,i had some bloodwork this week amp last and now i got my period is it normal to feel like this or should i do something? hi so last week i had some blood taken for a test. and then this past tuesday i had some taken this one was rough i almost passed out amp threw up. afterwards i felt so gross and tingly and weak. well i got my period last night. and today im back to feeling this tingly weak way my friend said its because they took so much blood and that im on my period which i always have a very heavy flow and also ik anemic so that doesnt help lmao.but yeah no i feel very shaky and my feet are tingling and are going numb my hands are tingling and im just exhausted. i was at work earlier and jokingly asked my friend to check my pulse and she said it actually felt faster than a normal pulse. is this normal? does it make sense? i called my dr just to be safe and they took what i said out of context and went on a tangent and gave a spiel about periods and how i should visit with an OBGYN which im doing at the end of the month i just absolutely hate this feeling of tingly and weak and exhausted. is there anything i can do to make it better? or is it just a waiting game?,Anxiety
35859,35854,how to tell a pimple from early signs of MSRA or flesh eating disease? i'm really hoping this is just from over sweating i had part of my arm resting on my desk i was sweating after listen to music rather energetically i raise my arm and suddenly notice a reddish raised bump that looked like a pimple only thing was it came on suddenly i didn't have this before its not painful mainly slightly soreuncomfortable gets sorer when touched. at first i thought it was just a bite or a pimple i googled Sudden Pimple on arm and got a result for Woman mistakes flesh eating disease for pimple dies. and had a near fucking panic attack. Recently someone in the household had to drive some family to the E.R i'm worried they might have tracked some sort of MRSA back with them as they had to stay for a few hours. I'm really hoping this is just a sweat pimple because the desk could have been impairing the skins ability to breath. I used to get similar bumps on my legs when working out with some particularly uncomfortable briefs so i'm really hoping thats all it is but i can't shake the fear that it could be something more severe.,Anxiety
35874,35869,I hit my head on a wooden door should I see a doctor? Earlier today I hit my head on a wooden door and it hurt for a bit and got me a light bruise in that area. After like a minute or two the hurting stopped and I felt fine. After like 10min however my eyes started to feel weird like my perception has changed I'm still able to type and stuff and I'm not dizzy nor do I have a headache. I even went ahead and played a game to see if I could focus and I was fine. I took a nap to see if it would help I woke up an hour earlier and it still feels weird. I was just wondering is this something I shouldn't be so anxious about or should I go to the doctor? It might just be my anxiety playing tricks on me which has happened before but I'm not sure.,Anxiety

It feels like someone put bricks in the left side of my head and my overall balance is completely off when I'm standing sitting or laying down. The left side of my head is just super heavy and is affecting my walking. It just feels like my entire body is being pulled to the left constantly. It's been about 40 minutes and it is still occuring. I'm super scared it's MS or a Brain tumor because it's ALL I can find when I look it up. Has anyone ever experienced this before?,Anxiety

51601,51876,Horrible Fear of Food Being Drugged Lately Ive been having this massively irrational fear of my food being laced with LSD or some other form of psychedelics. I wont eat something thats been already opened regardless of whether or not its mine which has led to me not only wasting food but actively avoiding eating unless I make it right there and even then it takes quite a bit of effort. This in turn has also led me to having a fear of an undiagnosed mental illness and I cant quite afford to go to a doctor currently to figure out if that is the case.Ive only ever been technically drugged once when the cannabis my friend bought was laced with PCP a few months ago but this fear extends back to when I was around fifteen twenty three now. Ive done acid only twice and while I did enjoy it its not something Im likely to do again and I rarely smoke cannabis or drink but I did do a lot of both for a few years. Obviously nobody is gonna waste good acid on me but the fear is constantly there to the point that I yelled at my brother the other day for jokingly pretending to drop something into my Gatorade on the way to work hes unaware of this fear and threw it away despite it being completely full and even avoided eating the cookies my mom brought down for Christmas which made me feel awful as there is absolutely no way my mom would ever do anything like that to me.Im iffy on telling anybody close to me about this fear for a few reasons the main one being the irrationality of it all but I also do not want to be sent to an inpatient center again cant afford it as I was for depression as a minor. Sorry for the rambling wall of text but I just need to know if this is signs of a more major illness or at the very least how I can possibly cope with it.,Anxiety

It is so so stupid and I mean I'm completely useless anyway like who the hell lives with memory troubles at 20 it feels like some disorder at this point I forget a lot of things My mom is dating an alhogolic and last couple of weeks were a nightmare.

51620,51896,Anxiety dizziness What does everyone's feel like? This has bee driving me mental for a year now as you can probably tell from my post history.Only way I can describe it is I get sudden episodes where I feel sick like I'm falling warm rush feeling and tight head then I snap out of it again. When it's really bad I almost feel numb and out of my own body like everything's in slow motion. Can happen standing sitting laying down. Drives me absolutely mental because I just cannot reconcile how anxiety could cause this so I constantly worry it's my heart. Anyone else get this? What helped stop it for good?,Anxiety
51627,51903,Paranoia It has been a stressful time for me just moved countries. I have always seen things out of the corner of my eye but didnt think anything of this. The last few weeks has gotten more noticeable. Last night I kept seeing shadows to the point I could not move of the couch until I forced myself too. All day its been happening thinking I see things like figures and having images that are horror related come into my head. Every noise I hear Im instantly scared. Has anyone had instances like this?

She got super angry and told me anxiety is not real and that the medical and drug industries are just a big mafia looking to exploit people for profit. She told me I'm just going to get worse and that the medication will turn me into a lethargic zombie.

51654,51929,Im dating someone I really like and its absolutely killing me A bit of background I was diagnosed with ocd and gad about 15 years ago. Been very much under control for the most part. Im 32 years old and just started dating an incredible 31 year old woman about a month ago. Ive dated a lot over the past few years but this is the first time in ages where Ive REALLY been into the person. Normally it feels like the people I date like me more than I like them and anxiety doesnt play a role. I just go about my day with a calm mind and do what needs to be done. But now it feels like the roles are reversed and Im getting crushed. Constant thoughts of whether or not she likes me obsessing over every word in her texts to try interpreting meaning freaking out if shes doesnt respond to my messages within a couple hours. Its taking over my life. My work is slipping I cant sleep well a constant awful sick panicked feeling in the pit of my stomach. It doesnt help that shes very reticent with her emotions and does not offer much words of affection or validation. But I dont want to scare her off with my intense feelings so on the surface Ive been playing it cool the best I can. I almost wish she would just end things with me so I could move on because not knowing how she feels is the worst part.I dont know what to do.,Anxiety

51663,51938,Scared to ask mom for things because of judgement Ok so kinda a weird post and Im not sure if it belongs here but I figured this sub was probably the best one for it. I also tried the social anxiety sub but my post was instantly removed. So basically I have this huge fear of asking my mom for things because I think she will judge me for them. I dont have this fear around anyone else I couldnt care less what anyone else thinks of me but for some reason I have it with her. Im not talking about little things like asking for something at the store or asking for basically any necessity. Im talking about bigger things like hair dye piercings or really anything to do with clothing. For example recently I worked up the confident to ask her over text if I could dye my hair which she is fine with however later that day when she asked me to show her pictures of what I want I chickened out and got to scared to show her. Its like I knew she would say yes but I was still to scared to show her because I was afraid shed say something judgmental to me. She has always been sorta judgmental towards me but I really want to get over this fear because it prevents me from getting a lot of the things I really want. Is there anything I can do?,Anxiety
51665,51940,Feel the feelings Going through a really challenging situation atm and it's made me realise I've been avoiding tough feelings for a long time maybe all my life.Now that I see this am trying to just let them flow and breathe through it but it's really really hard and it hurts and is scary and my avoidance habits are strong.I'll keep trying but if anyone has any advice experience with this that you can share the support would be very welcome.,Anxiety
51694,51970,Is it anxiety and over thinking? Or is it intuition? How to know the difference? My partner has lied to me in the past and now anything that is remotely close to that topic makes me think hes lying. And then I spiral and think I have to check his phone then I think he deleted messages then I need to check his Apple Watch and then I think he may have used another form of contact and I start to feel like maybe Im being illogical and crossing the line. In the moment I feel like nothing can give me relief except for finding solid proof. Im not proud of this behavior. I recently started therapy for my overall anxiety. Unfortunately it is hard to afford to have sessions often enough. Context He lied 1.5 years ago about something relating to a female coworker it was not infidelity. After lying he was able to prove he was telling the truth. I feel 99 confident about it. Since then he lied about about small things like not playing video games while on the phone. Idk I dont want to damage my relationship with this but I also dont want to be lied to again and turn a blind eye. So how can I know if I am acting because of anxiety and overthinking opposed to following intuition and following my gut. My intuition is how I caught his initial lie.,Anxiety
51702,51978,Why can't I believe what the doctors tell me? I 26 M am super frustrated with myself today I had a cardiologist appointment bc I have palpitations sometimes and my heart races randomly when I have acid reflux. The cardiologist did some blood pressurepulse checks to rule out POTS and said I was fine on that front. The EKG came back great and he said my heart was in excellent shape. I even asked him to order a take home monitor for me just for some peace of mind and he was ok with that. I had an echocardiogram done about 1 year ago with a different cardiologist and everything came back great. Now as I get home from the doctor my anxious brain gets to plotting and is now worrying that He didn't order you another echocardiogram what if he's missing something. My rational brain believes and trusts this doctor very much but the anxiety part of my brain just wants to create more worry for any reason it can find. Can anyone give me some advice or insight? Is there even any Medical reason I would need a second echocardiogram 1 year later? I assume it detects defects that have been there probably from birth so a second one is probably pointless but it's hard to tell my anxious brain that. I Just want to believe the doctors when they give me positive news and believe that I'm fine.Edit I should note I am very aware that I have health anxiety and I am currently in therapy for it already It still bugs me though.,Anxiety

51843,52122,I hate my anxiety. Anything that will alterchange my life in some way gives me anxiety.Examples 7years ago my bfnow husband and I bought a dog. I cried and cried the first night we got him because i was soo scared of having totake care of anything else besides me. A few weeks later the anxiety disappeared. I absolutely love my dog.7years ago i left my first job after being there for 5 years. I cried and cried. Had so much anxiety leading up to the new interview. Had ssoo much anxiety after being told i was hired. I was terrified of failing not being able to pay my bills. So much so that i asked for my job back. But was ghosted because they were upset i had quit in the first place. 7 years later still at this newjob its consistent i make money. I feel secure. And glad i left the place prior. 3 years ago i got engaged but wasnt anxious about anything. Because we halted planning a wedding to buy a house. 2 years ago my fianc and i bought a house. It was fun leading up to the week before closing. The day before i was crying anxious scared. I felt like iwas making a mistake. What if we lose the house? What if something happens and we cant afford it because we have a mortgage now. I was fine after a couple days. Im sssoo happy in my home. 8 months ago i got married. For the 34 months leading up to the wedding i had horrible anxiety. Every single night id have lingering anxiety some nights better than others but always there. The week before the wedding i was a mess scared of being married scared of the change. But i am ssoo in love with my fianc he is my everything. I couldnt understand the anxiety because i was happy! The day of the wedding i was emotion filled i couldnt talk to anyone while getting ready i was a nervous wreck. Once we left the church i felt ssooo different! I was actually FEELING how i felt. Happy excited in love. Not anxious. The reception was amazing! Im soo happy!Nowim 29 husband is 30. We are talking about kids. I want them but im sssooo afraid of the anxiety i know ill have. Im scared of the pregnancy what if i have a difficult time what if im anxious like i was for the wedding for all 9months? Im soo scared of giving birth of the potential postpartum depression me not connecting. Or what if i dont connect with baby? Idk im already anxious thinking about having an approximate date to get off birth control. Im scared. I brought up adoption but i hate the fact that id rather chose adoption JUST because of the anxiety. I know ill deal with it when the time comes closer to adopt. But it wont be 9months.

51848,52127,Trembling when talking about things Im around and dont scare me after having bad experience with weed edibles This might be a long post so sorry about that but I just want to have all the details. Back in December my now ex girlfriend gave me 2 weed edible gummies that were around a year old I think Im not entirely sure if this is true or not but I think they were each about 50 mg when brand new. This was the first time Ive done any drugs or anything like that not even weed but I wanted them from her and accepted them with a smile on my face being excited to do them. I then get home and eat them both at once and Im feeling pretty awesome and happy but cant really focus on anything and Im laughing a lot and smiling at everything while on a FaceTime call with some friends. Then I start noticing my heart was beating incredibly fast and strong at least I think it was I thought the left side of my chest would explode and started freaking out about that. I ended up freaking out and having a almost full on panic attack and thought I was going to die and forced myself to throw up then laid in the shower for about 2 hours on the coldest setting not realizing I was shivering and shaking like crazy the entire time I then force myself to sleep and wake up thinking Im dead and feeling like shit for the next week or so and had weird pains in my chest. I then cut off almost all contact with the girlfriend thinking back I shouldnt have done this and I do feel bad I was just so shaken up because of that experience fast forward to now I am around lots of talk about drugs I always have but about 3 weeks ago when I was going to smoke my fiends cart for the first time just talking about it gave me these tremors and I was shaking until I calmed down about 10 minutes later but I was talking to him with a smile on my face wanting to hit his cart I wasnt scared at all I just got these shakes these jitters in my legs I dont even understand why their happening when Im actually in front of or about to do drugs that dont even scare me just on Wednesday I was going to buy some weed regular flower from my other friend and I got the same trembles just texting him and had to play it off with the people next to me saying Im cold.

51884,52164,Ive been having panic attacks that resulted in extreme adrenaline rushes daily for the past few weeks. I am a 24yo male i have suffered with gad and panic attacks ever since i was 16. Over the years i went to therapy and even overcame mostly at least my health anxiety. To a point that both my psychiatrist psychotherapist? Imho not sure English isnt my first language and I felt as if could go back to going to a psychologist. Everything has been going okay i kept eating well i exercise regularly 45 times x week at the gym walks with my dog and i try to walk around as much as i can other than my commute to work not 10k steps on most days but i try to stay active I have been on medications. I used xanax regularly and then started using it only if needed. Once these panic attacks began i decided to switch to diazepam since the xanax was making me very sleepy without helping too much with the anxiety. That didnt help. I started having panic attacksadrenaline rushes for every minor incident or event. 5 mins late for a meetupreservation? High heart rate anxiety all the usual. Calling a client on the phone and telling them theyll have to pay xx amount? Same result. Everything minor sends me towards a panic attackadrenaline rush. Even weed which i smoked probably once per week on a friday evening started giving me horrible panic attacks even if wasnt still high yet. Im really at a loss here i dont want to go on like this and Im kind of worried for my health and the impact this anxiety has on it. I will bring this up during my next session but in the meantime i wanted to confront myself with someone that hasis experiencing the same issues.Thank you all,Anxiety

51994,52279,Driving Anxiety Hi everyone I wanted to just put a note here to see if this is a common symptom people experience even with medication.Ever since 2020 I developed severe anxiety that seemed to arise behind the wheel. It started with little things I would hit a bump and would spend a little longer looking in the rear view mirror than I ordinarily would. Eventually it escalated to the point where I would compulsively circle blocks or pull over just to make sure that these bumps and potholes were not pedestrians. And if I did circle a block usually there would be OTHER potholes or bumps which would lead to a mental downward spiral that drove me quite literally to insanity. It was one of these spirals that led to my first trip for psychiatric evaluation.After beginning medication this generally subsided to a manageable level and with CBT I was doing pretty good. Then in December of 2022 my wife and I were stopped at a red light when us and two other vehicles were completely totalled by an F350 who rear ended us travelling at roughly 80 KMh. He ran from the incident. Everyone was miraculously not seriously injured but Ive been set back to pre medication levels of anxiety while driving. This hypervigilance I drive quite a bit has now lead to significant physical illness for me. From stress Ive ground my molars to completely flat and the tension within my body from being so braced? I guess? And overly vigilant while driving is really locking me up. Ive gained a lot of weight too. Its lead to serious depression as Ive built a life that requires me to have a limber body.Does anyone have any similar stories to share? Or even just some relevant encouragement Im really getting to the end of my rope lately because of this.Thank you beautiful humans please drive safe and treat yourself gently.,Anxiety

52073,52362,Anxiety seriously holding me back. Any insight is greatly appreciated. Hi everyone This is my first time posting on here and this may turn out to be an essay but please bear with me and read to the end. I promise to make this as concise as possible.I'm in my late 20's male and have had anxiety since the beginning of high school. It felt super overwhelming back then and high school could have been an amazing experience had anxiety not gotten in the way. I went to university fairly late and after graduating kept landing contract work and eventually got stuck working at the same grocery store I applied to as an undergrad. The anxiety carried over into the workplace and resulted in my inability to work at a fast pace. I always felt mentally and physically exhausted.This is where I have to mention alcohol and caffeine both of which produce superhuman like effects but with a caveatI tried alcohol for the first time in Montreal at the age of 18 and after downing 2 beers it felt like I had ingested an elixir. My worries went away instantly and felt my brain firing on all cylinders. There were 0 negative emotions and a profound combination of confidence energy euphoria and heightened creativity. I never got addicted to drinking for obvious reasons and only drink on occasion but every time I do it produces the same effects. I also never get drunk. Coffee seems to produce eerily similar effects and I realized this a few years ago after I had a coffee at work and felt like I had snorted crack. I thought I could take on the world and was super excited that I had finally found a solution to my problem. Unfortunately however if I have coffee everyday for 4 days straight by the 4th day it produces the exact opposite effects and I'm left feeling sleepy and lethargic. For me to feel the full effects of coffee I need to refrain from it for at least 7 days. Fast forward to today where I recently started working construction as a sprinkler fitterpipefitter and absolutely hate it. Apart from being a fastpaced environment I'm asthmatic with an allergy to dust and constantly drilling holes into a concrete ceiling has made my asthma worse plus the cement we use to glue the plastic leaves me with a pounding headache during and after work so I know my days are numbered. The company that I'm employed with is currently waiting on a new project so I've had the last 7 days off During this time I've begun doing research on career alternatives and have become very interested in the online world and have decided to upgrade my skills in ecommerce digital marketing and video editing among other things. My morning routine involves getting up at 8 o'clock feeling tired having breakfast followed by tea with milk which produces similar effects to coffee with much less intensity. After having tea my anxiety goes away and I become very focused however when the caffeine wears off my anxiety returns and I go back to feeling mentally exhausted constant worrying overthinking fear of failure lack of motivation etc.As far as I know I'm not depressed nor do I have low selfesteem. I feel good about the way I look and the shape I'm in. Going to the gym helps. I don't have any bad habits. I don't smoke nor do I indulge in social media looking for a dopamine fix. Most of my free time is spent reading online and on YouTube searching educational videos. I also get 7 to 8 hours of sleep every night but usually wake up tired. The only complaint I have with life is my anxiety. Without it I have a powerful personality and I feel like I'm capable of achieving so much but it's causing me to operate at only 50 of my full potential.I was wondering if anyone is able to offer any insight as to why alcohol and caffeine produce such similar effects practically eliminating my anxiety before the effects wear off and if anyone has had similar experiences? Could alcohol and caffeine contain something which I might be deficient in? Could I get this in a pill form?I was thinking of making an appointment with my family doctor but just thought I'd reach out here to see what the members here have to add. I'm open to the idea of trying antidepressants but at the same time worried about the side effects. Do antidepressants really only cause side effects in the first couple of weeks? Based on some of my research that seems to be the case. Apologies for the long post and I would greatly appreciate any input. Thanks.,Anxiety
52081,52371,I can feel something in my lower throat or upper lungs. Im not sick but when I am the mucus is usually felt in the back of my throat rather than where I can feel something now. Im at work constantly trying to clear my throat and googling how to cough up phlegm even though Im not sure that it is phlegm. I cant concentrate on anything else and Im worrying that I have a disease. I havent done any work in the last 40 minutes because I keep googling and getting up when Im restless. Considering leaving work early to go home but I know itll sound stupid. I also know that my reaction to overpowering anxious thoughts is to leave wherever I am and go home so I know the reason for wanting to go home isnt because I feel physically sick enough.I wish I could just sit with this mild physical discomfort and cough every now and then like a normal person but instead every time I feel the thing in my chest a wave of anxiety paralyses me. I dont know how to get through the day.What should I do?,Anxiety
52087,52377,Inner Sanctuary of Peace Hello this is a short story that at least for me it was a great anxiety relief. If you like it I will post more. Once upon a time in a serene village nestled within a lush green valley there lived a gentle wise elephant named Elara. This village was known for its tranquility as it was graced with a unique energy that seemed to ease the worries and stresses of all who lived there.One day a young girl named Mia came to the village seeking relief from her overwhelming anxiety. Upon hearing about Elara's wisdom she ventured to the peaceful grove where the elephant resided. The moment Mia approached she felt her heart rate slowing and her breath deepening.Elara I've heard of your wisdom and calming presence. Please can you help me with my anxiety? Mia asked timidly.Elara looked at her with gentle eyes and replied Of course dear child. Sit down beside me and let me share with you the secret to finding peace within yourself.As Mia settled down Elara began to tell her a story.Long ago our village was visited by a wise old monk. He too had experienced the tranquility of our valley and wished to uncover the source of this peaceful energy. He spent many days meditating under the ancient oak tree at the center of the village. Finally he discovered the secret within each of us exists a tiny peaceful oasis an inner sanctuary that remains untouched by the chaos of the world.The wise elephant continued To access this sanctuary you must learn to quiet your mind and listen to the rhythm of your own breath. Begin by taking slow deep breaths inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. With each breath imagine your worries dissolving into the wind leaving only peace and tranquility behind.Mia closed her eyes and followed Elara's guidance. As she inhaled and exhaled she felt her anxiety ebbing away replaced with a sense of calm and safety she had never known before.After some time Mia opened her eyes and looked at the wise elephant. Thank you Elara. Your words have brought me peace and I will carry this lesson with me wherever I go.As Mia prepared to leave Elara touched her trunk gently to the girl's shoulder. Remember dear child your inner sanctuary is always within you. Whenever you feel overwhelmed or anxious simply close your eyes breathe deeply and allow yourself to find refuge in the peaceful oasis of your heart.With newfound strength and a heart filled with gratitude Mia returned to her life carrying the wisdom of Elara and the tranquility of the village with her. She had discovered the power of her inner sanctuary and now she was ready to face the world with courage and serenity.,Anxiety

52132,52423,Help for when your anxiety turns physical? I've had panic attacks and such but one thing that's a bit more off and on is how anxiety affects my stomach. When I had daily stomach pains in elementary school that were unexplained it now makes sense that it was definitely anxiety brewing.I'm going through a period right now where my stomach is just revolting against me. I have the urge to go just about all day every day and will sometimes go 24 times a day when my usual is once a day plus it's now usually loose which wasn't an issue before.The only thing I've found to kind of help is Tazo Zen tea. It does ease the stomach upset a bit but I also can't drink THAT much of it before making myself nauseouseven more sick. How does everyone deal with this in terms of their anxiety? I only have this issue on weekdays when I have work I'm usually normal on weekends so it's obviously the anxiety. I just feel tortured by my stomach right now.

52197,52491,I really need some help with managing my anxiety when it comes to lack of cleanliness Hey everyone. I'm new here. I'm writing this to be very transparent and to ask for help. I don't want to ruin my relationship or participate in toxic communication habits. I am finding that my anxiety really acts up when my apartment isn't clean. My husband and I both aren't the best when it comes to doing the dishes as soon as we use them or cleaning up clothes right away. But I feel like I atleast take initiative and try. I feel he usually won't start cleaning on his own unless it's his own stuff or I practically yell at him to. I feel like I shouldn't even have to ask my partner to care about taking care of our home. I can't be the only one doing it. I'm honestly losing it because sometimes I get so frustrated and anxious I do get mad quickly. How do I change this? It's not even like I want to be mad it just happens because I've reached my limit mentally. I'm not on meds I wouldn't even know what to ask for.I feel like I just don't wanna have to ask him to clean anymore. Why can't he just do it on his own? I don't think I'm asking for a lot and I'm made to feel like a bitch or like I'm lecturing him when I'm all I'm doing is asking me to do some chores. In fact why do I even have to ask? I feel hopeless. I feel stuck. I can't afford a housekeeper every week right now. I can't control him. I just wanna know what I can do to manage my anxiety around this. And please no stupid advice like leave him because we are married. I know this issue can be fixed I just don't know where to start.,Anxiety
52200,52495,My progress how I learned to live and progress with my anxiety. Ive had anxiety for years since I was very young I remember being afraid of everything and having phobias of germs getting sick heights flying driving certain foods etc. I was constantly scared as a child and eventually as I went off to college when I was 16 I slowly learned to live with my anxiety. I tried new things I slowly came out of my shell. When I hit 34.. everything came to a head I had gone through a major divorce at 33 lived through COVID under constant fear I was diagnosed with PCOS was moving across the country in May and was the heaviest I had ever been May 2022. By August 2022 I had lost 70lbs in almost two months because I was so afraid to eat I was basically crying every single day. I couldnt eat and refused to my emetophobia was so strong I could barely move everyday. I was in the ER multiple times having procedures and CT scans done and no one could find out what was wrong with me. It was then that I finally decided that I needed medication I talked to a psychiatrist for the first time. I felt like a failure I had been through so much but I couldnt break this fear and horror of food. Therapy wasnt helping and I had been so afraid of food that no one could get me to eat more than a bite or two for a whole day. I was prescribed medication because one of its side effects was to rise my appetite and at first it didnt work. I felt again so defeated and exhausted. They put me on a higher dose.. and after a few weeks I felt hungry. I had cravings again. I felt like finally eating and I was so famished I finally ate a piece of pizza because the cheese looked so good I couldnt not eat it.September 2022 I decided to start going to the gym I was scared at first I only would go in for 20 minutes 3 times a week. I was so weak I had lost all my muscle starving myself. October 2022 I went to the gym for the first time for an hour. I went up to the free weights and was discouraged but then watched some YouTube videos and started building workouts. I walked my first mile without pain. I was eating 1800 calories a day. I wasnt as afraid. November 2022 I ate out at a restaurant for the first time in months! I had nachos and they were delicious. I wasnt afraid! I had my colonoscopy and they found IBS and colitis. I finally had answers to my stomach pains. December 2022 I made a big Christmas dinner with my partner and roommate and I ate a full meal! I was now lifting at the gym 5 times a week. January 2023 I travelled out of the state on a plane! I ate out almost everyday! I enrolled back into school for my masters. February 2023 to now I workout 5 days a week and I walk 23 miles every single day. I keep my body on a routine for my chronic illnesses and I eat a focused healthy diet everyday.Some days are still hard some days have anxiety.. some days my stomach hurts and I have flare ups randomly. But every bad day has five times better ones. I focus on the positive I try not to be afraid of anything anymore. And even if I am? I remember it cant hurt me and Ill be okay tomorrow. I wish everyone the best of luck in your journey and recovery ,Anxiety

52220,52515,Ive been reading this vape study Im getting freaked out convinced Im going to die. My future is fucked and I feel like giving up. httpswww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpmcarticlesPMC8913014Hello 20M and I quit vaping 3 months ago after vaping for 4 years and I have no plans on going back. Picked up this habit in high school peer pressure and it continued because I was in the same group of friends since then. Vaped here and there in high school and every damn day in college. Chain vaping 55 mg nic salt pretty much. Obviously this is my fault but I cant help but think my future is uncertain and I probably fucked up my health. My lung has been feeling weird for a few months now and its causing me anxiety. Its getting to the point where I dont even want to do anything in college that could help my career because I think Im going to die in the near future. Like whats the point. Im convinced Im going to die from lung cancer sometime in the future or cardiac issues. Ive been having chest pain and its scary. I take an snri rn and its helping but the thoughts wont go away. Its getting to the point where Im reconsidering my whole life because I feel like I ruined it. Im very depressed and anxious about it and I wish I knew vaping was absolutely terrible for you before I even started. I know this post may seem dramatic but this is what goes through my head every morning until I sleep. I keep thinking it wasnt supposed to be this way. Ive gotten straight As my entire life been going to the gym eating right. Im in college about to go into a career path thats exciting and the future potentially could have been great but I have my one single vice that I was too stupid to quit. Damn idk I just needed to vent because it gets exhausting. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this kind of stuff. Obv my parents dont know about this they just think Im very distressed and depressed about school or smt. I see all of my peers off doing amazing things with their lives and Im just going through this bs. Its pathetic the person Ive become. Younger me wouldve died if he saw what I turned into. Throwing away life it seems like just for a little buzz. Ive been trying to get my friends off this shit too but they prob see me as biased due to my health anxiety with vaping.They are great but I cant help but feel I wouldnt be in this situation if I stayed away from the red flags. Once one person starts doing it its like dominos and no one thinks twice about it being bad. Damn my whole life building up to smt and I just jeopardize it over bullshit. I just needed to vent the health anxiety is getting bad to the point where Im certain cancer or a heart attack is coming and theres no point anymore.,Anxiety

Recently my Tik Tok has been infested with investment bankers and even scammer type video of people in their 20s making 600000k per year. I know the fallacy that social media is fake. But it is making me spiral a little. I go to a T100 law school which is decent and I have decent grades even an interview soon. I just feel I wasted so much time and energy and should have aimed to be making that 600 already.

But now Im thinking I need to aim for that for the sake of my struggling parents and my current gf who comes from wealth and doesnt currently work but loves luxury.,Anxiety

52415,52716,Did I have a panic attack? About a month ago I F 25 had what I think was a panic attack. Ive gone through childhood physical and emotional abuse and traumatic events in adult hood family member has tired to take their life a few times but I have resisted the idea of getting professional help for myself since I was 1112 and have only opened up about 90 with my long term boyfriend.In 2017 I was at an all time low and was feeling like life wasnt worth it and felt numb to the world. One night after going for dinner with work friends I was walking home and collapsed on the ground. I was conscious but felt so numb my body and mind just gave up there and then. Some people came to help me and called an ambulance for me. When the paramedics arrived the shook me and got me on a bed I didnt talk but could hear them. I suddenly snapped out of it when they rolled me into the ambulance and started crying. The paramedic pricked me with a needle on my finger to test me for something. It hurt and was unexpected. They said they had to take me to the hospital to check me out but I was sure in my head that nothing was physically wrong with me. I got to the hospital and was so embarrassed and ashamed that I told staff I should leave and I went home. I was so incredibly embarrassed and ashamed and still am. How dare I just let all that happen when I wasnt an emergency and what if someone somewhere needed help and was dying. I just dont understand why didnt snap out of it. Fast forward to a month ago. I was at first aid training ironically and that machine that pricks your finger was brought out to show us. The instructor used it on his own hand. I remembered immediately what I had done in 2017 and all the feelings of shame guilt embarrassment came rushing back. I didnt think much of it and we moved onto what the readings of the blood would tell you. I suddenly started feeling my hands sweat and a hotness covered my hands and seemed to radiate throughout my whole body and face. I was taking notes and my hand became so weak I couldnt keep writing. Then I realised my hands were shaking uncontrollably. At this point I was thinking it was in my head but then my heart started racing sooo incredibly fast. I was still sure it was in my head as all I could think about was that Im not someone who faints at the sight of blood. Then I started feeling like I was going to faint and to my embarrassment I had to stick my hand up and say infront of the class I was not feeling well. I got up and staggered outside the room and sat on a chair. The instructor followed me clearly concerned. I then started thinking I was having a heart attack and was about to die. I genuinely started thinking what is everyone going to think if I die right here my boyfriend my family. I was telling the instructor that I dont normally faint and that I felt weird and that my pulse was fast. The instructor took my pulse and told me to slow my breathing hadnt even noticed how fast and heavy I was breathing. Soon as he told me that I started calming down and thought if hes not worried about me dying then maybe Im not. I started feeling much better after that. At the end of the class he said he reckons it was a little bit of anxiety. Was that a panic attack? Whatever it was it scared me. Since then Ive had 6 more with varying degrees but the first was the worst. This has pushed me to tell my doctor I need to speak to someone as Im scared its going to happen in public and now Im being referred to therapy so Im not diagnosed with anything yet so am clueless. Sorry for the long post.,Anxiety
52418,52719,Trigger Warning Does anyone else get an anxiety attack when Is it just me? Anyone have advice on how to manage treat? Does anyone else have anxiety attacks over small things of repetitive nature? Like for example I can have a full on attack when my bf picks or pulls at his beard. Or when someone is tapping their fingers or legs. It seems like I get triggered by other peoples coping mechanisms. This has been extremely frustrating because my bf has this habit when he is anxious and not even realizing it and its causing my to have attacks and then I am zorped and on edge. And he is constantly on edge trying to look out for me. We are trying different things like closing doors and both trying to be mindful but I would really like help on how to manage and treat it. Does anyone else share a similar experience? I am also currently in therapy and working on it but she doesnt have any experience with this and am beginning to give up.,Anxiety
52428,52728,My anxiety is ruining my personal relationships Recently I got a fairly nice gift for a friend's birthday 40 worth which isn't an extravagant gift but definitely the nicest gift I've given in this particular friendgroup. I was really excited about this gift because I thought it was a good fit for this person. Unfortunately my excitement for giving this gift turned to anxiety as I became concerned about how such a relatively nice gift might be perceived being given to a friend of the opposite sex.... I REALIZE THIS IS COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL.... as most of my anxiety is.So this became a trigger for a multiweek bout of extremely high anxiety and this person definitely realized that they were the trigger for it one way or another......... and now it seems like they are at the point that they are starting to get a little freaked out and I'm afraid of losing one of my closest friends.

YOU are experiencing your life. nobody knows how you feel. your feelings are valid and its okay to set boundaries. its okay if you cant do it today. it takes a lot of energy for you to always fight against your worries and anxiety. so its totally understandable if you need some space and peace. dont surround yourself with people that drain your energy. its okay to let them go. this gives you more energy to focus on the good people and things in your life.i hope you have a good day today. but also dont have too much expectations. its totally fine if not everything is going to work out today.,Anxiety
52554,52862,Horrible Fear of Food Being Drugged Lately Ive been having this massively irrational fear of my food being laced with LSD or some other form of psychedelics. I wont eat something thats been already opened regardless of whether or not its mine which has led to me not only wasting food but actively avoiding eating unless I make it right there and even then it takes quite a bit of effort. This in turn has also led me to having a fear of an undiagnosed mental illness and I cant quite afford to go to a doctor currently to figure out if that is the case.Ive only ever been technically drugged once when the cannabis my friend bought was laced with PCP a few months ago but this fear extends back to when I was around fifteen twenty three now. Ive done acid only twice and while I did enjoy it its not something Im likely to do again and I rarely smoke cannabis or drink but I did do a lot of both for a few years. Obviously nobody is gonna waste good acid on me but the fear is constantly there to the point that I yelled at my brother the other day for jokingly pretending to drop something into my Gatorade on the way to work hes unaware of this fear and threw it away despite it being completely full and even avoided eating the cookies my mom brought down for Christmas which made me feel awful as there is absolutely no way my mom would ever do anything like that to me.Im iffy on telling anybody close to me about this fear for a few reasons the main one being the irrationality of it all but I also do not want to be sent to an inpatient center again cant afford it as I was for depression as a minor. Sorry for the rambling wall of text but I just need to know if this is signs of a more major illness or at the very least how I can possibly cope with it.,Anxiety

I've been on Abilify and Alprazolam for years never had been feeling alert on them always either sleepy or have weird feeling in my stomach. Now I've tried everything with these meds be it smoking or alcohol I stopped all of it because it caused very nasty problems with me when I stopped I finally felt myself even through I've read on Wikipedia that coffee can also cause problems when you take these meds it's says even small amounts can cause side effects that's called caffeine induced anxiety.I'm not really sure how am I supposed to be awake I mean I'm unemployed still in hands of my parents and other family members who take care of me and understand my problems but how did you manage to stay awake without coffee or did coffee really help you without feeling weird all time while on meds? It would be stupid for me to sleep all day and miss some important events or have fun chatting with friends or playing video games or better yet studying different topics like electrical engineering or making homemade circuits. Not electrical engineer just doing something for hobby.,Anxiety
52576,52885,germ anxiety please help I invited my friend over to stay because it was late but I have crippling germophobia and ocd. I feel horrible because I love my friend to bits. but im so triggered rn because I cleaned the toilet and we didn't have gloves and I don't know if she used it yet and now im terrified of having a disease I can't stop spiraling,Anxiety
52601,52909,Anxiety stopping me from working Ive been dealing with anxiety for a while now I came to the realisation a few years ago that it has mainly stemmed from the relationship with my dad I had when I was younger. This is caused me to not be able to do tasks in front of people wether they be simple or not I just cant do it. I start lightly trembling and thinking about how stupid I must look to whoever is watching me this causes me to mess up even more. This is really stopped me from wanting to go out and get a job because I know that if the interview goes well I actually do good in interviews weirdly then I will eventually have to be shadowed and critiqued by someone while I learn the job. This dread has stopped me from going to 3 interviews now. Does anyone else get this? Sorry for the long post.,Anxiety
52607,52915,Im dating someone I really like and its absolutely killing me A bit of background I was diagnosed with ocd and gad about 15 years ago. Been very much under control for the most part. Im 32 years old and just started dating an incredible 31 year old woman about a month ago. Ive dated a lot over the past few years but this is the first time in ages where Ive REALLY been into the person. Normally it feels like the people I date like me more than I like them and anxiety doesnt play a role. I just go about my day with a calm mind and do what needs to be done. But now it feels like the roles are reversed and Im getting crushed. Constant thoughts of whether or not she likes me obsessing over every word in her texts to try interpreting meaning freaking out if shes doesnt respond to my messages within a couple hours. Its taking over my life. My work is slipping I cant sleep well a constant awful sick panicked feeling in the pit of my stomach. It doesnt help that shes very reticent with her emotions and does not offer much words of affection or validation. But I dont want to scare her off with my intense feelings so on the surface Ive been playing it cool the best I can. I almost wish she would just end things with me so I could move on because not knowing how she feels is the worst part.I dont know what to do.,Anxiety
52615,52923,Has anyone tried EMDR therapy? I just started. If so what are your thoughts? I like it so far but mostly just because it triggers my ASMR. Did you have success?,Anxiety
52633,52942,is it normal for an SSRI to make you feel like you're literally dying I was prescribed 50 mg Zoloft for anxiety and depression which I took for the first time last night. What followed was the most excruciatingly painful and unbearable 12 hours of my life. I threw up anything I ate heart was pounding nonstop my entire body was numb and I couldn't sleep without being constantly woken up by stomach pain or nausea. Pretty much all the anxiety symptoms I normally get except all at once and multiplied 100x. At certain points I honestly felt like I was about to die or pass out.I know people say that it gets worse before it gets better but nothing could have prepared me for this. I don't think I'm gonna take another dose until I can talk with my psychiatrist and be absolutely certain this won't happen again. Anyone else have a similar experience or am I just really fucking unlucky,Anxiety
52641,52950,Oh anxiety you are weird sometimes. 6 to 7 years ago I was diagnosed with GADPTSD. 2 years ago I was diagnosed with adhd. I have managed it all this time with no medicine and I have been fine with for the most part. The only time my anxiety would rise a little bit is when it was triggered by stress. Which then I knew I just had to balance it out again.Well this month ended up with heighten anxiety due to an allergic reaction being around seafood one week later got a tooth pulled 2 days later I was fussed at by an ER doctor and then one week later after that I had anxiety reflux kick back so hard that it cause two days of back to back panic attacks. My anxiety was so bad that I couldnt eat anything but rice and chicken no meds and being around doctors frighten me. I couldnt manage to get myself out of that anxiety loop. Well I was finally about to get some hydroxyzine for as needed dosage 3 weeks later. My anxiety was down back to a manageable level but my fears were still there. I took one 25 mg pill in the evening. I got an euphoria feeling and drowsiness the whole next day along with diarrhea. Then all my anxiety was gone. I can eat food again without fear. Im not scared to take meds again. This is the weirdest Anxiety is the moment I have ever dealt with. However Im now pondering if with my anxiety reflux being kicked up it had my stomach and brain a relay lap so when I took the hydroxyzine it suppressed that nerve in my stomach and it help my stomach feel better and then which stop the relay cycle. I guess that is something I will have to remember to ask my doctor.,Anxiety
52648,52957,Blood pressureHeartrate First time posting here. For context I suffer with anxiety obviously and also have bipolar and OCD parents. I find myself constantly obsessing over high blood pressure and high BPM. I'm a heavy set guy. I'm trying to be healthier but I have a long way to go on that. Sometimes hours of my day are spent stressing over whether my heart rate is too high and when I do so I find it usually makes it go higher. I hate going to the doctor because of it because I know my BP will be high and I don't want to know how high. Today I had to go to the doctor and ofc it was high but I was also having a panic attack while they were checking it because of the nerves I have around the whole thing and already had to walk 3 miles just to get there. I wasn't even there over my blood pressure. Anyway after the visit I was sobbing and hyperventilating the whole way home. I just don't know what to do. Obviously I have to get it under control but in the meantime I need to find some way not to obsess over it because it keeps triggering panic attacks.,Anxiety
52649,52958,Life I just wanna rant ab this cuz im embarrassed saying it irl because we all struggle and its not something special. i just hate how lifes going and might go. im find im just in college i have a fine family situation and everything but man im just tired working doing homework and whatnot. the fact that i have to keep working hard in both of these categories to succeed in the future makes me very anxious and i hate it. imma keep going tho i just hate it.,Anxiety
52673,52982,Quitting Zoloft first day. Im spiraling what do I do? I need help. Please I need so much help. I took it at 930 pm last night. The first hour I felt amazing then i went to sleep. I woke up and I couldnt tell if I was awake or asleep. Everything was moving in slow motion. I had so much anxiety that it felt like my chest was burning. I couldnt feel my own heartbeat. I was able to go back to sleep but I feel the same thing now its been 22.5 hours later. My head feels like it wants to explode. Im dizzy and off balance. Cant stop shaking. I want to vomit my brains out. So much anxiety it hurt so bad. Im going back to the doctor tomorrow. they told me not to take the second dose. 50mg. Ive never been on any medicine before. My body hates it. I just want this to stop please.My question is how long will it be until I stop feeling this way? I want this feeling gone. My head is so heavy. What do I do?,Anxiety
52675,52984,Just one of those days Im having anxiety at work i hate feeling this way. I took these gummies OLLY brand to help my anxiety I shouldnt have skipped them yesterday and decided to take them today. I also had a little bit of coffee to wake me up some which was not the best idea. My boss is making me do cakes which I hate being the cake decorator. I have expressed this 100 times but nothing. I have a lot to do. Its just not a good day. I guess the only good thing is I have stuff waiting for me at home retail therapy I hate days like this.,Anxiety

52703,53013,What's your storyexperience of successfully getting out of your comfort zone while having anxiety? I still try to do everything even thought I'm dealing with anxiety this month the feeling of impending doom and the last step for now is to return to my part time job since I've been on holidays.So I would like to hear what stuff were you guys scared of doing but still did it and are proud? It can literally be anything,Anxiety
52711,53021,Compulsively giving myself anxiety? Recently I just stand doing nothing and then my body gives me anxiety? Like... I used to remember things and get anxious but this time even moving my eyes gives me anxiety? Feels like fear of having that feeling causes that feeling. A sudden sharp pain in chest. I dont know how to stop this. I get triggered once in a minute and im scared of having heart issues because of this. There is also a mild pain in my chest all the time. It feels so weird to lose control that much lol.,Anxiety
52728,53038,Nobody takes me seriously Ive 24M dealt with depressionanxiety for years now. I used to be great with people make good money have the nice cars great girlfriend supportive parents friends that I could say looked up to me etc. and then I was diagnosed with depression. Within about a year I quit my job lost my girlfriend even though she was great to me and have yet to keep a stable job for more than a month at a time. My depression eventually was ruled to be treatment resistant after being on a number of meds and trying many other things. Some would work for a couple months and then Id fall even further back from where I was. But now after not having worked since early July of 2022 I am dealing with extensive and scary brain fog. Ive incorporated working out eating healthier taking supplements and just trying to live a healthier lifestyle as I figured this was coming from a bad diet my whole life. I also got all blood work done including thyroid basics vitamin levels testosterone etc and everything came back normal other than pretty high cholesterol. Both doctors Ive seen general practitioner psychiatrist has kinda blown me off when I tell them about the brain fog. Almost like they dont really know what to say or what the next step should be to ruling out causes. Im so scared as Im feeling like Im going crazy or have dementia. My parents are usually very supportive when Im going through stuff but my mom doesnt even want to hear me talk about it and my dad isnt always around as he lives about 45 mins away. I ended up packing some things and driving to his house tonight without saying anything to my mom. I just hate feeling alone and dont know what to do anymore. I feel like Im at the end of my road,Anxiety
45403,45400,Husband has just about blocked me out and refuses to deal with my mental health issues In some ways I can't blame him but I need someone. Right now I have a good friend to talk to but she really just doesn't get it. She never saw the bad years. My husband lived them.I have been married almost 12 years. I know that I've been working hard to act better and my actions have been consistently much more thought out and I've been MUCH less volatile. I can let things go that I would have never been able to before. The other night my really stressed out husband he went back to college and has just been grumpy the whole time flew off the handle at me. Over something I said about Mexican CocaCola. Anyway I just let him vent as he said things like You just make me want to hate you. And he referred to the last time I was in the hospital as the Smlybright show. making everything about me. He immediately referred to how selfish I am which I really haven't been in a long time. This isn't even really him! I least I hope he hasn't turned into this guy!I WAS selfish a long time ago. I was mean a long time ago I was way too hypersexual a long time ago. And he has dealt with all of it. But he can't ever forgive me for anything. He has stopped being there when I really need him because he has just started blocking me out. He doesn't want to deal with me. I cry in private. I contemplate leaving or dying in private. I can't talk to him about these things anymore because we've had this conversation 100 times and you never remember what I tell you anyway and I have my own problems to deal with and I know how you feel because I'm depressed and have problems with that and I still am moving forward because somebody has take care of this family we don't have kids. He means the pets. Which I definitely help with. We haven't had sex in about a year. For years prior I felt like he just did it to get his obligatory sex in for the quarter. When we got married we had sex all the time and then I wanted it all the time and he didn't anymore. Then he says he felt like I was using him. Maybe I was. I would actually throw fits about it. Crying screaming fits. Embarrassing but I'm being honest in this post.Medicine has made me gain a lot of weight. He says it's not me. It's that he needs to feel like I am a safe place mentally physically and emotionally. I still wonder if it's just my body. But I take my medicine because it works.He says I get worse every year but when I really look at myself I know I'm doing better in a lot of really important ways. My relationships with other people not so much my husband right now have improved tremendously. I am not working anymore well some part time but not a lot but I'm slowly becoming more productive and balancing my functionality with my anxiety and the pressure it makes me feel. I bring in the money because I was medically retired from the military.I think sometimes it's how you look at your illness. You can only really judge your own level of the illness affecting your life because you are the only one inside your brain. It's easy to forget the good times when we are feeling low. Last time I had some pretty bad depression I honestly couldn't think of any reason to keep going. I started to end things. But at the critical moment I just had this strong feeling that I was checking out FOREVER. No more good days OR bad days and that I could always off myself if I wanted to so I'd live another day and reevaluate later. And things got better. And then worse and then better. Any advice on any of this would be great. Sometimes I feel like I don't even like him anymore. A lot of times I feel like I love the old him but not this guy who at one time was always there and now refuses to deal with me.,Bipolar

45423,45419,I shared my story and something wonderful happened. Would you mind sharing your story? December was a very difficult month for me and this subreddit became a sanctuary during some especially hard moments. So first of all thank you to all of you. You have helped me to realize I am not alone in this.As a sort of therapy for myself I shared a video of my recent challenges on Facebook. I felt completely vulnerable and almost removed it. But then responses of love and encouragement began pouring in. It was empowering and brought me a sense of hope I haven't had in a while.People from all parts of my life began private messaging me sharing their own stories of mental health challenges.I realized that talking openly about my challenges is very helpful to me in the start of the journey to management. I invite you to hear my storyhttpswww.facebook.comtommygeocoposts10212173351023813?pnrefstory and share your own story in the comments below. What kind of challenges are you currently facing? How far have you come? What are you suffering from right now?I begin a DBT partial inpatient program on January 16th and I'm trying to make it through every day leading up to that date.Thank you again for everything this subreddit has provided in allowing me to pursue selflove and a sense of peace. It's a long road I'm told but today I feel present and capable.,Bipolar
45444,45440,Three strikes and out Had total of four treatments. Recovery from each was progressively worse. Paranoia anxiety extreme memory loss to the point I couldn't recognize wife or children. Ended up in locked room as the paranoid me became the angry me. I knew something was wrongs I literally felt short circuited and lashed out at staff doctors and family. My first and really only memory of this time was ripping plumbing off the sink as I prepared to combat staff? as I wanted the hell out of the nightmare I was living. As crazy as it sounds that was a beginning of my recovery. Today I'm stable but have lost big chunks of memories. Events one normally would never forget. Getting married birth of children paing of family members much less the little events of life that connect so much of who we are. I thank God I had an advocate in my wife that was able to say enough. The docs kept saying just one more just one more. Today I'm stable and my BP is under control through meds. Don't take this treatment lightly. It can have ramifications far and long that aren't always positive. Best of luck T. ,Bipolar
45445,45441,Trying to get pregnant off my meds and falling apart. I need advice from bipolar moms please. Hi everyone. Like the title says I'm off my meds because I'm trying to get pregnant. I thought I could handle it but I'm cycling pretty bad right now. Luckily I'm not suicidal but it took everything I had to get out of bed this morning. In the past two weeks I've been delusional anxious depressed energetic. All over the place. I was diagnosed in 2011 and have been on meds consistantly ever since but my meds were deemed too risky for a pregnancy. Now that I'm in this emotional state I'm questioning my capability to be a mother in the first place. I babysat my 2 year old nephew yesterday and it took every last drop of my energy. I came home so drained I could barely move. I'm assuming it was also compounded with my current mental fluctuations. But it'll only be more of that if I do have kids. Is it possible to find a balance with kids? Will there be time for myself and time for them? Yes I will be getting back on my meds as soon as possible after the baby comes if the baby comes but will it be enough? I'm not even pregnant yet and I feel it might already be too much. I'm sorry for the word vomit I can barely think straight right now.I just want advice from other mothers. How did you do it? How did you survive being off your meds throughout your pregnancy?P.S. I do have an appointment with my therapist at the end of the month she's on vacation.,Bipolar
45449,45445,Bipolar help I was on abilify for months stopped it because I was about to cancel my costly insurance and abilify wasn't really doing anythingfelt the same and the ex cost about 600 a month out of pocket. Now I'm in bed for days haven't showered for weeks this time longer than usual and by the way does anyone have a problem with not showering? What is up with that? The family is in my face about not getting out of bed my dad says he is more depressed than me but gets out of bed. And last night I relapsed and took some of my sisters narc for her wisdom teeth extraction . The mom found out told the Dad and they are so pissed that their middle age daughter that is here with them because of a longer sad story is pulling this pathetic shit and that i owe them to get better already.

45451,45447,Can you be manic with low selfesteem? tw suicide Hey everyoneI just spent a night in a psychiatric assessment unit. Before admitting myself I hadnt slept in 90 hours not because I couldnt but because I didnt feel like I should. I wanted to keep being productive which is interesting because I was also too anxious to do things that I actually need to do reply to emails and texts do work selfcare and hygiene. This resulted in three terrible nights of organizing parts of my room drinking cutting exercising writing and beating my Tetris high score. I created more art and wrote more than I ever have in such short period of time. I kept making plans with friends setting goals etc while fully conscious that I would be too emotionally drained to do any of them the next day which just lead to disappointment. The whole time I was awake I was surging with adrenaline and didnt feel tired. I wasnt getting hallucinations or feeling sluggish like most people report after not sleeping for 3 days. This was especially strange because I usually feel tired after a normal 8 hours of sleep due to low iron plus I was only eating 500 cal a day. Instead I felt alert and was able to do math homework write go to work etc. One weird thing was that my train of thought was totally off..one second I would think Im getting out of the bath in two minutes and immediately follow that with what am I doing in two minutes? or Id be surfing reddit see a recommended website open a new tab then forget what I was doing. The second night I was awake I had this really strong urge to kill myself for about two hours very different from my normal passive I want to die thoughts this was like a primal irrational urge and I then spent the rest of the day totally out of it like my brain was in a different place. I immediately forgot the details of those two hours after they happened so I cant even really describe it in detail. This whole notsleeping episode came right after a few months of feeling extremely depressed unable to perform basic activities or care for myself too anxious to go out or go to classes.Anyways all that to say that I met with a psychiatrist while I was in the unit and she was considering the possibility of bipolar disorder I am already diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression. Bipolar disorder is not something I have ever considered before. She was worried about putting me back on antidepressants in case it triggered more mania. What held her back was that generally you should feel an inflated selfesteem during manic episodes but I didnt feel that at all. I hated myself and felt more suicidal than ever before. So my question is is anyone here bipolar and feels low selfesteem during manic episodes? Is this possible? As a 17 year old going off to uni next year GAD and depression are already enough to deal withI truly hope I do not have BD. But if I do Id like to figure it out ASAP so I can start getting it under control. Thanks for any help!,Bipolar
45476,45472,I think the police are coming Last night I took my normal medication and vitamins for Bipolar I. Then I started the shower on 100 hot. I pulled out. Few other medications just 2ish doses and took them. I just wanted to see what it could feel like. I showered nice and hot I'm a girl so the fires of hell would be comfortable lol then laid down and listens to my playlist. The steamy bathroom and songs I love felt good.My husband woke up at 1am to use the restroom and asked me' what the hell are you doing? Then moved on. I have been hiding this for so long. Thinking and planning and trying to figure things out. On my way to work he told me to drop my attitude and I lost it and told him everything. Everything I've kept secret for 9 months. I told him my final plan and what I'd done.He told me to go home or he'd call the police to my work. So I kept on going to work. He's not my master. But I don't want them to take me. I have a degree in psychology and this isn't my first or fifth run of this. I know what to say to stay out. But this is the first time a family member has called. I don't want to go. It won't help or change how I feel. I have an amazing therapist psychiatrist and Dr. I'm not emotional or desperate. I just don't want to try every day like this. Trying to look and act normal and happy. Yesterday my husband and mother in law told me I'm doing a shit job covering it. So what's the point anyways? I can't hide it. No one wants to hear it. I told my husband I want his support but the only thing he will say is he is calling the police. So maybe they are coming maybe not. ,Bipolar
45494,45490,I think I'm losing it I don't really feel anything. I'm like a zombie just going through the motions. I can smile but it's hard work. The noise of the world has died down and all i hear is my own breathing. I'm winding down like a machine falling apart. I forget what I'm doing and suddenly realise that I've been standing still just looking at nothing for god knows how long.The day before yesterday i almost got hit by a car and I didn't even flinch. I barely registered other people's shocked expressions and just kept going.I think that if the car had hit me I would've flown through the air and crashed to the ground with that detached look on my face still.I usually ride my bike bicycle with my 9 year old in traffic but i think I'd better take the bus for now.I know this is cause for alarm but i really have to force myself to care and take care.

45503,45499,Insights from over two years of custom mood tracking SO MUCH DATA Some background statistics are needed to understand these interpretations and I'll do the most basic explanation I can to make it most accessible while risking misrepresenting it if you want to get pedantic and explain it better in the comments go ahead. The explanations are in the footnotes below. my mood over the past two years has improved slightly but overall stayed about the same. an average mood of 64.76 for 2016 and 64.91 for 2017 that's something. 576 days out of 741 77 of days felt more good than bad. I spent 92 days in the last two years with a mood lower than 40 12 of the 741 days I spent 15 days severely depressed 2 I spent 8 days with strong suicidal feelings and 3 days actively pursuing suicide I spent 159 days with a mood above 80. 57 were in 2017 99 were in 2016 and the remainder were in either 2015 or 2018 for which few days have been recorded. I spent 24 days euphoric mood 90 I spent 8 days on top of the world euphoric moodgt92 my mood had a standard deviation of 18.86 percentage points for 2016 and 15.60 percentage points for 2017 I've gotten more stable. A full time job does that I guess. So does no longer having the tribulations of terminal cancer in your life. my happiest days of the last two years were all in 2016 lower standard deviation suggested as much an emphatic thank you to the redditor behind 81416 being one of them my custom manic rating scale suggests I spent 34 days in 2017 some kind of manic 9.3 and 51 days in 2016 some kind of manic 14 Getting off lowers my stress levels and increases my mood each orgasm reduces my perceived stress by 3 percentage points. with a p value of under .001. With mean stress levels of 35.7 that's about an 8.4 difference per orgasm. Each orgasm also raises my mood by about 3 percentage points for a typical increase of 4.7 per orgasm. each 1 out of 10 point increase in my stress levels increases my anxiety on average by 4 percentage points. With mean anxiety levels of 28 that's a 14 difference per point. the effects of alcohol on my mood are unclear. My mood tracker strongly suggests Plt.001 I drink more when I feel good but the direction of causality here is likely such that I drink because I feel good rather than because it makes me feel good. The data isn't of a nature that can tell me how it affects me during the duration of alcohol. It's clear there isn't sufficient evidence to strongly support the hypothesis that alcohol makes me in particular depressed. sleep plays a highly significant role in minimizing stress and anxiety with p values of .01 and .03 respectively and meaningful correlation coefficients. weed improves my mood by .624 percentage points per level of rtrees highness scale. with a p value of .019 and a mean mood of 64.84 that's about a 1 improvement per point of highness. At a total high that's a 10 increase in mood and a very high likelihood of experiencing some psychosis. At a moderate high that might be a 5 increase in mood. In other words weed definitely improves my mood overall but at level other factors are still very important. It's worth noting that the percentage increase in mood is different based on the baseline mood if I'm at a suicidal depression typical such mood around 15 1 is most suicidal ever on my scale a 10 point increase in mood is actually an increase in mood of 67. I actually used weed the last time I was suicidal to get out of those feelings and it helped me. Weed is risky and makes some of us psychotic and can make us depressed. Use it with caution if at all. weed increases my sleep. with an average night's sleep lasting 7.96 hours and an increase of .045 hours per point of the rtrees highness scale for a very strong high increasing my hours slept by a half hour this is probably weaker than it should be because of an alarm weed impairs my cognition. p value lt.002 weed causes me psychosis with a p value of less than .001. Typically the psychosis hasn't been severe so it's something I've continued. It's not helping me but that's why they call it a vice. I drank a bit more in 2017 than 2016 thanks to a bender around July where I learned to cope with boredom better 1.24 drinks per day vs 1.1 drinks per day but I've had two drinks in 2018 for an average of .18 drinks per day. I intend to drink again but I'm giving my liver a break for the time being.P value is most basically explained as the likelihood of occurring due to chance with 1 meaning 100 and 0 meaning couldn't randomly occur at all I know this isn't quite right but this is a simplification. R squared is how well an algorithm explains the data. a high r squared means a regression has high explanatory power. 1 is a perfect fit 0 is no fit. Beta is the strength of a correlation. If my mood is measured on a 100 point scale and one unit of sleep changes my mood by 6 points then sleep would have a beta of 6. Standard deviation is a descriptor for the amount of variation in a data set. If everything is close to average it's got a low standard deviation. If everything is very disparate it will have a high SD.Edit thought I had percent and percentage point confused somewhere but was wrong so I fixed it twice oops.Edit 2 I wanted to share it but was feeling too worn out to set up a new one for you guys but uglitterbeast reminded me I posted about it before and had a dropbox saved file for ithttpswww.reddit.comrBipolarRedditcomments6mmchnmakingamoodtrackerhowididitwhyyoumight. I updated the one I linked in the description there to make it more likely to output possible mania as it seemed to fail at this corrected an error that was getting in the way of accurate alcoholrelated depression results and changed the dates to be for 2018Edit 3 the biggest thing I might change for yourself if I was you would be the role of your sex drive in your manic rating. Most people don't keep the same baseline libido as I do and plenty of people don't have their libido as a very strong indicator of mania.,Bipolar
45512,45508,Not bipolar. Asking for advice about my daughters mother who is bipolar. Hi. Need to clarify that I am using my wife's account to ask this question. I'm not a person who likes or enjoys social media I'm an old fart so please understand I'm only borrowing her account for this. Thank you. I hope someone can help me out with something I need to know. When my ex daughters mom is dealing with a common cold or flu she tends to go into almost a bipolar mania with borderline psychotic actions. She lashes out verbally and sadly physically. Last time a week ago she physically went after our 10 year old daughter. I had to drive to her house after my daughter called me terrified locked in the bathroom as her mother was kicking at the door. I have my daughter now getting her therapy and have a 3 year no contact order for my daughter and I against her mother. So when my ex gets sick with normal winter illnesses why does she spiral downward like this.? Then she blames anyone and everyone that it was there fault. My daughter was asked if she could go and get her mother a glass of water and my daughter said ok but could you please wait a few minutes so I can finish up my last bit of homework. Normally anyone would be ok thank you but not my ex. She started breaking things and basically telling our daughter that she doesn't care about mom and doesn't care about mom being sick and then into saying what did I ever do to you to make you hate me just a glass of water and you couldn't even be responsible and respectful enough to go get it. Now my daughter is not a child that yells back or gets defiant yet lol she's at least 2 years away from the hormones and my daughter is very soft spoken and would help anyone who asked. Complete opposite of my ex thank the heavens. Plus my ex goes off and on meds for the last 14 years. She says she doesn't have a problem and if she did meds cure it and ya da all gone. Please help me understand the correlation between bipolar and coldsflus with a person who cycles back and forth and refuses meds then goes back on for roughly a month no more than that every few years. Thank you Update edit For the record I don't plan on keeping the PFA order no contact for 3 years. That's what the judge ruled. I just wanted it for 3 months but with supervised visits for a few weeks leading into an actual custody order for my ex to have our daughter 5050. But because ex was arrested swinging at a cop and it was neighbors who called unbeknownst to me until the next day the judge ruled this way. Yes I wanted to just get her out of my daughters life because I was extremely angry for a few years. It was for me. Not my daughter. It was so I could feel better. Thanks to my wife she's changed my view on how it shouldn't be a selfish want or desire. I had to think about my daughter AND my ex and how it wouldn't be a good thing for either of them if I stopped their relationship. So I apologize to everyone on here for being a jerk. My wife said I was being one lol ,Bipolar
45531,45527,That burning passion... I'm sitting here in my living room watching the log in my fireplace slowly burn. There's something oddly therapeutic about this and I'm not exactly sure what.I was an angry kid. Just... I was BAD. There was so obviously a problem but not one they could really do anything about. You can't really help a kid whose primary problem is thinks everyone wants to hurt him. Doctors tried to fit me into these neat little diagnostic labels even though nothing ever really fit. They tried to give me all these medications even though nothing ever really worked. And when I only got worse this only confirmed my original hypothesis.I'm still angry. At a society that doesn't believe victims of child abuse sexual assault violence... ANYTHING. I'm angry that I was given such a rough hand. Some might call this a sense of entitlement whatever that means Other people have it worse! said the betteroff person. But... fuck. I'm not demanding anything other than wanting to stay alive.I know what I need to do. I need to find a psychiatrist. A therapist. Probably a medication change. I've just been dealing with so much shit in my life that I've completely neglected my mental health. I've pretty much destroyed myself just trying to survive. Because I've been doing it all on my own and it's just... too much right now.A few years ago I heard someone describe anger as a motivating force. I never understood this. To me anger has only been a force of destruction... not unlike fire. If my anger is a small spark my brain's reaction to feeling it is the equivalent of dousing it with gasoline.Yet kept in a small confined area with a watchful eye a fire can keep you warm. It can be a light in the dark. It serves a purpose. Fuck sometimes it's just beautiful. And if I have a choice I'm not going to freeze to death or live my life in the dark.I didn't even know where I was going with this post when I started. Strange how you can find meaning in everything around you.,Bipolar

45557,45553,Citalopram for Bipolar 2 intense Depression? Have you tried it? Hey friendsSo I've had a BP 2 diagnosis for many many years. I was extremely badly depressed towards the beginning I suppose you could call it. At the time Lamictal helped me beyond my wildest expectations. It gave me many years of being able to live and work productively.Fast forward to the present. I have been ultradian cycling for a few months. Basically my illness has progressed and is keeping me from working or even doing basic things. So I turned to my pdoc for help. Despite the chance that an antidepressant may have to flip me into hypomania the risk is worth it right now. I've started Celexa Citalopram which lists its purposes as intended for Major Depressive Disorder Generalized Anxiety Disorder PTSD maybe another thing or two.Has anyone had experience with Citalopram alongside a mood stabilizer? I'm extremely down and hoping for any help here.,Bipolar

I think its rapid cycling bipolar based on genes and extreme episodes over this past year. I have kids. They need their mom. I need me back.

I miss being super happy when i'm manic because it's a lot better than the depression. i am on lamictal and latuda right now and the latuda is ruining my life. i think about suicide everyday to make myself feel better but i know that's not an option because i can't hurt my family. i have akathesia from the latuda and i also have this feeling like i'm not a person. i don't want to hang out with my friends or anyone anymore and i'm always stressed out and depressed. i'm slowly getting off of the latuda since it is ruining any happiness i could possibly have but each day that goes by i want to kill myself even more. if anyone has any advice for me that'd be great because i can't seem to find anything that makes me feel better. ,Bipolar

Especially when I'm depressed which is the majority of the time. I have countless examples of things that have been blown out of proportion by my avoidance. I know stuff doesn't just go away but I can't seem to handle anything anymore. Then it snowballs until something like this happens.,Bipolar
45639,45634,I Found What I Was Looking For I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in April 2012. I've struggled with the illness since I was twelveyearsold and initially I was diagnosed with unipolar depression. I've been hospitalized more than ten times. I've been suicidal countless times. Without my medication I experience so many manic breakdownsbreakdowns that are terrifying. I came to terms with my illness in October 2016 after losing someone that I love with all my heart. When this person severed our relationship I realized that I needed my medication to make the paranoia the delusions and the recklessness go away. It was through this loss that I saw the light. But it was as of recently that I realized the way I treated people and myself and my perspective in life was also unacceptable. I have a strong support network but I disclosed everything under the sun to anyone who would listen which is not good for anyone's selfesteem. I was the proverbial empty barrel that made noiseall the contents of my barrel would spill out into the ocean that is life. I was unable to love myself so I sought that love in others. I revealed everything about myself in the hope that someone else could soothe my pain only to scare away people that just wanted a healthy relationship with me. I am sharing my story because medication saved me from the mania but it was mindfulness that saved me from myself. I realized all the love I need is within myself and that I don't need to turn to others to soothe my emotions when meditation coupled with medication can lead one to find the peace and bliss we are all looking for. ,Bipolar

45657,45652,Hypomanic phaseshypersexualitysocial suicide disclaimer I understand that this post is insanely long but I feel condensing it will dilute its message. Some of this is unrelated to my bipolar II but it still plays a central role in my issue so I felt this would be the best place to post this plus I don't know where else to post. Little new here. I've been suffering from the symptoms of bipolar II along with social anxiety since my early teens so throughout middlehigh school it crippled me socially. My rapid awkward allovertheplace speech in my hypomanic phases and my mumbly confused speech in depressive phases if I even spoke at all along with anxiety kept me from really connecting with anyone and i was never able and still am not very able to display my true self something that crushesdepresses me to this day. It also SERIOUSLY held me back academicallyathletically. I was a straightA student with a promising competitive swimming career up until around 9th grade when my disorder had grown to an unmanageable level due to it going untreated and it continued to for the rest of high school with my relatively strict parents calling it bullshit at every turn and never getting me in any counseling or put on any meds until i dropped out of college at 18. Only then did they listen and see an issue. Knowing that I never realized my potential in any area of my life sends me flying into bouts of extreme depressive episodes in which I cry over what could have been and it can last days. I only thought I had depression at this point so I was misdiagnosed for another year. Now at 20 I am finally diagnosed properly and on a mood stablizier although it hasn't been particulary effective and smoking weed and dropping acid probably doesn't help matters. But I must admit that my first couple trips allowed me to take inventory and understand that I've been bouncing between manicdepressive phases since childhood and that my issue quite possibly extends into sex addictionhypersexuality. And it brought certain behaviors and memories to the surface that I wasn't willing to face and it's a big reason why I'm even here posting this I DO NOT condone the use of LSD especially for the people on this subreddit. Now we get to the main point that the title addresses not sure if I had to give ya'll my life story first.Throughout my adolescent life a common theme has been my complete and utter lack of control of my sexual impulses resulting in shameful behavior that I keep buried away from many public masturbation. At the beach with a towel over me in the nearest public bathroom and even IN CLASS. I knew it was disgusting as I was doing it but simply HAD to get off constantly like some nympho. I could only dart to the bathroom throughout the day so many times our monthly hall passes gave us a limited number of times to leave class. After reflecting I feel that this urge was aggravated by a combination of my hypomanic phases which involves being too horny and my hypersexuality bringing my sex drive to an INSANE level. If this is the case then it would explain that behavior. It doesn't justify it but it gives insight into how this happened. And teachers did NOTHING to address it. Unless the kid's autistic I would have confronted me about it if I were in their shoes and it may have gotten me the help I needed sooner. Because they turned a blind eye it continued to fester and get worse. I understand that it's not their job to counsel me but such extreme behavior warrants attention I was very sick and nobody helped me. There is one exception in which we were watching a movie in class a year after I discontinued my inclass meatbeating. A risque scene comes on and my teacher promply says Ok settle down John. to which the class erupts into the most intense laughter I've ever heard that rings in my ears to this day. So if anything they made it worse. I quickly became known as that creepy kid that beat it in the back of class bc well.... I WAS that creepy kid that beat it in the back of class. I never stared at some chick's ass to set it off mind you if anything I blocked out the world to focus on my animalistic impulses. So if anyone wants to call me a gross creep save it bc I'm already aware But this realization that it may not have been my fault that I'm not a complete pervert really makes me feel better and could bring me at peace but I feel I cannot confirm it without getting some outside opinions and I don't want to go to anyone else friends family etc. other than my psychiatrist bc I'm so shameful of it and I fear they would look at me different for the rest of my life. I've just been hurting for such a long time and I'm desperate to get answers about this bc I'm too hung up on it and I likely will continue to be until I come to peace with it.Thanks,Bipolar
45665,45660,First week on Lamictal and it's giving me memory problems. Does it ever end? I started meds for the very first time last week and I'm really excited for the future. My doctor gave me Lamictal and it's great. I can tell its already working because I'm not getting extremely depressed or extremely manic I feel balanced. But I'm getting really bad memory problems and it's to the point where I drive and forget where I'm going. Currently I'm taking one 25mg per day and tomorrow I will have to take two pills each day and work my way up until I have to take 100mg per day. I definitely love the effects but the side effects are frustrating. Has anyone had any experience with this? Did it ever go away?,Bipolar
45684,45679,Started Trileptal. Any thoughts on how to manage side effects? Hi! I was recently diagnosed with bipolar. I was previously on Lamictal but I got hives on my feet and elbows that started spreading. So my psychiatrist changed me to Trileptal 300 mg morning and night. I was wondering how do y'all deal with the side effects? What are the side effects you've experienced?I know that I should be thankful that mood stabilizers are working but I really don't know how to cope with how tired I feel. And I'm afraid of the acne side effect. Skincare is one of the only hobbies I really enjoy and it makes me super sad that something that helps me feel stable could interfere with the hobbies I care about. ,Bipolar
45697,45692,Experiences with Lamictal and hypomania? Experiences getting off Lamictal? Hi! This is my first time posting here. If I may do any of you have experiences with what I put in my title?Here's some not super necessary for answering my questions backgroundI have a diagnosis of Bipolar type 2. While for many reasons I still believe this to be accurate I've been questioning the role that Lamictal has played in my illness and diagnosis.While I had had many sort of hypohypomanic periods before and had actually been diagnosed before at age 13 my first full blown classically symptomatic hypomanic episode coincided with starting and then increasing my dose of Lamictal. This particular episode was used as a part of my diagnosis. I started Lamictal due to a severe upswing in my depression and history of not responding to antidepressants. The hypomania eventually faded back into my more typical depressions and general emotional static. This was then further complicated by the addition of other meds that I did not do well with at all. It's a bit of a tangle so attempting to determine if there's any sort of clear chain of cause and effect is difficult.I've never had any other side effects but I've also never really felt any steadier on Lamictal. Lithium is what eventually became a total godsend for me.All of this is to say that I don't know if Lamictal has actually done anything positive for me. Yet I've been kept on it ever since and I'm questioning if this is only because I haven't had any side effects to complain about. If this is true is there really any point to continuing to take it long term? If I don't have to spend the money every month and continue to risk the known short term and unknown long term side effects I'd rather not.So has anyone else experienced hypomania that coincided with starting or increasing Lamictal? Has anyone gone through getting off of it? What is the process of doing that like?I am of course not going to change anything without talking to my pdoc. I'd just like to hear from some other people with personal insight.Thank you!,Bipolar
45734,45729,As experts in psychiatry what do you think about my sex life? The last year has been chaotic but the next is looking stable and positive. The next priority is going to be repairing my bond with my husband. I basically shut down to emergency mode for a few months due to job loss and massive anxiety. Hubby took excellent care of me and the household during that time. Unfortunately as I was coming out of it he was heading into a pretty hefty depression. All of this on top of some asyetunresolved body image issues developed no pun intended from my wedding pictures. I've been worried and I think hubby too that we've wandered into platonic territory and I really want to reel that back. Hubby's depression is currently covering the fact that I'm having a hard time reengaging with him but I think the problem is mine because of my reaction to the wedding photos making me feel extremely unsexy rather than being createdcaused by him. Any ideas about how to feel sexy again? ,Bipolar
45740,45735,Boy did I screw up Wow. Did I mess up. A little background. Diagnosed as bipolar at 18 after a difficult junior high and high school experience. Struggled throughout my early 20s and finally got my life under control by my late 20s. Met an amazing woman and got married. Managed to find a meaningful career and had a few years of amazing success. Two wonderful kids. About 4 years ago my career started going south. There are several reasons one of which was a move to different state then most of my freelance work. My wife also got very sick when pregnant with our second child and I ended up getting into a bad pattern of care taking without taking care of myself. Especially when it came to sleep. As the money stopped coming in I started selling some stocks that I owned prior to our relationship. I ended up selling almost all of it and cashing out the majority of our small but important IRA over the course of 23 years. I never shared any of this with my wife and never reported any of the money as income. Fast forward to 2017. Almost all of the stock is gone and I still havent told anyone. We are practically broke and borrowing money from family members repeatedly. A few weeks ago my wife demanded access to my brokerage account. She decided the best way to fix our finances was for her to take complete control. The jig was up. My huge violation of trust was revealed. I truly believe that deep down I am a good person. I have a good heart and I am a very caring and loving father and husband. But with my terrible actions and hiding and lying about it it is clear that I am sick and need help. I dont know what caused this manic episode but I am sure the fact that I sleep 56 hours a night so she can get a full 810 hours of sleep every day didnt help. She says she loves me but hates my guts right now. She says she loves me but is terrified and feels like unsafe. She says she doesnt know if she can stand to have me in the house or will ever be able to see me as a romantic partner again. I havent been in therapy since my psych died in 2011. Ive been seeing a nurse practitioner once every three months to keep my prescriptions up. But clearly need to find a new doctor pronto and get intensive therapy. Not just medication management. If I didnt have children I cant imagine what Id do to myself. But I love them and I love her so much. I know I have a chronic illness and this is a major flare up. I just cant imagine how I can live without my family.We are seeing a couples therapist next week. I am so ashamed of my actions and my lying. Im not sure what to do. ,Bipolar
45751,45746,I had to quit my job Rant incoming. I just need to get this out and share. I'm medicated and pretty well stable for the last 5 years. My job was so incredibly stressful the last few months. I was coming home every day with no energy to cook dinner or clean and mostly just spending my evenings watching tv and or crying. I didn't know what to do. There's an extra element of stress to a stressful job when you're bipolar as I don't know if the job is really the problem or if I'm going into an episode. My 1up manager was away on a Friday so I spoke to my 2up manager and said I wasn't coping with the stress and would like to hand in my resignation. I didn't ask for any special treatment just offered my resignation. He asked me to just think about it for the weekend and we'd discuss it again on the Monday. On the Monday he brought my 1up into the discussion. They offered me some leniencies and said they'd figured the job might actually be a 2 person job back when they hired me and they'd reassess the business plan and asked if I'd be happy to stay if the job was cut in half. I said I couldn't offer a commitment but I'd be willing to try. At the end of that week I heard from one of my colleagues that my 1 up had told him that I spat the dummy and didn't want to do the hard work anymore. I was furious. I was humiliated. Not only was my supposedly confidential conversation with management not confidential but it was totally changed to make me look like a whiner. I spoke to my partner and he agreed this was not on and that I need to get out of that place. So I took a week of stress leave sick leave officially. During my week off sick I received 47 not a typo! calls from work from people expecting me to do things and make decisions. While I was sick! I realised the only time I was badly stressed during that week was when I woke up and had that instant dread of thinking I had to go to work and when I received a call. Otherwise I felt ok. I called up on the last day and resigned. Today is my 5th day of unemployment and I am so so happy. I feel almost back to normal again. I still get stressed if I think about having to apply for jobs but that's ok because I've decided to give myself at least 6 weeks off to decompress from that stressful job before I start looking again. The point of this message no job is worth more than your mental health. Save money! Be prepared to be unemployed for a while if you need to because shitty jobs will come along and you need to be able to get out. I've never in my life been so happy to have some savings and I don't mind if I blow through it all over the next 6 months. I'm just happy to be out.,Bipolar

ANYHOW...I know the symptoms and I have been waiting to make sure it wasnt in my head or simple dehydration before going to the doctor. Today is Saturday and thankfully his practice is open on weekends. I havent called yet but I will when they open. The pain is worse this morning.And then I realized that every time I get a cold I recheck the symptoms of the flu pneumonia etc. in order to rule those things out.If I get a rash I will look up different rashes to make sure its not some flesh eating bacteria. I had shingles behind my knees last year and wrote it off as dermatitis and didnt go to see my doctor until it hurt too much to walk.I guess Im sort of the opposite. I try to rule out worse illnesses? But then I thought hey maybe thats how you justify it but youre a hypochondriac silly.Except when it comes to UTIs. I know every symptom Ive experienced.,Bipolar

Not to be the CEO lol just to follow my dreams in an environment that is beneficial for me intelectually.But then again I took the interview when I was on the low phase and now the excitement has triggered my hypomania.

I hope I am not a liability but I feel like it when I take bad decisions because I am hypomanic when I can't express myself clearly for the same reasons when I do weird things etc.Tomorrow is my first day of training. I am pondering if I should double my antipsychotic dose got approval to do it when I am not well from my pdoc or just go there as I am and deal with my mood stay focused no matter how much effort that takes.I need to be stronger than I think I ever was. More disciplined than I honestly think it is possible for me. I just met my own limits and I am so very scared.,Bipolar
45797,45792,Getting out of the house while feeling like shit Had grocery shopping to do..one of my least favorite things when I'm depressed. I pulled into a dollar store parking lot spot and noticed a car behind me wanting me to pull forward into the spot ahead of me making my car backwards so they could pull in and have my primo spot. I was parked correctly already parked and I wasn't going to pull forward. The lady sat there for 4 mins waiting for me. She finally sped off and went around the parking lot to the other side to pull into the spot she wanted me to go in and gave me the meanest glare. At this point my adrenaline kicked in and I gave her a thumbs up with a huge grin. I don't have time for weird shit and I'm not going to let someone bully out of my spot. But anyway she waited in her car for me to get out. She was twice my size and looked like she was going to kill me. Needless to I stayed in the car and ended up leaving because I didn't need a scene in front of my kids or harm done. The adrenaline on the other hand has kicked off a good sensation and for the time today I don't feel sad. Thank you scary lady for the uplift. ,Bipolar
45799,45794,Just had worst case scenario with Topiramate do yourself a favor dont take take it Im now tapering off and I cant believe Im still alive. The last 4 weeks of being on this drug I can only describe as trauma actual PTSD nausea inducing flashbacks and it makes me queasy even to write. Its therapeutic to rant but mostly Im just so frightened to try any other drug ever again. It made me aggressively suicidal if anyone is thinking of trying this drug and wants more details ama Ive already been on the basics I feel lithium seroquel lamictal saphris. Lithium I was on for many yrs and was ok but then something changed. I kinda just wanna try just not being sedated Ive had a few windows now between drugs and now that Ive been to literal hell and back on this drug I feel I have this new found grit. Do you guys have any different drug recommendations? Or how do you get the courage to try another one? Any one have any success going drug free after lithium? ,Bipolar
45805,45800,I feel ashamed about the dumb stuff I said whilst hypomanic So I am in a hypomanic episode and looking back on the things I said and did I feel so embarrassed. My parents are away so only my maid was there and I still managed to tell her weird secrets and proceeded to show her all my dumb drawings of my imaginary boyfriend as well as showing her all the shows not really a show but a game that has many stories that I watch and pointing out which guy Im in love with. I have no clue why I done this! I feel deeply ashamed for doing this and revealing personal secrets. I also yelled at my grandma she did deserve it but I should have just hanged up the call complained about my mum and stepdad to my maid grandpa grandma and biological father. I also went and bought lots of random cooking stuff and makeup that doesnt suit me so now I have to return it. And I bought 3 bags of cereal. I am not even allowed cereal by mum. No clue why I bought it. So yeah...P.S. For any people who are going to be like go get a diagnosis and meds and this wont happen I dont want to right now. I have nothing to gain from just getting diagnosed and while I do want meds one day I will wait until I have kids because I dont want to take pills when Im pregnant and apparently withdrawal symptoms are horrible. Also Im scared of the side effect of gaining weight.Whats the weirdestmost embarrassingmost regrettable thing you did when hypomanic? Did you apologiseexplain afterwards that you had bipolar?,Bipolar
45817,45812,Has anyone here had any experience with legally taking time off high school? Hello everyone! I'm a high school student who was a month ago diagnosed with Bipolar II. I'd been having depressive episodes for about a year and a month and a half ago started experiencing manic episodes as well which was the reason why I decided to see a doctor. I'm still very early in my treatment don't yet have a psychiatrist and won't for another month or two thanks American health insurance and I've been having a really hard time coping. I've always been a very high achieving student getting straight A's every semester and doing my best not to miss school. This year however has been different. Due to my Bipolar Disorder I've now missed a month of school have had to drop 3 classes and I really don't know what to do at this point. My mental health takes top priority so I am certainly not planning on sacrificing my health and safety for school. I'm feeling really hopeless and lost and balancing school work and my illness just isn't possible anymore. I plan on going to college next year but I'm afraid that my absences and now failing grades are going to affect my ability to get scholarships. I really just need to take this year off without droppingout so I can get the help I need. I was wondering if anyone here has any advice or similar experiences. I live in New York in case that matters. Sorry for the wall of text.,Bipolar

HOWEVER i do sing a lot all through the night. would this be the equivalent? can anxiety override hypomania? i find it pretty hard to figure out my symptoms given that i'm never around other people. it's like my symptoms never reach their full potential because there's no external stimulation. does that make sense? sorry if this has been asked before.,Bipolar

45893,45887,Upped the dosage on my meds and now everything feels really really wrong. I feel like I did when I was at my worst I've been on 100 mg lamictal and recently upped it to 150 eventually supposed to get to 200. I don't know for sure that what I'm feeling is because of the meds. I don't think lamictal is strong enough to get a reaction like this the impression I got is that it's mild or something but I also don't know anything about how meds actually work. It's like I have an electric current going through me I can't close my eyes and I can't sleep. I'm starting to get irritated like I did before and crying a lot and getting that bone deep sorrow for no real reason. Everything's turned up to eleven and I really do feel like I'm crazy like the way it felt before I got diagnosed. I'm scared because I'm feeling that zero inhibitions I can do anything kind of mood and this is when I feel most like I could go through with it,Bipolar

45916,45910,Latuda 60mgs Lamictal just startedworking way up to 100mgs Lexapro 15mgs 2x a day Buspirone 15mgs 2x a day and weight gain Let it be said that I work out with a personal trainer 3x a week. My job is sedentary office job but I have a standing desk which I've just recently started standing at after lunch break. I'm doing the whole Keto diet for a year and granted I haven't been a saint on it I've had cheat meals on weekends and little treats here and there also used to drink but have cut that out and used to smoke but quit that as well but for the most part have been keeping my carbs under 50g per day and ideally I want it to be at 25g or under. My caloric restriction is at 1425 I'm female 5'4 and last month I weighed myself at 147lbs. I started off last year being at 137lbs before working out 3x per day and before being switched around between many different antipsychoticsBipolar 2 which is MUCH more ideal and my goal weight is 125130lbs. I understand it's going to take time...but I'm becoming impatient. I religiously write down everything that goes into my mouth and count my macros. My weight has done nothing but go up and I understand muscle weighs more than fat but I have a pudgy stomach full face and I can't seem to go down in weight. I will be more than happy to provide a weekly macro sheet if that would help any of you but I'm desperate for any advice suggestions or just telling me to calm the fuck down and just be patient .

45929,45923,Abilify is scaring me So recently I was 'diagnosed' by a psychiatrist. I see a psychologist these days we really just talk about things and I don't find that particularly helpful. I swing between horrible depression and even worse panic attacksspells of psychosis. I used to drink to 'level' myself out but in the past 4 years that really hasn't helped things and just made the psychosis worse. Also my current gf has a flat 'no drinking' policy.Anyway after 6 months being on the waiting list at the ONLY place my GP would refer me too I was given a 1 hour assessment and a script for abilify. I have a long LONG history of eating disorders along with the alcohol abuse. This past 13 months I have gone from being a happy 78kg I'm 6ft 2 to a huge 115Kg because I don't have my crutch of alcohol anymore.I'm scared of abilify. I just took my first dose. I'm terrified of the weight gain. When I was 16 I was put on seroquel and I blew up like a baloon which STARTED my crippling ED bullshit. I told all this to my psych and he assured me that Abilify was 'completely side effect free' and 'weight neutral' but my pharmacist was flabbergasted and told me I could expect a similar trail to Seroquel?So toss the meds and get a second opinion? Or is it not as scary as all that? Can anyone tell me they've had ANY positive experiences with atypical antipsychotics? ,Bipolar

45950,45944,Looking for insight. My dad has struggled with bipolar since his teens. He's 60 now and I'm 36. I have some trauma from my childhood because of his manic episodes in which he became violent. I can remember at least 3 episodes where he had psychosis. My parents divorced but lived together on and off for years. Apparently my dad's doctor released him and said he was cured and didn't need any more treatment 10 years ago or so my mom tells me.Well fast forward to this past Thursday my dad had an episode of psychosis following days of mania and there was a lot of alcohol involved. He apparently hallucinated that my mom was screaming at him and being horrible to him and he's hospitalized right now. The police found him wandering the streets at 5am. I saw him Friday morning in the emergency room and he was still babbling on and on rocking back and forth and seemed to be scared of something I think demons possibly from what he was babbling about. Well he was given a shot and moved to the crisis center in the local hospital. I visited him today and finally got him to sign a release stating his doctors can talk to me. But he still believes that my mother was screaming at him and doing horrible things to him which are not true.I let him tell me all of this and my mom was there visiting too. I didn't say much because I needed him to trust me. He thinks there is nothing wrong with him and claims the doctors told him that he is fine and not bipolar at all and they've given him pills to calm him down. My mom said he can't come home and she wants nothing to do with him ever again and all of his care is in my hands now.Mostly I'm just venting here. I want to tell him he was hallucinating but he still isn't well so I'm guessing that's not a great idea. I feel he will come around and realize he was hallucinating but I don't know how bipolar works. I don't know what's going to happen to him now. ,Bipolar
45961,45955,300mg Lithium enough for BPII maintenance? My doctor started me on 300mg day in 2015 and in 2016 increased to 600mg at my request. It was my first time getting treatment for BP specifically and it helped me get to the stable place I am at now. However I am suffering side effects related to lithium weight gain acne diarrhea memoryfocus issues dry skin drowsinessslugishness and want to reduce my dose back to 300mg. I am now taking 400mg lamotrigine so I feel like that should be stable.However I can't find much research on levels that low. I'm meeting with my doctor next week but in the meantime just reduced it and feeling more alive. I asked my partner and a friend to let me know if it seems like I am starting to get hypomanic. I hope that this can be stable because it feels nice to lose the bogged down feeling. I want to be vigilant about distinguishing the feeling of a good mood from hypomania. Does anyone have experience with low dose lithium and or cultivating selfawareness about good stable moods vs hypomania?,Bipolar

I got a really good vibe from her during our first meeting last month. She spent over an hour with me and really listened and then presented a measured plan of changing up meds.I think the new meds are working as I feel more like myself lately than I have in a long time. I saw the pdoc again today and my good vibes were confirmed. I think she can really help me. I brought in a print out from the mood tracker app I have been using which I learned about from you guys and she praised me for being a perfect patient lol.

45972,45966,I gave up my old career in return for a happier healthier life. I went to medical school as a healthy bright 18 year old but within the first year I had my first major depressive episode and suicide attempt. At 19 I had my first manic phase a month long binge with multiple sexual partners drug use and irrepressible urges to study all night. Spontaneous and irresponsible acts were my forte I decided that Morocco was my spirit country and whisked myself off the next day. I gained a reputation amongst my friends as mercurial and fun but inside I was imploding my second suicide attempt followed the month after.In my mind the problem was Medicine. This stressful hypercompetitive environment was obviously causing my mood swings no way was this an organic health problem. So I left med school at the beginning of 4th year and began teaching Maths and I was great at it! This career change had solved all of my problems and I was tippety top flying high fantastic! Life couldn't get better right?Wrong. The depression came back harder than ever sending me spiralling down into a deep dark chasm. I was admitted to hospital and diagnosed properly treated and sent on my way a month later armed with mood stabilisers CBT worksheets and a new found passion for yoga. I thought I could just ride the wave surfing with the sun on my face when times were good and paddling against the tide when times got bad. I never imagined I'd be dragged under again.But I was. The stress of teaching caught up. The long hours the constant need to be 'on' and engaging the marking the data tracking the free time spent planning the expectations the meetings they slowly pulled me down until I was drowning exhausted from fighting the tide and ready to accept defeat.But three months ago I stopped fighting. I left teaching and I felt the wave pull me up lifting me toward the surface. Each day that I got up was a victory that brought me closer to sunlight. I chose to leave behind the stress that was threatening my survival and anchoring me to the ocean floor and I put myself first. In a few weeks time I start a job working part time as an activities coordinator for the same psychiatric hospital group that I was admitted as an inpatient to. I tutor for an online company and I'm happy.I'm not dipping and diving on the surf with the wind rushing past but I'm not inhaling salty foam beneath the surface either.

45995,45989,Have been taking Lexapro 10mg for past 4 days. Feeling like my depression is gone since yesterday. Not sure if it's Lexapro or if it might be a hypomanic or a manic phase.Xpost from rdepression I'm not sure if crossposting is allowed. Here is the link to my original posthttpswww.reddit.comrdepressioncomments87a00bhavebeentakinglexapro10mgforpast4days on rdepression. TLDR Not sure what type of depressive disorderPDD Smiling Depression SAD Cyclothymia or Bipolar 2 I have. My psychiatrist started me Lexapro 10mg and based on how it goes he said we could try switching to mood support meds. I've been taking Lexapro since Thursday and I've been feeling like my depression is gone since yesterday. I'm worried I might be in a hypomanic or a manic phasegot told by my psychiatrist that Lexapro elevates the mania and asked me not to take it if I'm in a hypomanic or manic phase.I met my psychiatrist last Thursday and we talked about my depression. I've always had ups and downs in my life for a few years. But I always thought it was because of my actions that caused then and not the other way around. I'm still not sure what type of depressive disorder I have. Since I had like 2 weeks time before my appointment I did a bit of research reading about the depression types and how each of them is different in their own way. So I told my psychiatrist that I wasn't sure if had the persistent depressive disorder seasonal affective depression smiling depression or Cyclothymiaaka bipolar lite.When I was doing my research and if there was something relatable to me or if something similar has happened to me before I noted them down as a list. We talked about how I identified that I was depressed and all the points on the list. Then he told me that even he wasn't sure if I had Dysthymia smiling depression bipolar 2 or cyclothymia. So as a general procedure he said that he is going to prescribe me meds to help with depression and if it doesn't work he is going to prescribe me mood support meds for cyclothymia or bipolar 2. He prescribed Lexapro 10mg to take every morning and asked me to get back to him in 2 weeks about how the meds were working. He also warned me not to take Lexapro if I feel like I have a hypomanic or a manic phase as it might elevate the mania. I've been taking Lexapro since Thursday and I've been feeling like I'm not depressed since yesterday. I was not sure if it's my hypomanic phase and I didn't take my meds today.So these were the differences that I noticed in me yesterday compared to the day before I feel fresh more energetic and I feel like I got back my motivation to do things. I've been procrastinating to buy my vitamins for a week and I ordered them yesterday I still have vitamins for the next couple of days I smoked close to double the number of cigarettes than I did during the past few days I was clenching my jaw more than usual and today morning I had a little pain in my enamel I've been hitting my bed at 12ish and could sleep only by around 4 or 5 in the morning and I slept for around 4 hours for the past couple of weeks. I started using melatonin for last week and it helped me get to sleep by 12. I used to sleep for 10 to 11 hours on melatonin. But last night I didn't take melatonin. I went to bed at 12 and slept in a few mins and woke up at approx 8. I planned my family's trip to the US have been wanting to do this for weeks I could never stay interested in a single topic for more than 10 mins max. I watched the entire Dota 2 loregasm playlist by SirActionSlacks. It has 12 videos and it took around 3.5 hours to finish. I watched the whole thing without any break. I completed the tax return process on Sprintax. I still have to take a printout and mail it but I got my w2 and access to Sprintax like more than a month ago and I've been procrastinating to finish it. Finally I usually don't write this long posts if I'm not on Adderall diagnosed with ADHD but I'm not on Adderall now.I want to wait a couple of days to talk to my psychiatrist about this. Before that I just wanted to make sure if it's Lexapro or a hypomanic or manic phase.,Bipolar

46050,46044,Accepting bipolar and getting medicated First time posting here. Actually I made a post earlier and deleted it because it was long. I am diagnosed BP1 mixed episodes rapid cycling PTSD and ADHD. The meds I took only made things worse so I stopped. I've been fighting symptoms unmedicated due to subconscious fear and denial.I had a psychotic episode last week that lasted a few days. At one point I recognized my delusions for what they were but the feelings didn't leave. I even had the presence of mind mind to mention inpatient. But I was too scared. So instead of taking it out on my husband verbally I internalized. I have so much self loathing that I felt I deserved to be hurt. To die. I didn't deserve my family. But I couldn't abandon them either. I love them and they should have so much better than me. In the past month or two I stopped taking care of myself. I feel so stressed. I force myself to eat once every other day. I haven't been showering or grooming in a while. Fighting addiction. Not sleeping. Car keeps breaking and I can't keep up with bills. I hate myself but want to change. Would you go to the new appointments or consider inpatient at this point? I have gotten a new job and I desperately want to excel there. What should I tell them? I will get stable. I hope I never experience a psychotic episode again.,Bipolar

I have been struggling to cope lately Bipolar II and anxiety and not a damn thing makes me feel better. I am in this constant state of emotional discomfort that manifests to the physical. I want to be left completely alone so I don't have to worry about the toll taken on myself and the people I love. I'm so focused on pushing people away I feel like I don't love anyone anymore...at least for right now. I try to avoid any sort of affection and I just feel like such an awful horrid person. My boyfriend is so supportive and I feel so guilty and angry with him for trying to help me because I'm tired of the help and I just want to give up. I've felt like a ghost for a while now why not be an actual ghost? My boyfriend just got his concealed carry permit and I just wish he could kill me.

46054,46048,Ways to help until I can get on meds? Hi! I'm a freshman in college who's had a long history of mental health. I had to drop out of school last year after I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. My doctor said it was anxiety and basically send me to CBT and told me to get back to school. I've always had ups and downs where for a couple of days I feel like I'm on top of the world and can run 5 miles easily. I can study without distraction and can get my work done. Other days I'm too exhausted to get out of bed and I easily snap at people. I can barley do the things I love like read my book or play my Xbox. My mom has been insistent that I have Bipolar Disorder she's kept a notebook with all my Up and down behavior and notices a pattern. I can't get a psychologist until May since the University ones refuse to take me until next semester. Is there anything I can do to lessen the symptoms until I get on the meds?

46056,46050,Here we go again EMDR Take 2 I have PTSD as the result of an extensive history of sexual abuse. My therapist guided me through 9 months of EMDR Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing in 2016. It was BRUTAL but my symptoms were nearly nonexistent after we finished it up. I recently have had some symptoms pop back up and after an assessment it appears that Im in need of a tune up as my therapist calls it. So here we go again... Im starting it again today. I hope that itll be a little less sucky since Ive put some hard work into it previously and that itll be shortlived compared to 9 months of nonstop weekly EMDR sessions. Im still EXTREMELY anxious as I get closer and closer to my appointment today because I know that things will get worse before they get better.Has anyone been through EMDR before? Do you have any coping skills that help you especially in between sessions when your brain is processing everything? PS For the record Im not trying to scare anyone who is facing the possibility of going through this process. Doing EMDR has changed my life for the better. Ive had PTSD as long as I can remember and the relief that its brought me has been amazing. Just stick it out until it gets better. ,Bipolar

What I read has given me a somewhat clearer perspective but it could always be better.I have been around bipolar most of my existenceone of my very best friends has been in my life for 25 years and is BP II. I recognize the difference between the two that BP affects different people differently and that all relationships have some common facets regardless of their nature.But I am curious. Is there anything you wish you would have known going into a friendship or romantic relationship? Anything you wish your friend or partner would have known? I'm lookong for perspectives from either side of the coin. I want to understand more thoroughly so I can be a better partner and friend.Thanks for reading. ,Bipolar
46073,46067,Post Manic Decisions How to Love Yourself After Mania Man this month has been really rough will self realizations. I don't know if any of you can relate. After being super manic for a few months and then having some mixed episodes it left me in the worst depression I've ever experienced this month. I've been spending a lot of time in bed and not leaving the house sleeping a lot suicidal but not acting on it basically depressed AF. Anyway my mind recently started having flash backs to stupid decisions and things I've don't while I've been manic. This isn't just the most recent manic episode it's flashbacks from my entire life. I did some not so great things made some not so great choices and went through some traumatic shit. I keep trying to meditate or do breathing exercises to let the thoughts pass. Anyway it's not going well it's pretty much been mental torture. Physically it makes me cry out of nowhere have panic attacks crazy sleep patterns throw up and some other fun stuff.Recently I've been feeling like a prisoner of my own mind just sitting here with my thoughts rotting my mind. It feels like my mind is trying to torture me and my body is trying everything it can do to survive. I'm stuck in mental illness purgatory. I've been trying to hang in there. Any healthy suggestions to try to make peace with the fucked things I've done while manic? I'm always too hard on myself but some days my brain feels like it's taking over my body and I'm not driving this human vehicle anymore. The thoughts and visualizations of the past have just been haunting me. ,Bipolar
46090,46084,Bipolar people with bipolar family members do you guys seem to sync up phases with said family members?

46091,46085,Small bursts of elevated mood while in a depressed phase? Hi there I am new here. Two days ago I was told by my therapist that I could be diagnosed with a bipolar disorder and recommended meds.I never realised that I might have something like this. If anyone would be so kind and answer my very clueless questions that would be amazing. My cycles of hypomania and depression are long ? so I tend to have a few months of depression and then one or maybe two months of hypomania. When I am in my depressed state I sometimes feel for a very short time that I will switch phases into hypomania again because I feel energised happy and productive. It only lasts for a few hours maximum and then goes back to the depression though. More often than not it happens in the middle of the night. Is this possible that there are smaller cycles in big cycles I hope this is understandable as I am not an English native speaker sorry. or could this be a sign that I actually am not bipolar? And how long are cycles in general allowed to be when it stems from bipolar disorder?If anyone takes the time and reads this thank you so much!!!,Bipolar
46101,46095,I feel manic but not in a good way.. I dont feel like doing anything creative. I dont feel like listening to music.I dont feel like exercising though I went for a run to try I dont feel like being around people.I dont feel like drinking.

46112,46106,Finding help Hi So I dont know how to start this I dont know If Im bipolar but thats what Im looking to find out. Since late middle school Ive felt depressive moods cut myself for 3years started partying doing drugs and drinking at a really young age and got pretty promiscuous. I never thought I was depressed because sometimes Id feel really happy and I was capable of that. I thought I was schizophrenic because sometimes I feel delusional or lately Ive started kind of seeing things or just being extremely terrified of seeing things. I even started to hear my dog choke the other day and when I yelled about it to my sister she said she heard nothing. I just learned that people who are bipolar have delusions and hallucinations so that part makes sense. I dont do drugs or cut myself anymore and after those things I tried really hard to clean up my act and managed to do very good in school and still am but I have absolutely no motivation and I get distracted SO EASILY like not even adderall will help me again I thought I had adhd but found out this is also a symptom of being bipolar. My mom will sometimes call me squirrel because Ill talk so fast and leap from topic to topic but other times I cant even talk to anyone because I get so irritated. I also have weird sleep patterns I cant go to bed even when Im tired and I feel the need to sleep for an incredibly long time most of the time. I also just hate myself I hate how I look so much despite constantly being praised for what I look like and whT I achieve. I dont know if Im just being paranoid or If I have general anxiety disorder or if Im bipolar... Im scared to reach out snd get help I dont know how. I get so hysterical and I cry so easily and I am so incredibly anxious. My family doctor is an asshole and my family would completely destroy me if they found out I was getting therapy when they were alerted by my teacher who found out I was cutting myself my mom was sad for about a minute and to this day 56yrs since they found out my dad will stay make fun of me for being depressed about nothing and cutting myself. None of them understand mental illness or why anyone with privilege would be mentally ill because they grew up in communist poland and had to escape and they were fine so I just feel stuck but I hate feeling like this I dont know what to do. Tldr i feel like i could be bipolar but im unsure I dont know what to do or how to get help. Family would kill me if they knew. ,Bipolar

46116,46110,This sounds like a mania induced purchase but I swear it's not... I ordered a baby turtle! The backstory is that I had a turtle I found lost and wandering away from the water when I was about 8 and took him home and made a pet of him. He loved attention and ate from your hand popped his head up every time he saw me. I loved him and was so attached. He died this fall I'd had him for 24 years. I was devastated. I couldn't imagine not having him around. I found a website you can order turtles from and finally made the jump to order a baby turtle that looks just like him. I can't wait for him to come I can see this really cheering me up.,Bipolar
46122,46116,Increased sex drive while manic I've been manic constantly for the past week and my sex drive has been out of control. To the point where my fiance has had to tell me to stop touching her. Not because it's uncomfortable just that she has had enough intimacy and isn't interested in physical contact of the sexual nature.In the past when I've been manic I avoid physical contact all together. I just don't like touching people or being touched. I don't know what it is about this time around but I'm always interested in sexual contact with my significant other.Anyone else had this experience with randomly having an increased sex drive during a manic phase?,Bipolar

46197,46191,Slowly getting worse idk what to do Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this I just need advice on what to do my mental health is rapidly declining even with medication most likely due to the severe toxic environmentrelationship I'm in with my partner. I'm 26 and I dont know how to leave we are on a lease together or where to go. My parents live in town and say I can come live with them again but they are toxic in their own way as much as I love them. I dont have any close friends who I could get a place with and I'm pretty much broke even though I'm on disability for mental health reasons. I wouldn't be able to afford my own place unless I went the sect 8 route which I dont think I can due to the waiting list in my area being over a 2 year wait. I've spoken to my therapist about all this and she never really has any solid advice other than you have to do what's best for you and I'm at the end of my fucking rope I just need some direction on what to do anything would be helpful.

46201,46195,Vivid Nightmares Ive had bad dreams since I can remember. I have journals from when I was 8 describing my nightmares. Consistently 5 nights out of the week. They flare and will be worse sometimes. Lately the past few weeks theyve become unbearable. Screaming in my sleep waking up crying or hyperventilating. More concerning I often have 35 min upon waking where I do not realize Im awake and I feel that it is very real and absolutely what is happening. I had a bout of post partum depression early in the year but have adjusted my meds and my day to day has been overall much better. Obviously the holidays are stressful for most but I feel that I handled it normally. I am terrified to fall asleep at night. I usually take sleeping medicine and have found they are absolutely worse when I do not take it. I figured out its not as bad when I take my lamictal in the morning but never the less they come every night. Obviously this is part of my life that I cant seem to shake but I cant understand why its been SO much worse lately. My question do you have constant nightmares? Does this just come with the illness? Is it my anxiety dragging into the night? Is there ANYTHING I can do?Meds Lamictal 13 yrs Xanax 10 yrs as needed havent taken in a month Ambien 10 yrs Vyvanse 5 months,Bipolar

Even visually i see more shadows than are really there. And the demigorgon is always just around the corner not a real one but a metaphorical one that represents deep anxiety.This year i promised myself i wouldnt let it happen again. I telling people i needed help but they didnt really seem to get it. I started asked for small accommodations in august but i didnt get any of what i needed till late December. Its too late now im stuck in the upsidedown for another season because people thinks i was just complaining about the winter blues.The lithium really takes the edge off.

46222,46216,I feel euphoria. I was diagnosed BP1 almost 10 years ago but if you go through my comment history you can see some of my backstory with this disorder. Since November I have spent almost every moment outside of class and work in my room. I stopped reaching out to friends and would just lay in my bed trying to drown my life out with movies. Id go to bed at 7pm every night and just wake up early just so I had more time awake to lay in bed and do nothing. I was doing great at work and finished my semester strong but it took the life out of me basically. New Years Eve I finally decided to go out with friends after not drinking since October. I wasnt drinking on purpose because of my depressed mood. I didnt over do it but I was definitely drunk and didnt get home til 4am. The next morning I woke up around 11 and it was like a switch was flipped. Instead of wanting to be sedentary in my room all day I suddenly couldnt sit still and had motivation and energy. That night I couldnt get to sleep until after 3am and had racing thoughts all night. I didnt feel terrible though thankfully just restless. This isnt my first rodeo so I picked up the signs that Im going into an up swing and notified my doctor and preemptively took an extra dose of my antipsychotic Im allowed to add doses as needed and took a small dose of Ativan .25mg. Today i havent taken any extra doses but man do I feel incredible. Not out of control though by any means. I wont let it get that far. But I went months living like an empty shell and now I feel a fire in my soul. Im going on an overnight trip with a female friend from school tonight. Wish me luck guys. ,Bipolar

My husband is worried I'll lose my job if I check in. I'm scared to go home. He keeps telling me to calm down but the problem is I'm terrified of myself.

46290,46284,Probably the most ridiculous way of fighting my negative thoughts First off I've been a Queen fan since my early childhood. I probably knew all the lyrics to Bohemian Rhapsody by four or five. I was as much of a fan as any poor kid whose family couldn't afford a CD player and was limited to the radio and her parents cassette tapes could be. The movie was right up my alley.Anyways a pattern of my depressive episodes combined with my comorbids is the worse most negative loathsome thought patterns often about my physical appearance. To combat this I have given my attempts at more positive self talk the most flamboyant happy Freddie Mercury voice and wordings I can imagine. And it's working. Yeah it's really really weird and kinda stupid but until i can stand on my own two feet one of my childhood idols can ight the demons for me.,Bipolar

46413,46406,Should I contact BP ex in this situation? Cross posted from rbipolar sos. My BP2 Dumped me last summer in the middle of a mixed episode. Her stated view was that it was because I had made too big a deal out of something to me when she was in a bad space. She left me on the day I had a pretty significant head injury. Because of various medical stuff she had going on at the time we didnt really speak much. We had been planning to marry and move together. That didnt happen. I was completely blindsided by all this. Three months later I left town for medical treatment. Even though she said she wasnt going to do this she completely ghosted me when I left.My treatment hasnt really worked. Eight months later now I am getting closer to being unable to do my work. It looks like I have CTE. I dont have a whole lot of support in life in terms of family and other people and Im losing my livelihood. My personality has changed. I am not planning to continue my life like this and I consider it a matter of maintaining some personal dignity in the face of whats going to be an unpleasant future. Yes Ive done everything I can and Im continuing to try but I live in the United States and theres not a real viable set of alternatives for me. I will probably end my life later this spring or in early summer when I can wrap up what I need to do to not leave a mess other people have to deal with. This question is not about that decision. I have my dignity and the prognosis isnt good.And I dont know because I cant tell whether she has ever come out of this phase or if shes still in it.Should I send her a letter and and tell her goodbye? Its the only unresolved relationship in my life. It would be especially helpful to hear from people with BP. Would you want to hear from me or would it be better just to find out from other people? She was having a hard time with all relationships at the time and I dont believe at least then she hated me. I think she still loved me. I dont want to do it in such a way that would feel weird and manipulative I want to give her something tangible that if she feels anything at all at this point or some point in the future will let her feel some kind of closure or at least that she wasnt abandoned. She doesnt know how bad its been or that its degenerating. How do I say it?,Bipolar
46421,46414,I feel like killing myself but I might as well see Into the SpiderVerse first. I'm in a really dark place right now. I think I've been in a funky little depressive episode for a while now. I've been cancelling my therapy appointments because I have too much anxiety to talk about my problems but then as a drawback I don't get to talk about my problems. Now I actively want to die instead of just passively. Last night I stood outside in the cold until my fingers hurt so much I cried that wasn't the goal the goal was fresh air but that's what ended up happening.I'm thinking the most likely outcome is that getting out of the house for longer than 30 minutes for the first time in two weeks will improve my mood enough that I'll find some other reason to live past that. But right now all I've got figured out is I'm going to see the movie before I do any dangerous impulsive thing. Sound good?,Bipolar

She were there for me the whole time but things worked out in a way that I developed a crush on her. I really thought wtf mania. Again?. But I had my lithium tests talked to my psychiatrist and sadly I wasn't manic at all. I was really suffering because she has her problems too and when I try to talk with her about it she doesn't respond well. I tried do keep my distance try to get over it but she likes me a lot and we became even closer. Relationships are a huge problem for me and my friend is in a different phase of life. She broke with her first boyfriend recently they were together from age 13 till 18 church boyfriend holding hands only she was unhappy and now she is dating a lot of guys no strings attached a lot like what I do but it hurts for me to see it. I started avoiding being at the same places she goes to and the others close to me are telling me she is not really all that. So I decided to put our friendship on a hold too since I'm unhappy with this let's speed date everyone we can and maybe we'll get together at the end. I can't keep having sex and making out with strangers to compensate her actions you know? It became toxic. Yesterday we've had a huge fight about it because I told her I didn't like to be exposed this way. Edit 1 She thought I called her a whore idk but things went ugly and she told me that I was the one she liked. It doesn't matter because it was turning my first time being ok with my disorder in making me feel like a mess.

I don't care to do anything not even take a shower and I'm on 5mg of abilify and I have no idea if my dose is too low or if I'm experiencing a side effect. I plan on calling my psych tomorrow to see what they think. The thing that confuses me is that I've got a bazillion ideas but when I try to put them into action there is just no action. I can post all day long on social media because I'm talking about myself but trying to write anything zilch. It's like I have an idea but I can't get the idea out and it's gone beyond writers block. It's like I can't think or something and I have no depression good but I also don't feel happiness bad. So I'm just super flat emotionally. I never used to be this way until about a year ago where I experienced a major depressive episode and ended up in the psych ward best decision ever made btw learned a lot. I just am so irritated that I'm so bored despite having a bunch of ideas flowing through my head. ampx200BI have ADDADHD but I can't take meds for it so I have racing thoughts and ideas constantly.

During that week they got me medicated with Lamictal and Latuda stabilized and finally I was discharged with a follow up appointment with a pdoc already scheduled for me. The problem is that my insurance ran out at the end of January. I currently have no job not for a lack of trying I just bomb the interviews horribly and no way to pay for a doctor's visit and my local resources can't do anything for me for a couple of months due to lack of openings through my county's community services board I don't know what the term is for other places but this is set up to handle mental health stuff for uninsured or under insured people. My awesome therapist decided to keep seeing me even though the insurance is now cancelled and my primary doctor is going to work with me to get me taken care of as well. My therapist the pdoc in the hospital and my primary care doc have all advised me against going back to work right now and are urging me to seek temporary disability benefits as they all feel that I need a year or two to get back to a functioning level and I hated to admit it but I agree with them because I am completely unable to handle leaving my house most of the time now days. They all told me to go to social services and apply for Medicaid so that I can keep going to the doctor which I am working on as well as trying to figure out how to get disability. I have no insurance or money to pay for a pdoc appointment first appointment as a new patient is base priced at 300 and medications the Lamictal I can get without insurance for around 15 while the Latuda is about 1500. The makers of Latuda offer a discount program themselves but it's only up to 600 which still leaves me about 900 to pay out of pocket so that does me no good.In the meantime I have no idea how to get my medications refilled and I know that I can't just stop taking them.The pdoc in the hospital said the Latuda would only be for a month and then he advised that I stop the Latuda and go fully on the Lamictal 2 times a day. Of course that would ultimately be left up to the pdoc I was scheduled to see.Should I contact my primary doc and see if she will write the Rx as the pdoc said it should be be after the month of Latuda was up? Is there anything that anyone knows of that will help me get low cost or no cost help?ampx200BThanks in advance. I hate to ask here but I don't know where else to turn at this point and I don't want to annoy my doc or therapist until I have an idea of the direction that I should be going in first.ampx200Bampx200B,Bipolar

46581,46573,nightmare related to my bipolar disorder I have been extremely manic the past week or so and a few nights ago I experienced a nightmare that really irked me. I get weird dreams and nightmares quite a lot but this one was extremely unsettling. It started off with me walking down a street in the city I live in and I could see something up ahead so I started walking towards it. When I got close enough I saw a person with a bag over their head being held in handcuffs by two men and was wearing a nightgown of some sort with BIPOLAR written across it. They were knocking door to door telling people to stay away from people with bipolar disorder and that theyre freaks. I started running down the street and I passed two children in a window sewing dolls not sure what that was about but pretty creepy and after that I woke up. Overall it was a horrifying dream and I would like to know if anyone else with bipolar disorder has had a nightmare similar to that. ,Bipolar

I had some of my very best days ever in those 4 months emotionally speaking but I had some ugly blisters and a mouth full of ulcers that Iwe eventually decided were due to a reaction to Lamactil.SO i've been doing a fast taper 50 lower a week I'll be done with the taper next weekend...This morning had an emergency appointment witht the pdoc because the depression lows were getting worse than they had been since before starting Lamactil...So she wants me on a fast taper up to 300mg of Seroquel. The side effects terrify me I'm already obese being lethargic and gaining wait along with all the other pretty common side effects...I mean I know I'll probably feel better maybe but at a cost I'm not entirely sure I can bare.My other option is to use copious amounts of marijuana which she is like 5050 on.

The psychiatrist told me I was not a candidate because I was not depressed but had bipolar type 2. I got a second opinion and he also confirmed bipolar type 2. ampx200BEver since I got my diagnosis I've kinda gone off the deep end. On one side I got an answer to my problem and a potential solution. But on the other side I am now unable to see any part of me with any normalcy.

46741,46731,Reclaiming Life After Destructive Mania So I have sought help for mental illness since I was 15 but was always misdiagnosed for 19 years. This resulted in a MASSIVE manic episode 2015 where I lost my job ended up on the street and in the psych ward. Declared bankruptcy. Luckily my folks helped me get off the street I sought help got the right diagnosis. Clawed my way back into working and have held down full time work for over three and a half years. Problem is Im still depressed and traumatized by the whole thing. I have a pretty serious drinking problem and get after it as soon as I get home from the office. I would use weed but it causes mania for me. I went to an outpatient rehab but the counselor was an idiot so did me no good. I also cannot seem to get back to a healthy diet or exercise regimen. Im just Blue and am like well got a decade shaved off life expectancy with the diagnosis so whats the use ?????. Just dont know how to overcome these three issues.

46743,46733,Lady Lithium returns! And the drama while she was out The postal service apparently got confused when I meant that when I changed my address I wanted them to update it in their system. Consequently I went a total 16 days without Lithium for my Bipolar 2. During this time my bf21 and I 23 discovered some circumstantial coincidences suggesting that our newly moved in gf21 might be cheating on us with her ex bf. It was a whole thing shit got weird and she distances herself physically and emotionally when we confronted her she said our fears were unfounded hes here on a business trip hes in a room with two other dudes. Tried to not give in to doubt but depression whispers so so close to your ear. Anyway I continually saw texts and snapchats coming up on her phone under dudes name. There were other things too mostly that shes been inconsiderate lying sneaky and had tried to turn bf and I against each other following an argument of theirs. So after a business week of thought we broke up with her. She had no reaction it was almost like everything went as planned. The following three days have been filled with her running out of the house to claim some more territory coming back and exclaiming about her conquests. Shes on the lease so if. We let her stay on the condition she gets a job and really keeps up with bills. As you can imagine containing myself while unmedicated has been one fuckload of a task but Ive held my tongue. Got the meds back in me last night started to feel better this morning and a little more throughout the day. Until a friend came over and told me that she had recently messaged him trying to latch on to him. I got so angry that I was shaking I ripped apart our storage room and consolidated 30 boxes into ten. I threw a mattress in there and set up a corner all nice. When she got home from work she said how sweet it was and thanked me for creating space for her rather than leaving her to sleep on the couch in our living room. I wasnt doing it to be nice just dont want to see the bitch. Round two of returning to meds tonight and Im up sleepless readjusting sucks glad for 24 hour internet service ig.

46799,46789,Going to see a new Dr. tmrw and hopefully hop back on the med wagon! This is very long and in no way asking for a DX. The whole reason im booking an appt with a qualified professional tmrw is so I am able to get Dxd. This is more of a vent post Can anyone tell me about their experiences with mania and the journey to a DX I guess. Anyways loooong post under this paragraph. Im on mobile so i apologize for any mistakes.I suspect i have bipolar. My friends suspect i have bipolar. When I first went to a therapist for devoloping issues after I made a very stressful move at 18 and was really struggling she was the first to suspect Bipolar and pushed me to to see a psych. She suspected bipolar due to very impulsive behaviors sexual and dangerous and hallucinations that happened while I smoked. Unfortunately I didnt see a psych for a long time.Who really knows but i would like for this at least to be considered bc i had a hell of a time last summer and im probably gearing up for another hell summer if i dont get something straight. I in no way am qualified to diagnose myself of course and this is mostly so I can get my facts straight to tell the doctor.Last summer starting around march my mood really picked up and i was having delusions paranoia psychosis all that good stuff. Maybe it was the weed maybe it was something else. I at one point believed the owner of someone i was dogsitting for was secretly filming me from a camera in her bed and her tv. I thought every police man was out to get me. I felt watched all the time. For a straight month I only ate stale kid sized bags of smart popcorn from my trunk and this was before i got kicked out of my house. I never slept more than 2 hours. I got kicked out of my house for smoking weed constanly even though i promised I wouldnt do it again. I drove like a manic In talking going 100 down I95N any baltimorians here?? yall hit essex and the highway gets all twisty the adrenaline rush was insane At the time was in the middle of a ED relapse and just didnt give a fuck I mean i was planning to buy a dog a car an apartment with absolutely no money. Shit me and the friend i was living with had elaborate plans to start a dog grooming business. I quit my job suddenly one night for no real reason and once spent an entire 7 hours filling out loans. In september I bought a car with a loan that hand a ridiculous interest rate and smashed it into a exit sign a week later bc my phone died and i was agitated and got bored I have no idea what this was but thank god im alive bc i totally smashed my car to bits. I was wearing my seatbelt and I joke im a walking seatbelt ad.At the time I had been on Lexapro for about two weeks after seeing a psych and expressing the issues that were going on which she said sounded like anxiety and depression. The doctors in the hospital told me it was anxiety and depression. Maybe it is. I would just like some answers. I was in the hospital for six weeks where they tried out Lexapro again and after I had adverse reactions extreme irrabilty impulsiveness they switched me to Prozac and Risperdol and Dxd me with BPD and let me go. My aunt had BPD but i also have a family history of undiagnosed disorders that caused extreme psychosis my grandfather used to hear voices and suffered mood swings but he was black and this was the 60s black people didnt go to the doctor for shit like that they either drank it away or went to church. When i got out i spent 1500 dollars i didnt have on random shit including three tattoos and completly fucked up my credit. I was medicated with a low dose of Prozac 20 mg and Risperdol .1mg at the time. Three weeks later i was so depressed i did nothing but sleep and not eat. I lost ten pounds. They admitted me to the hospital for my ED about a month after I got out of my first hospitalization for the car crash. The psych there said a BPD dx didnt make sense coming from someone who had only known me for abt four weeks and pulled it off my record. She put me on prozac and seroquel but didnt give me a bipolar dx just left it as historical. I was doing okay and moved in with my Aunt in Texas and had about two weeks where i went off the seroquel bc i couldnt get it refilled. I stopped sleeping again and was just generally euphoric. Nothing too crazy I was just very happy and excited and never sleeping and playing sims like a maniac. I stopped taking my seroquel after I got it refilled bc I didnt like the feeling of forced sleep. Stopped taking my prozac too cause i just dont give a fuck lol. Now ive been off my meds for about a month and a half and Ive been okay very impulsive and hyper sexual making questionable decisions quitting a new job I had for about a week becoming a Cam girl hopping on tinder but still sleeping. I wanna go back on my meds but I know that after being off seroquel this long I have to wean up to the dose I was on 300mgs cause theres no way I can just start at that high again. Anyways anyone else just experience wild ass shit before they got a DX?? Even if im not bipolar I really dont want a repeat of last summer lol.TLDR Im trying to go back on my meds and get a DX from a doctor. Had a wild ass summerfall last year and just generally did not have a good time. Anyone else have trouble with multiple DXs before they settled on one?,Bipolar

46830,46820,Depressive Symptoms Seem to Always be Present. Hey everyone! I was officially diagnosed with RC Bipolar Disorder around 3 years ago. I have luckily been at baseline with very few manicdepressive episodes for about 23 years. But lately I have become more cognizant of a background feeling of depression that always seems to be present. It is really more of the physical feelings rather than the emotional feelings e.g. listlessness fatigue body aches flat affect etc.. I dont feel depressed but I have been depressed enough times in my life to know what the symptoms are. Does anyone else experience this?

46835,46825,Recently started treatment and I was told to double my quetiapine dose last night but got hit with some kinda scary side effects. Is that normal? So my psychiatrist wanted me to double my dose from 50mg to 100mg last night and I did. As soon as the meds start to kick in my heart starts beating like crazy and I get this extremely dizzy feeling like I am about to pass out any second. At times it feels like my body just starts falling as I lay in the bed. I have taken a lot of different drugs but this feeling made me panick a bit thinking I might be allergic or something. A couple of hours in and the symptons didn't change so I figured that if it was something that was truly dangerous surely my symptoms must have gotten worse by now and I went to bed. Didn't feel any side effects this morning except for some pretty bad shoulder pain but that started while I was on 50mg. Are these normal side effects and I just have to get used to them? Didn't feel anything like that at all while I was on 50mg. But I have only been in treatment for like 5 days so most of you know better than me. I also took 10mg of zopiclone about 5mg of lunestaeszopiclone last night and some melatonin. I am also on a lot of tramadol and sometimes some instant release oxycontin due to some pain I got after being admitted to the hospital with acute pancreatitis. Which is actually how I found out I have bipolar. so maybe it had something to do with mixing it? I have been on zopiclone for over 6 years though and never experienced anything like that. Thanks for reading it all! I hope some of you can help me out since I am kinda new to this and can't call my psychiatris till monday. ,Bipolar
46838,46828,Are manic episodes somewhat forced? Like I mean when Ive been manic its like Ive lost track in thought. I have an underlying feeling like Ive needed to change for a while. Like Im not happy with who I am. So before I go manic or at least the early stages Im thinking of shifting my mindset to a more positive energetic state. Whether thats mania taking place or just me thinking myself into mania I dont know. But it usually blows up into insanity where I have no self control. I feel like now I have a gf its less likely to happen because she gives me affirmation of who I am. I dont feel the need to change who I am or improve. Maybe this isnt what mania is like for you guys but Im interested to hear what your opinions of how in control we are of it happening in the first place,Bipolar

46926,46916,Advice for Communicating with Psychiatrist? So I've seen this guy on three separate occasions and the first time we met he seemed very serious about only meeting with me if I stayed compliant with my medication. Honestly I have a problem with doing so because I've been a bit selfdestructive and purposely go off of medication to feel something or to induce mania.Well after having a particularly bad depressive episode after a particularly bad manic episode that started to become psychotic seeing shadow people forming complex delusions thinking my assailant is after me again I'm struggling to figure out how I'm going to talk to him about dumping my seroquel down the toilet.Truth be told like I've read many others say seroquel makes me feel dead. It helps regulate sleep but I hardly function in the day and it does a damn good job of making me in a continual depressive state. I told him when he tried to represcribe it to me the first time I met him after being out of the psychiatric hospital ... and he didn't listen to me or take me seriously when I told him it makes me suicidal. cSo now that I broke my promise of not taking my seroquel idk how to communicate to him that I don't trust him. He didn't even refill my lithium after we first met so I was rapid cycling all of February. I feel like an emotional train wreck and the seroquel helped me crash from my manic episode last week but this depressive episode this week was god awful.Should I just find a new psychiatrist if I don't feel like he is helping me and I don't trust him? Being on Medicaid makes my life more difficult. If it helps I have type I with psychotic features and PTSD.Thank you in advance for helping. I've found this subreddit so supportive and not knowing anyone with bipolar disorder I don't feel as completely out of my mind seeing so many similarities to other people with my diagnosis.

I thought I was suffering from depression alone. Recently It got so bad I finally made the call and was eventually diagnosed as bipolar 1. Now that I've been officially diagnosed I've been so out of my body. Trying to look past the stigma and facing the signs that have always been there is so surreal. Makes me think how long I've been suffering from this and how alot of things are explained.I'm in therapy now and I've gotten some answers but now what? I feel like therapy is so wasteful. I go talk for 50 mins and I'm back to my brain spinning until we meet next time. Nothing is better just more confusing. I did not want to be on medication if therapy would help but at this point I dont feel like a chat is enough to help me cope. I'm afraid to lose alot of myself in it all.

46952,46941,Positive experiences with mood stabilizer? Hi everyone. So I had an issue on Friday evening. I had what my husband thought was a seizure but the emergency room physician said was a dystonic reaction likely to my medication seroquel 100mg which Ive been on for about two years at varying doses. Aside from that Ive been having odd neurological symptoms for about the same amount of time that Im having investigated by a neurologist currently. So Im seeing a new psychiatrist and at the request of the treating doctor Friday they have come to the decision to taper me off of seroquel and add a mood stabilizer. Ive never tried a mood stabilizer. This is the plan so far. She also affirmed my bipolar diagnosis made by the last psychiatrist I saw and also suspects I suffer from PMDD. But thats another story. Week 1 50mg of seroquel nightly 450mg of depakote Week 2 25mg of seroquel nightly 900mg of depakote Week 3 Stop seroquel Start 12 tablet of trazodone for sleep as neededjust wanted to hear positive experiences with depakote. Im trying to go into this win a positive attitude instead of being fearful.,Bipolar
46955,46944,How can you explain your depressed but there is no real reason? I have been in an ongoing depression for almost 2 years. Yes I have had a few manic episodes but extremely short lived. I have BP1 and anxiety and several other things. I have no motivation to do anything. I have these ideas and know what to do but I just cant do it. When I start its like being in a hole with stuff constantly falling on me and I become so overwhelmed I just quit. I know people say its laziness and some of could be. But I know its something that isnt right. It is starting to affect my relationship with my husband and I myself. I am at a point where I just dont have any reason to do anything. I have had a chance at several interviews but when the time approaches I cant go thru with it. Its like Im terrified of having some kind of freak out at work and that cant happen again. I have lost all motivation and I take my medication religiously. I have been stable for several years my last hospital stay was in 2007. My medication has stayed the same but we went out of the country for 6 weeks and I have never been the same. Has anyone else just had that feeling that you know something isnt right but also terrified of talking to a psychiatrist because of medication changes. It took years to get my combo right. I have had so many reactions to most meds the thought of that just scares the hell out of me. I dont know why I felt like sharing but at least I know that everyone on here has had the experience of all the mood swings and manic and depression its like you can understand me. I feel like my life has become a roller coaster ride and I am starting to wonder will this ever end??,Bipolar
46966,46955,Is this the beginning of the end? Hello FriendsSo since my hospitalization at the end of December I have been more stable than I've ever been in a really long time which is great. Recently over the past few days I've had some increased irritability and very low energy. It could just be stress from work or it could be the beginning of my next depressive episode. Does anyone else have that sense of panic that sets in when something like this happens? For me it's the fear of losing all the progress I've made when I was stable. It feels like that fear of my mood swinging back down is always on the horizon. Can anyone relate?,Bipolar

Each morning I get up at around 12am even though I went to bed on time. I just hit the snooze button over and over. I'm on 35 grams of zyprexa daily so that might be a contributing factor.ampx200BAbandoning my schoolwork I'm in my last year of college and I have to write a dissertation.

I'm throwing away my future for some quick fixes.ampx200BNot sticking to my word I've gained some weight this could also be because of the zyprexa it's not too bad but it's definitely noticeable. Last week I measured my weight and noticed I'm 8 kilos above my goal weight. So naturally I told myself to stop eating junk food. Well yesterday when I got the chance to order some fried food I instantly went for it. Instead of resisting.yesterday I went out to have some drinks for the birthday of a friend. The day before I already had too much beers so I said I wasn't gonna drink alcohol. I started the night of with a soft drink but the moment my friend said let's have a beer I instantly caved...ampx200BSorry for the long post I would just like some advice.

I am just so sick of this I'm exhausted.,Bipolar
47073,47061,Help me. Anyone else had the struggle of being pushed into a wrong diagnosis? Hey so this is my first post here and i need some advice as this has been stressing me out. Sorry if its a bit long .Basically after about 5 years of therapy at multiple hospitals with multiple people I got diagnosed with bipolar 2. It was such a relief to know what was wrong with me and why these sudden breakdowns and well mental episodes had been happening to me. It fit and was comforting having confirmation that its not me or who I am. I have bad depressive episodes roughly every two years always when Im perfectly content with my life no events no reasonable triggers nothing. Manics have been less visible to my hospital as well I was off doing far more important things E.g my now I look back on it completely incoherent master piece of an application to a prestigious design school. Instead of attending appointments. Although they did see a couple days which confirmed to them bipolar. In between those times Im just normal happy average George. So getting to the point my second admittion to the priory hospital private so not related to my previous treatment happened last year during a depressive episode. In one session my consultant told me he didnt think it was bipolar. I asked why his response was nothing more than you dont look like someone with bipolar What the fuck does that mean?!? So he told me in his opinion its BPD. Disregarding my previous YEARS under the nhs who All agreed on bipolar. Now Im out patient and have been back home nearly a year and doing really well despite Having had loss and a difficult home life. hes referred me to a therapist. Turns out she only treats personality disorders. I had my first session with her and she went through the criteria of what is needed for a diagnosis of bpd. thats what he had changed my diagnosis to on my notes!!! Ive met him maybe 5 times over two years including inpatient stays. Now with bipolar I do have the symptoms she is describing but only when I have episodes. When I made it clear its only in episodes that these are present and my episodes tend to be separated by months or years where none of these symptoms exist she scoffed and said that doesnt matter and ticked them off anyway. Im finding it hard having people try to make out that the way I am when Im ill is a problem with my personality and therefore something I can control. I came to this subreddit as Im hoping you understand how horrible it is for someone to 1. Make out like you have control over this by changing your thinking. 2. And taking away the only thing that makes sense of why I do and say and feel these intense almost out of body episodes. I know full well its not like me to go out for three days and not sleep going to random places not having any sense of danger and losing who I am. Im not putting anyone with bpd down. Its just a very different experience when it feels chemical. I would choose bipolar over bpd any day because I have long periods of time of being normal. Im really scared they are going to change my meds and what treatments theyll give me. Anyone had similar to this??? Sorry its so long x,Bipolar

47082,47070,Does anyone have experience getting meds from a PCP instead of a psychiatrist? I have an HSA through United Healthcare from my employer so my monthly premiums are lower but my deductible is 5000. I turned 26 a few months ago and was taken off of my parents' insurance so it took me a while to find a psychiatrist in my area that took United. When I initially set up the appointment with the new psychiatrist I was told the initial appointment would be 150 but after that it would be 68 until my deductible is met. Today I found out that it's actually going to be 120 per appointment until my deductible is met. I'm waiting for someone in the claims department at UHC to give me a call back to see why it's so expensive but I was wondering if anyone has experience just going the primary care physician route in the meantime? It would be much cheaper for me as I'm in an entry level position and the payments would be easier on my wallet. I am seeing a therapist regularly it's 60 per session with my therapist until my deductible is met so I will absolutely still be getting care,Bipolar

47093,47081,A mothers letter about forgiveness and psychsosis I just wanted to share a letter my mother schizoaffectiveBP I wrote to me bp II.I have been here under many different usernames but the gist of it is that my mother who I love with all of my heart has been psychotic many times while I have grown up and the rest of my family has frequently abandoned her. She seems sometimes evil and terrifying and I cant blame those who are less educated for being fearful.But I feel that this letter she wrote me encompasses how human we still are in psychosis. Just because our reality is different doesnt mean we are any less human or have any less capacity for love or caring. You are never less than simply because the reality around you changes. I will say I am immensely traumatized by my mothers psychosis and wouldnt wish it on anyone or anyones loved ones but I would give up anything to be there for my mother and to have lived this life being able to love and care for her.Her letterI've wanted to write about this for a long time but the memory is so special to me I wanted the writing to do it justice. But it just hit me that it is a good birthday sending.Do you remember those flesh coloredflats you had? They triggered my manic thought walk a mile in Lilychickadees shoes. I bought some just like them at Walmart and would wear them when I wanted to keep you with me in spirit. Because every time I go manic 'They' always say Lilychickadee is the strong one.Last spring I had maybe three months when I was manic but not in the hospital. You dad wouldn't let me drive smart man so I took the bus everywhere. One day I had a caseworker appointment in Edinburg. I took the bus to the depot in downtown M and from there another bus to E. I told the driver to tell me when we got to FG. He did and I got off. I didn't realize I got off on J. Do you know how far J is from the Expressway where My hospital is located on FG? Miles. hahahaha.So I started walking down FG. In my mania it seemed as though the expressway moved further away from me as I walked! I'm very serious about that. Suddenly that purple purse I was carrying like a baby transformed into you I used to carry you everywhere when you were a baby and the way that feels apparently doesn't leave a mother's memory. I was carrying you keeping in mind how I need to walk in your shoes. I was so so so distraught by the thought of you traumatized when taking care of me in my maniapsychosis. I walked and walked and walked and walked. And walked while Expressway moved further away. You never left my mind as I carried you and walked. It turned into a way for me to prove my love for you after all you've suffered for me. I thought I would walk and carry you like this forever if it meant you could experience some ease after struggling so hard. I barely made it before TT closed and my caseworker who I had never seen before took so long it was the night before we left for her to drive me home. She took Expressway and do you know every single light car lights traffic lights expressway signs and billboards businesseseverything that had a light that light looked incandescent like you see psychedelic colors portrayed. I rode with my mouth open! All I could think is that heaven had come to earthas in the Lord's Prayer Thy Kingdom come.I felt ltGodgt giving his approval for how unquestionably and unfalteringly I proved my love for you. Which made me think He set the ordeal up in the first place!LightsI emphasize that it was Lighthave never shone like that for me again.You are so special.My love for you is unparalleled.Happy Birthday.,Bipolar

I just put water in my mouth lean back and let it sit in the back of my throat toss the pills in open my throat to swallow then drink some more water.

Im not working because of PTSD plus bipolar making my brain panic mush. Im doing better than I have with episodes in the past. Im getting out of bed. Im doing care for my little family my husband and pets. Im mostly taking care of the kitchen and all food related things for the household.Im just resting a whole hell of a lot more than I want to. Im wasting away my day with nothing good to show for it. Probably 50 of the time Im awake Im in bed or sitting somewhere comfortable doom scrolling. I need to provide income so were not so tight on money. After consulting the hive mind of my friends and family everyone and myself have concluded that I need to start a business. I have an idea Id like to track down but I cant get going. Its become an extended issue. I just cant get going.I have a tharapist I love and I cant decide if I need to see her more often to work on this. Or if I need to go to occupational tharapy. Ive done occupational tharapy in the past and found if useful but Im not convinced it would be a second time.Ive met my deductible so more tharapy with my regular tharapist is free. Tharapy with occupational Id have to find in network. I live in a rural area so unless I can get virtual from the metro in my state it might be difficult to find something thats covered,Bipolar

I have anxiety and fears that I've never experienced. Fear of death etc. You know what my psych told me? These aren't things common with latuda. He told me that I need to get tested for obstructive sleep apnea. All of my symptoms point towards that instead of mental illness. What the hell!

49490,49565,How do you deal with your past? I dated an undiagnosed bipolar 1 while I was an undiagnosed bipolar 2. We met on a mania in our early 20s. Im sure many of you can imagine the drugs and fun we had on our high. I ended up pregnant. He came down hard and I started having suicidal thoughts from all the drama being bipolar entails. I had an abortion. It was the abortion or drive off a bridge. Even his catholic family had choice words for me that made me feel all the more trapped.I cleaned up and went back to college and started traveling more. He went to rehab 2ce. I wrote him while in rehab the 2nd time. He was kicked out of rehab for acting on his hypersexuality. Him and the lady became a couple and had a daughter. I leave him alone because now hes diagnosed and I took a few college courses to educate myself on mental illness. I knew he wasnt in full control. He would call me from fake numbers in the middle of the night and wed talk never meeting up. His lady caught on and would call and confront me. I sent her receipts that its him after me. Eventually he stopped contacting me knowing Id snitch.Its been 8 years and Im now diagnosed and medicated myself. I recently had my own daughter. Ive been thinking about him and looked him up. He reached out to me 2 years ago right before I was diagnosed and I responded with his arrest record.As Im looking into him I find out he was in a coma from going in to cardiac arrest. Hes learning to walk talk and move his hands again. It looks like he lost a finger. His family hasnt posted any information about how or why. Also my daughter has the same name as his mom totally forgot his moms name and my spouse picked the name.Im in this fog of wanting to reach out but also why? We are living separate lives. Its been almost a decade! I questioned if it was real love or the mania for so long..My spouse and father of my daughter is a good guy. Hes stable and loving. He isnt jealous and we have talked about the ex in the past. We have agreed that we chose each other and not the exs. However he will never understand what not being in full control is like.Its how I ended up on this sub. Looking to see if I was as crazy as I felt. Looking for similar experiences and stories and boy did I find my community. Just looking to get this off my chest and for yalls 2 cents and experiences.,Bipolar

49512,49587,Missing my old dreams. This is a bit of a rant but had to get it out. So I always dreamed of being a professional musician as I got older as like a full time thing. I played instruments since I was in grade 4 I was a very talented musician not saying that in a pretenious way. Music was my life I was part of jazz music programs inside and out of school wind orchestras scored perfectly on all my NYSSMA performances New York State Music Association even skipped a few levels because I was advanced. And part of All County band programsa hand selection of students to be part of a large bad group that would perform in front of 100's of people. I then moved on to get a scholarship to a music college I however decided to join the army instead and became a profession musician for them for 8 years performing for presidential speeches Veterans day and St.Patrick day parades in NYC played half time shows at NFL games etc. I used to love just sitting at a piano and letting the music flow through me sure I wasn't the best in the world but the raw emotion I put into my music was just a feeling I can't even explain now it's been over 4 years since I've touched sn instrument and I just feel so empty about it. My living situation makes it difficult to practice playing and I just miss it so much. I just want to make music again and my depression is holding me back and I hate it.... I'm so sorry for rambling I just had to get it out best of wishes to all of you,Bipolar
49535,49610,I think the worst thing about being bipolar is the mania vent? Ive dealt with depression a lot. I hate it but its my normal. I recently went through 5 months of mania where I acted horrible. I did everything except have delusions of grandeur. I ended up being sexually assaulted which I believe shocked me out of it. I couldve really hurt someone or even gotten myself killed. Now anytime Im in a good mood I start panicking and crying thinking its coming back. That was my first manic episode and I was on a lot of Cymbalta during it. I also wasnt officially diagnosed until after the fact. Im dealing with aftermath of my bad decisions and will be for at least a couple years because of the debt I racked up. Ive been depressed all my life. Mania however scares me more than anything. Im fairly certain thats not the general consensus.,Bipolar
49541,49615,Why does my brain know when to be depressedmanic? Why does my brain know when to be depressedmanic? Typically I cycle over the course of a few days at most but my psych increased my lamictal so I stopped getting depressed as often and don't really have mood issues unless I get stressed or take caffeine or something. I've been burning the candle on both ends recently and I have had frequent and almost constant but relatively mild bursts of energy with only mild dips into normal or depression. But I decided to actually get some sleep for once and now the depressive ends are hitting me really hard and the high ends are just me being normal instead of energetic. Usually I cycle over the course of a day and I am wondering how my brain can remember that so many manic bursts happened last week. Like is there some part of the brain that counts all my episodes and tells the other parts to be depressed? I guess I'm looking for a more brain psychology answer not like an analysis of my behavior or anything.,Bipolar

49649,49730,Friendships I keep getting into fights with my closest friends and it's almost like I can't help it. I always start them and I always say sorry earnestly after. They know I'm bipolar. My two closest friends aren't talking to me right now and I don't wanna be lonely for the rest of my life. I'm just wondering if y'all can give tips on maintaining close friendships. I'm bipolar 1 btw not fully stable yet I'm manic right now and I'm on lamictal and abilify. Was diagnosed almost a year ago.,Bipolar
49660,49741,Possibly losing parenting rights due to bipolar disorder The most recent manic episode I had was after being depressed and diagnosed with major depressive disorder to be prescribed Zoloft. Within 6 weeks I was staying up for 9 days and delusional. I thought my partner was going to kill me so I called 911. The police arrived and I was very agitated and explained my delusions and they took me to the nearest psych ward for an evaluation. Unfortunately that psych ward didnt keep me long enough despite my volunteering to stay longer. They also gave me a medication I ended up allergic to which took treatment even longer.This resulted in asking my inlaws who live in a different state miles away to help me care for my daughter until I found the right medication combination and was stable. I knew it could take a few months and I had no one else available local to me. The only way my inlaws would take my daughter is if I signed over guardianship. I was under the impression it would only be for a year at the most. But honestly I wasnt really in the right mind to consent to that paperwork. I just knew I needed help and I did what I could to ensure my daughter had the best care possible while I got stable. Fast forward to now my partner and I petitioned the courts to end guardianship as I have been stable for 2 years. I have letters from my therapist and pdoc stating I am in treatment and stable and medication compliant. Well my inlaws are trying to prove I am unfit for things I did while I was manic so they can adopt my daughter without my consent or permission through the courts. They're also trying to prove that my partner their child is unfit I am less worried about that. My therapist says they're on a witch hunt and that they're just trying to raddle me and no judge would grant them adoption. I hope she's right. I just wanted to share what I am going through because 1. support would be nice. and 2. if anyone else is going through this you aren't alone.,Bipolar

Last week we were looking at places to get married. Im fucking miserable and dont know what to do.I called my provider but earliest she can see me is the 10th.

I have more energy than before but burned down my studies and social life because of my depression and I still feel like shit.Im not bad enough for inpatient and theres no intensive outpatient where I am and I barely have therapy. I dont know what to do Im glad Im not just crying staring into nothingness and sleeping anymore.

49680,49762,Minimal success for 8 months Hi! I'm headed into work so going to just get this out fast in hopes someone can give me advice.I have been at home for almost 4 years with mostly depression some hypo mania and one scary manic episode brought on by an antidepressant. I also have extreme anxiety and adhd.I started Lithium in August and was able to help my husband at work within a month. I came out of my shell began to make eye contact conversation and was hired on as an administrative assistant. My career was teaching but I know I can not be that person anymore. I have struggled the whole time but was managing okay enough to continue. I am not okay again. Work is stressful in an unreasonable way and I can feel myself crashing. I am terrified of becoming the hermit I was for 4 years. I was hospitalized last March wanting to die from so much empty. I need to keep a purpose.Anxiety is almost unbearable and the empty I can't do it anymore feeling is taking over. Music and TV feels fake and every task is a huge effort. These are some of my signs. I am back to needing ativan to function most days and adderal the others. How can I prevent a full crash? Help!Current medsLithium 600mg at nightAtivan a couple times a week and increasing Adderal when I am paralyzed several days a week.I just added 500 mg magnesium glycinate and Vit D3.Any words of wisdom are appreciated.,Bipolar

I know what I need to do to combat them. But damn its a fight every day. I dont remember having this fight 10 years ago. That being said we are fighters. We can do this.

49696,49778,My life is so sad that even my psych doctor ghosted me My ex who was the best sex I've ever had and I've had a lot of sex dumped my stuff in my living room on Sunday and politely told me he never wanted to speak to me again. Well maybe someday which means neverTo try to cope I posted for hookups on Reddit but every guy I sent my photo to rejected me this was never an issue before but I guess now that I'm 30 I'm ugly. I'm not fat I think I have a good body must be face issues. I look really tired in all my photos.So life sucks. I've stopped taking my meds properly because I hate them.I've stopped eating meals because I don't want to go back to being bulimic.I blocked all my friends and family because they told me to talk to a professional about wanting to start drinking again I'm sober and since there's no professionals to talk to 247 I guess I'm shit out of luck and better off not bothering them.My mom did a wellness check on me when I told her I'd blocked her which I said she could do.... but lol.I bought my first vape yesterday because I don't want to break my sobriety and I do not care if I start hearing voices. And I tried to go to AA last night only to listen to a bunch of people whine about how hard step 4 is while I'm literally writing it in my head just trying to find a sponsor to do it with.Now today my psych doctor has ghosted me. The professional I'm supposed to talk to about drinking. Can't decide if she's doing a form 2 or something came up. Cherry on top of this week lol.,Bipolar
49698,49781,Bye Bye Citalopram Ive been on a roller coaster the last 9 months with medication. I had started to think I had been misdiagnosed based on how terrible I have felt despite lithium and an SSRI plus Seroquel at bed. I even scheduled a new psych for a second opinion in April. Then through some bad juggling and admin by my GP my citalopram prescription was cancelled instead of renewed. The pharmacist gave me a loner box of meds but it was a lower dose. Fast forward a month later and Im still on the lower dose. Low and behold hallelujah I feel fantastically average. This aint no hypo and Im definitely not depressed. Wow. Im considering going to an even lower dose but my intake appointment is so close I feel like I should probably leave it for now. Woo!!,Bipolar

I love my mom so fucking much we were close and we bonded through having bipolar disorder. She understood me without trying she was the only other person I know who goes to treatment for bipolar....

49746,49832,I am sober 72 days and trying to resist ending my sobriety. I am no longer taking my meds right and going to buy weed. Where do I turn to for help? Story inside I recently went through a very distressing breakup where he cut me out of his life completely. I don't have any family or friends to call they all tell me to talk to a professional. So I blocked them. No sense causing strife.My psych doctor doesn't answer emails my family doctor doesn't have an email or phone number my therapist doesn't give out her number or respond to emails. I don't know where to turn in crisis. The wait at my ER is 12 hours or more.I don't have a sponsor yet or anyone from AA to call. Meetings make me sad because I am not ruining my life with alcohol I have nothing to ruin even if I tried. Bipolar takes those things away from you.I really want to go buy it. Everyone tells me not to drink but doesn't want to support me when times get hard. I understand they have their own problems and it's not personal but I NEED HELP. I only fucking stopped drinking beduse a psych doctor said it would help my moods and how my drugs process through my body but I've never felt worse. It's been 72 days and no end in sight for the pain. I am no longer taking my meds right and going to buy weed. I am done. I will take the psychosis risk. I'll take maniamWhere do I go? Is there a helpline I can call when I need immediate support to not buy alcohol? I don't feel suicidal so I'm not sure if that is acceptable.Let me repeat in caps.

49750,49837,I think I was misdiagnosed Okay so 2 years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and at the time I was like this doesn't sound right but I guess I'll go with it. I was put on lamotrigene after a 20 minute appointment with my psychiatrist where with some vague descriptions of what my highs and lows were he decided it was a solid diagnosis. But the thing is he never asked for specifics about what they were like just generally if I experienced them.The highs of my 'mania' would last about 13 months at a time and usually consisted of me being very active and upbeat but I never exactly had any risky behaviors associated with it. I've never had periods of hypersexuality or completely upended my life on a whim or anything extreme like that. I can get irritable and my impulse control has never been great but I've never felt like my thoughts were racing or anything like that. Probably the most 'extreme' thing I've ever done was to move to a different state after a 5 year relationship that I felt trapped in ended. I just needed a fresh start from it and I got that before moving back home with a better perspective albeit in the middle of a depressive episode.In fact the only really concerning thing I ever had going on were intense periods of depression also lasting between 1 and 3 months at a time. I would have a hard time getting myself motivated to do basic tasks and my interest in things I enjoyed waned during those times to pretty much nothing. Being put on meds I was just coming out of a long funk and after starting lamotrigene it never really felt like that funk ended. I still have problems motivating myself to do basic things even 2 years in and I constantly feel like I'm lagging and forcing myself to do everything and I hate it. During my up periods I used to actually workout and be active and would write and take my son to the park and be an active and eager participant in family activities. But since being medicated I don't have any of that. I'm gaining weight and have zero motivation to do anything about it despite being miserable because of it being an active parent feels like a chore and I can't write to save my life. I feel like I'm a totally different person and I don't want to be this way anymore. I think I might have been misdiagnosed but idk how to broach this with my psychiatrist I feel like he barely listens to me. If anything my symptoms are much closer to that of ADHD or MDD just applying my lived experiences to them but when I tried to bring up ADHD he kind of handwaved it away saying that adult ADHD was difficult to diagnose and left it there. I'm not sure how to bring this up with him and was hoping some people here might be able to give me some tips on how to do that? Should I get a 2nd opinion from another psychiatrist? I just want to stop feeling this way.,Bipolar
49758,49845,some questions I have adhd and my psychiatrist suspects I have cooccurring bipolar ll. i dont know how i feel about that cuz it seems like theres a fair bit of overlap between adhd and bipolar symptoms even though theyre completely different conditions. here are some questions i have how does cooccurring adhd affect bipolar symptoms?how does hypomaniamania look different than a mood shift related to adhd? if youve ever just been on stimulant medication what was your experience?,Bipolar
49759,49846,Bipolar x Anxiety x ADHD I was diagnosed as bipolar but honestly I don't know if I am. The signs I have seem to be more ADHD than bipolar including rejection dysphoria trouble concentrating procrastination etc. What I have that maybe are bipolar characteristics are sometimes I get irritated easily attachment issues maladptive daydreaming GAD and depression. But other than that I don't know if I'm bipolar. I am for now taking 450mg of lithium for 5 days. In 2 days I will increase to 900mg. I'm scared because I don't know if this is really my disorder. What happens to people who aren't bipolar but take lithium? I'm not feeling any positive differences it's just making me feel bad physically for now.,Bipolar

My old one from the other state made it clear last time that he would not refill it again. I'm fucking stupid and this is all my own fault.

He is so happy and a beautiful soul but Im a terrible mother. I am currently depressed and going through a mixed episode and know for a fact Im affecting him with my low mood. He asked me today are you mad at me mommy? It broke my heart because I know he knows something is wrong. Unfortunately my husband is deployed and he isnt here to help me. My parents and siblings are no help. I just have to push through this but deep down inside I regret adopting him because he wouldve been better off with someone else.I feel like Im living this big lie and I just want to disappear inside myself and die.

Does it make mania and the depression episodes completely disappear? Or just more manageable?

49833,49925,that moment when it was bipolar the whole time so all my life I'm 30 sometimes when I haven't eaten and my blood sugar is low I get really weak and shakytremors. eating a snack generally fixes it pretty quicklybut sometimes it happens even when I've just eaten when I'm full or otherwise have no appetite and its hard to make it go away. eating doesn't help even when I eat the same things that I normally do for it. I've always been confused by this.but it turns out that the psychomotor agitation from hypomania can cause the exact fucking same symptoms. hashtag thanksIhateit.

I had read a book and articles on bipolar disorder and I realized it kinda fit my behavior. Then I went to a psychiatrist and they confirmed and diagnosed me. Now I'm prescribed an antipsychotic but I'm a little nervous to take it because what if I don't have bipolar and I'm behaving like I am to prove that I am bipolar when in actuality I'm not bipolar? if that made any sense to anyone. My biggest fear is that I don't have it and I'm taking this god aweful scary antipsychotic that has so many possible side effects and it'll end up hurting me in the end because I don't actually have bipolar.

But I found a can of reduced sodium soup in my cabinet and there is no way my roommate or I would ever buy that. We both have POTS and are on high sodium diets. I got this deep seated feeling that either someone broke in and put it there or more likely there is some sort of supernatural shit going on and Im being haunted. I know rationally that this isnt true. But I still feel anxiety in my gut that Im being haunted and bad shit is going to happen. This is a pattern I tend to get really emotional about some conspiracy or something supernatural. One time I salt lined my friends apartment because someone left a creepy doll in the vestibule of her building and then it got moved to the laundry room.

I am Bipolar 1 and have been stable since 2016Some lows but no manic outbreaks.My psychiatrist put me on 1600mg Lithium and 6mg risperdone coming out of hospital in 2016. Now I am at 1200mg Lithium and 1mg Risperdone.My new NP who oversees my meds and mood seems like a knowledgeable guy and ran it by me to see if we could try new meds. He wants to make sure the side effects of my current meds arent affecting me too badly.I am concerned because these are the only meds I have been on since being hospitalized.

I had never brought up the manic feelings I got where I'd just be really confident and happy for no reason kind of like not giving a shit about what anyone thought and then having a million ideas thinking how I'm gonna improve my life also wasting a ton of money on games because in those moments my mind just goes do it who cares. I never told him about these feelings because I thought it was normal. I've always thought how I felt emotions was completely normal because I thought everyone had no control over them and because it was normal for me I had never known any difference. I know for a fact that I'm bipolar and I'm diagnosed but it still feels like pepple think I'm lying for no reason or like no one believes me. I'm not lying about how I feel and my symptoms but it feels like everyone thinks I am because what they say is how did no one find out about it until now. I never talked about it because I thought it was normal. I only started talking about it when I said I feel like only sometimes I'm lucid and other times I have no control over how I feel. Like it feels like I only swim to the surface once in a while and then I'm dragged back under into depression and mania rapidly cycling between the two. It feels like after my diagnosis I started cycling more and more rapidly? Like I've kind of lost any semblance of control I had left I guess. Like I feel manic when I'm depressed or vice versa. It's scary because it feels like I'm having more frequent mood swings like 34 times daily. I don't know if they're actually more frequent or I'm just realizing that I'm having mood swings because I never recognized them before. I don't even know why I'm posting this I guess it's a cry for help? Idk I know that I'm manic right now and I'll probably think what the fuck later but it feels like what I should do right now. I'm so scared I feel so out of control. I had to take a leave of absence from college. I don't know what to do anymore I feel like I'm just at the whims of my emotions and I hate it. I'm so scared. Does anyone have any advice or support? It feels like my life is slowly spiraling out of control and I just don't know what to do anymore.,Bipolar
49921,50017,graduate from college I finally got my bachelor degree today. Im currently hypomanic right now and my mind is super annoying like i want to have sex with every girl that i know and some anxiety but mostly im happy at the moment. After going through a lot of shit i finally got it. Yay.,Bipolar
49922,50018,I dont know what to doneeding to vent 43 F was diagnosed with BP II at 34 years old. My parents definitely both have some type of undiagnosed mood disorders but Bipolar runs rampant on my fathers side.Currently taking 375mg Lamictal extra 100 added because I use the Nuvaring 900mg lithium and 300mg of gabapentin. I had a pretty bad alcohol issue prior to January. I realized I went into mixed episodes when I mixed lithium and wine. So I switched to Whiteclaw and had no issues and now I just have not been drinking much. Like an idiot I was feeling relaxed the other night and thought it would be nice to have some wine to further calm down. Just had a glass. Last night I drank the rest and started getting super hopeless.My issues with bipolar lead to my husband telling me he wanted a divorce 2 months ago. I was struggling a lot in the second half of 2022. I was weaned off Lexapro after taking it for 8 years. Historically i do not do well in periods of adjusting meds. I was getting better by early January as I stopped drinking wine. But then the divorce happened not officially but no chance of reconciliation.My kids 13 and 15 knew he wanted a divorce before I did. They thought it was a good idea because of all of the fighting. My 13 year old still spends time with me but my 15 year old doesnt even like being around me. I love spending time with them and its the only thing that makes me remotely happy at the moment but they are just not that into it which makes me less happy.I literally am so miserable. The only thing that I like doing is going to concerts. So I bought four concert tickets for shows over the next two months. I just dont know how I can sustain being so depressed. I am a midlevel practitioner in a profession I cant get out of because of a bias stigma against. I hate my job and its actually physically injuring me. Im in 400K student loan debt 120K being the actual loan the rest as interest. I wasnt aware that I had bipolar when I started professional college. My career requires an entrepreneurial mindset and this motivation fluctuates. Ive tried applying for jobs outside of my profession but I know Im qualified for and I am always rejected or looked over.I have no family or friends closer than 1000 miles that actually care about me. Just online friends. I live in a very expensive city near where my husband is from and cannot leave.I just feel like I exist to bring in a paycheck and give my kids rides or help them as needed.If you have gotten this far thank you for reading. Would love any thoughts or advice.,Bipolar
49924,50020,Silly impulse purchases We've all made questionable impulse purchases when manic or hypomanic. Some of these can be very negative and detrimental. But many of these can just be silly and just Why?So my question to you all is what is the silliest purchases you've made when manic or hypomanic?For example I bought a pretty black sparkly violin on Amazon It was on sale!. I don't play violin. I've never played violin.Or one time I went to Petco to look at fish. I left with a parakeet bird cage and all the fixins... We had three cats all of them mousers. They would have murked that bird. It was returned the same day.So do you have any silly innocent purchases that make you go But why? that you would like to share?,Bipolar

49968,50066,Always out of PTO because of this stupid disorder I get great benefits at my job including paid time off that accrues every pay period so in theory I should be able to bank quite a bit of it. Unfortunately I've already used almost all of my PTO because of a surgery and a major depressive episode plus days when I can't leave the house to go to work. I had to leave work today and I feel like shit about it I know I'm probably going to have to make it up next week and that stresses me the fuck out. Most people I work with never take their PTO never seem to have a sick day. I try really hard to be a good employee but my absenteeism can't be good. My management is super understanding and supportive but I still feel like shit about it. It's not a super important job in the scheme of things so it's not like I'm really hurting my workplace by taking time off but I really want to keep this job for a while. I hate that I'm always anxious that this time will be the time they finally fire me.,Bipolar

Like financially it's no issue I speak the language and I'm a European citizen so I don't need a visa or anything hell I don't even need a work permit to work there and my health insurance works there just fine so why not right?Idk it sounds good to me rn but I already went to Italy a few years back in a manic episode and ended up broke and if it hadn't been for my dad back then I probably would be still living on the streets there so idk if moving is the best idea... maybe just a vacation?,Bipolar

All of them I tried an entry counts as one. So if I feel awesome that's a 5 and for the evening I feel terrible that's a 1 it counts as my day was a 3.But in realty if felt awesome for like 10 hours and terrible for 1 would be useful if it would count as 4.6.I feel like that would a more accurate representation of my feelings at the end of the day,Bipolar

50047,50155,How do I stop spending money??? Ill preface this post with the fact that I have bipolar and Im young. I know both those things contribute to the impulse of money spending. I am still in college and my parents give me money for necessities groceries therapy gas money to visit home. I DID have a regular job but I quit because of how toxic the workplace was. I babysit pretty regularly and I am in the running for a job as a ghost tour guide so its not like I CANT afford frivolous things but I do feel bad about not having basically any money in my savings 20 to my name right now! Its insaneI am no longer someone who buys clothes just because I like them but I did go up a few sizes due to medication increase and diet change so Ive been having to replace a lot of my old clothes. I always shop at goodwill though and lately I havent had to buy that much. I dont buy house decor anymore since I am definitely fulfilled in that aspect. I only buy art supplies when my current ones are totally out of use.I think I impulse buy fast food or even restaurant food super easily when I can just cook it or use my meal plan at school. I only have to pay 1k2k per year at school due to scholarships and financial aid but its still a big chunk my parents now pay half ever since I quit my job. My biggest vice however is legos. I buy so many legos especially when Im feeling anxious. Theyre a super efficient distraction and a really engaging hobby. Even my parents support it because they see how it calms me and makes me happy. But my issue is that whenever I get any sort of significant money I immediately go to buy legos. I dont know how to stop or budget or anything or put any of it into a savings account without just taking it right back out. Its like every other week at this point.I need help. How do you all save money? You all know what I do and dont spend it on so do you have any tips?,Bipolar
50082,50195,Mania is changing with age I am 27 and have a 1.5 year old. I have found that my mania and hypomania is significantly different at this point in my life than when I was in my late teens and early 20s. Back then I gravitated towards dangerous and hypersexual things while manic. Nowadays I don't even have the same thoughts cross my mind. I feel hypomanic for sure right now and I find myself filling my calendar with volunteer opportunities and weekend events to take the kids I'm a step mom too to. And honestly I'm super grateful. I used to do the craziest stuff and it was dangerous and unwise. Now I certainly am aware that I'm putting a lot on my plate right now but it's all good stuff. I'm trying to lose weight quit smoking and find activities to be closer to the community and my kids. I feel like the change is both with aging and also becoming a mother really calmed me down overall.,Bipolar
50087,50202,Medication I haven't taken my medication in months because I lacked health insurance and could not find someone to sign off on prescriptions.

50089,50204,Meds keep losing effect is that normal? I'm awfully sorry if this question has been posted before could find anything on this. Fellow bipolar 2 here.I've been on meds for more than a year now 5 months of which I was on antidepressants only cus my doctor and I both thought it was depression as is pretty common. Since I got diagnosed she put me on mood stabilizersantidepressants. But I keep having to change meds altogether bc after 23 months they just stop working.I wonder is that a normal thing? Or is it a sign that something's up with my diagnosis andor treatment? Will appreciate all of your input.,Bipolar
50095,50210,Finally stabilized but... I am finally stabile after half a year of searching for the right drug and dosage. However what happens is that I feel that I do not function well verbally I am too apathetic asocial and in some situations it happens that I do not understand what people want to say to me or that I cannot express my thoughts not always but sometimes. Before the onset of the disorder I was witty more open to people I expressed myself very well verbally and some people considered me smart because of that trait. Now I feel that I am losing that quality and the question is how to solve these difficulties? What are your experiences with dialectical cognitive therapy?,Bipolar
50097,50213,Bipolar and borderline I was diagnosed with BD 6 years ago and received my BPD diagnosis yesterday. From what I get from the internet the major difference is that BPD alone does not experience mania hence the BD diagnosis. Has anyone else in this sub been diagnosed with both? How would you describe it? How's life?,Bipolar
50106,50222,Just diagnosed? I saw my psychologist this Monday after going what felt like through a tornado of emotions of the weekend I was so happy one minuet and then crying the next and getting upset and then excited. I told her about how usually this lasts for a few weeks and then I cant get out of bed only to walk my dogs or do the bare minimum. She said that I had bipolar and my whole world stopped.like I just thought I was always just an intense person who felt a lotIve never felt like I was superhuman or had the sort of manic episodes Ive seen on TVIm just really surprised.,Bipolar
50114,50231,Mixed episodes are worse than mania or depression. I believe Im in my first true mixed episode and I have to say I think I rather just be depressed or manic. Being both at the same time is driving me insane. One day Im signing myself up to go out and be social and the next Im wondering why I ever thought that was a good idea in the first place. I hate it. Suicidal this hour and then normal a couple hours later. I just had to rant because it feels like I have 10 different people inside my head and Im not sure which one Im waking up with each morning. Anyone relate? Im on Vraylar currently and just started Buspar for anxiety.,Bipolar
50118,50236,My psychotherapist and my psychiatrist are almost sure I'm bipolar After long three weeks of depression and a total sudden mood elevation that's been going on for a week now my psychotherapist and my psychiatrist and actually most of my loved ones who aren't healthcare workers even all think that I have bipolar type 2. My psychotherapist sent me links to educate myself on the topic and now I feel completely UNDERSTOOD? I feel like now much much much of my crises actually make SENSE now?! I thought it was just normal in MDD to have sudden peaks of good mood uninhibition hypersexuality agitation euphoria insomnia energy you name it. I thought it was normal for people with it but now as I'm reading about bipolar everything make sense now????!!!!!! I'm so happy to probably have found one of my diagnoses but it is also a lot to unpack and I'll be needing to so some work with myself to stop gaslighting my own thoughts and understand that it's all okay. I've posted about what's going on with my mental health in social media and actually found out that a LOT of my friends and colleagues are bipolar as well and they understand me so much. At first I was sad because I thought there was no one I could talk to that would understand what I was going through but speaking what's on your mind can actually help you even reconnect as I did with old friendships. I feel a lot more in peace now and I don't even got a diagnosis yet but I understand now that what happens with me is common and I'm not alone. Today is my 3rd day with the change of my meds from a MDD treatment to a bipolar one. Still quite hypomanic but I'm positive that everything's gonna be alright in the end. ,Bipolar
50119,50237,sometimes i feel like im just fine does anyone ever feel like they just dont even have bipolar anymore. i know i do and its never gonna go away and the way ive been feeling is literally me BEING BIPOLAR but sometimes i feel the same way for so long that i just feel like its gone. ive been in what feels like a constant depressive episode since august even though i know i have had bouts of mania or psychotic episodes but i just feel like they didnt last as long or werent as severe as they usually are. i got my meds upped around the time the mania calmed down so i know its a good thing but i cant help but feel like its bad. its not that i dont want to be better its just that im so used to feeling insane constantly and i feel like now that everything has calmed down a little it feels like its just over. ive been so depressed since november that its so hard for me to get out of bed and take care of myself at all most days and i hate it. i also hate how fast i switch up and how i go from laughing and feeling normal to being extremely angry and crying. thats another thing i feel like ive developed these huge anger issues and ive been lashing out and being so mean to everyone for no reason. i have such a hard time verbally apologizing so it makes me feel even more like shit. i feel like im never going to be able to live a normal life or like genuinely feel better and have it last lol. i feel like i cant handle or cope with anything the way i used to and ive just become so mad at the world. i havent self harmed since last summer and i know its a huge achievement but sometimes i feel like it was keeping me grounded in a way. idk if anyone else ever feels like that. i just hate being stupid,Bipolar
50157,50276,Random things we do as being Bipolaror Bipolar w Anxiety? I was diagnosed Bipolar 1 along with a few other mental illnesses in 2011. I never have other bipolar people or friends to ask these questions hang with me here I hope this comes out correctly.Anyone else with bipolar constantly pick at their nails like I pick mine so bad they are killer sore and sometimes bleed. I cant stand feeling the dry peeling skin rubbing against my other fingersIve been diagnosed so long and have taken tons of medication and I still feel like I just will never be normal? Like at this point what does a normal person experience in their day to day feelings?Ill go through a month of reading books on my kindle or regular books and finish them like in 34 days 1 I finished in a month. Same with watching a series on like HBO max or Hulu.I go through moods of deeply into the show and just binge it so fast amp then a week later its like I cant even focus or have enough attention span to watch anything at all? My mind is constantly thinking about the next I need to do like it doesnt stop whatsoever only time I feel relaxed is when my night meds hitsleeping is the best bc it takes me from this hell of reality I struggle with daily. There are many other issues I experience but these really have been bothering me lately and I catch myself wondering do other with bipolar have these issues or am I alone and just a wee bit crazy? ,Bipolar
50158,50277,I think the change in seasons is starting maniahypomania Woke up this morning feeling great and had energy. But I know thats not a great sign because that hasnt happened in half a year or so. At this point Im just bracing for impact and waiting to see if its hypomania or not. I say hypomaniamania because I experience both and my therapist still cant decide if its bipolar I or II. Possibly an issue of deciding if the mania was actually full blown mania. Anyways I just woke up feeling good and I dont trust like that.,Bipolar
50165,50285,I read a book cover to cover today I used to annihilate chapter books in a few hours. This year I completely lost my ability to focus. I am failing classes for the first time in my life. For contrast I have a full ride university scholarship. I haven't been able to focus on textbooks for a few months but haven't done real leisure reading in easily a year. Not because I don't want to just because I can't put in the time.Today I read an entire book 432 pages in under 24 hours. I am so proud of myself. I haven't done this since middle school and I remember every part of it I didn't just skim it.I don't want to get into the circumstances surrounding it or what it means as part of a larger whole. I just want to celebrate that regardless of how or why I did it.,Bipolar

50173,50294,Anyone with comorbid bipolar and pssd? Wondering how you experience the combo. For me the anhedonia makes every hypomanic episode feel incredibly empty and frustrating. I just feel increased energy and irritability and never good. I never feel pleasure. Only thing i notice that improves is some motivation to socialize and date so i become very talkative and impatient but i never feel rewarded for the motivations i get. Its like an itch you cant scratch. The increased mental libido with sexual dysfunction is also extremely frustrating. Anyone relate?,Bipolar
50178,50299,Have to get out of depressive episode ASAP Been on a depressive episode for the last 23 weeks I usually cycle with the seasons.. was living in Canada for 10 years which made my depression on winter unbearable now I live Mexico and its way better. My episode are not as severe and I guess for a moment I took it for granted that my episodes were mild and I was stable for a good while. I work independently as an artist so if Im not in the studio theres no one I have ti answer to which in general I love. I love what I do and Im so grateful to be able to do it. Im at stage in my life where Im expanding my business and moving to a bigger studio space and its all great! But the the episode started creeping in and I cant afford to give into it Im getting all these anxieties and fears I know I can do this and have been fighting everyday but this week has been really hard. Im in the studio at the moment but havent been able to lift a finger. Trying all the skills and coping mechanisms I know help me plus my meds so really hope this ends soon. Letting all this out I think will help havent talked about it much with people as Ive found I focus more on the feeling but needed to vent.,Bipolar

50185,50308,My manic episode that revealed I had bipolar I have had a bitch of a time with mood swings for the past 5 years and Ive always white knuckled it out of partially shame and partially not realizing that wasnt normal. I quit smoking weed and didnt sleep for 2 weeks and went on a spiritual powwow and got arrested for breaking and entering. It was at this point I realized I was not on a mission from God and then it got really scary because I went into psychosis while I was in the jail. And I got pepper sprayed so I was laying on the floor choking and having no idea what was going on. But luckily I didnt die and now I know that I need latuda,Bipolar
50204,50329,I was diagnosed with Bipolar II yesterday. I guess it's my life now. Hey everyone I 18M have had a mental illness all my life. That being ADHD. I was on Medication for it for about eight years until last year when I began to feel... different.My ADHD used to consist of hyperfixation hyperactivity and inability to concentrate so normal ADHD stuff but last year before I graduated high school in May I noticed something was changing. I assumed it was my ADHD just evolving with new symptoms as I got older but towards Graduation time and shortly thereafter I realized I was wrong. It began to get worse with huge depressive episodes I would cry or feeling like crying some days and be fine the next. And I would feel worthless like I didn't mean or contribute anything and then have confidence that soared through the roof. I started snapping on people and then being okay the next second. The anger and mood swings problems got worse within the past few months. I work retail and I've been showing attitude and anger and even hatred one moment and then I'm super happy and energetic the next second. Even outside of work I snap at my parents my best friend and have constant negative emotions. I have started talking supersuper fast without realizing and feel like my thoughts are going a million miles an hour. MY Psych mentioned this to me yesterday. One of the biggest things that coincides with the anger and mood swings is my impulse control and motivation. One thing I lack is impulse control I know something is wrong but I still choose to do it anyway. This has affected me with porn gaming too much and most importantly spending. I have credit cards and I paid them off a month ago and once again I have a huge balance on both because I know I shouldnt be spending money but in the moment it feels like I should. Also the lack of motivation issue is huge. I want to go to the gym I want to go out and do things but I just can't no matter how hard I force myself to try.After an argument with my mom about how she's worried about me and how she knows something is wrong I came clean and told her that I've been keeping how I've been feeling from her my dad sisters and my psychiatrist and therapist. I was afraid to be on new medicine and to be diagnosed with something new. My psych told me that sometimes ADHD can evolve or even be mistaken for Bipolar since the two share similar symptoms. I was put on Latuda yesterday and I feel no difference yet since it takes 3 weeks or more to do so but I'm hopeful. And hopefully I can learn to live with this since it's a part of me now.,Bipolar
50205,50330,The paranoia is killing me I feel so isolated and afraid. Things are turning crumbling. I feel like I can't turn to anyone. My psychologist and doctor understand but damn the nights are so long and in the day I have to be around so many people I can't tell what's going on for me. Some professionals even don't understand me unless they know me very well. I'm a serial masker and even when I'm wanting to throw a chair through a window I'll just casually say I'm raging right now and they don't take notice lol. So some professionals don't take notice and others say things like I'm very alarmed at my behaviour. I just can't be that person I used to be anymore exploding rage and emotion. Luckily a have professionals that see the signs clearly but talking to others can make me feel invisible.I feel like everyone in society the world around me online is watching everything I'm saying and doing even people in cars or shop assistants. Which I know sounds ridiculous but I feel like I can't move a muscle or say a thing it's constant. It's even hard to post here.It was fun with the spiritual and sensual bliss but now it's just hell. I made the mistake of having a nap before midnight and I won't sleep tonight. I got an exam today I'll see my nurse thankfully then my therapist but right now I just see this long stretch of night ahead of me. The house is so quiet I'm worried I'll see ghosts if I leave my room lol. I just feel so very alone.College helped so much they're very supportive there my classmates are amazing but it's getting confusing for me there too. My mouth is starting to get me in trouble. I feel like my world is getting smaller section by section. My psychologist said it was ok for me to go to a Buddhist centre for a few days as long as I don't drive there as long as I stick to grounding meditation rather than the transendental stuff lol. So maybe that will help me a lot.I don't even know what this post is about. It's just all crumbling down now. I might try to switch channels in my brain rather than hyperfocusing on my phone. Have something to eat and drink. Maybe try sleep again.I'm focusing so inwardly thoughts feelings etc. I need to get out of my head and into my body. I try to do the mindfulness 5 things but I'm too paranoid about ghosts right now. I wanna listen to my headphones but can't for the same reason. I think I'm literally too afraid to leave my bed or do anything but type and too paranoid to ring a hotline. I'm dreading 3 am but hopefully I will be asleep by then.I dunno maybe this post is an ask for someone out there to make me feel like I'm not one alien on an Earth full of humans lol. Either way I just gotta get it off my chest.,Bipolar

50219,50345,exhausted and venting so i know this wasnt a good idea but after about 8 months of taking my medication regularly lexapro lamictal and abilify i stopped taking them cold turkey. i stopped seeing my psychiatrist because it felt like a chore but i do see my therapist regularly. for a while after stopping my medication i started drinking every single night to get rid of the uneasiness i felt and just to help me sleep. drinking really became a nasty habit for me. one night after work i took it too far ive had problems with a. toxic relationship for a while and while at work he ended up blocking me out of spite and i didnt care much because i knew i would just go home and a have a drink. but that night i came home and got so drunk i started getting super paranoid that someone was watching me and i was crying and i guess talking on the phone so loudly my mother came to check on me. im 19 and still live with my parents but i was upset because she started questioning if i was drunk and said to hang up the phone but i told her i was finally happy and i dont remember much from that night but apparently the next day my mom told me tht i got violent with her and threatened to beat the fuck out of her if she didnt leave me alone. anyways because of that night i havent had any access to alcohol and im proud of myself for sticking to that because i would even drink at my boyfriends house and he could get me drinks if i wanted but ive been good with it and the only substance i put in my body is nicotine now. but now that ive been good with that stuff ive become angry and i pick fights with whoevers around me i get violent and suicidal thoughts and im at a point where i feel worthless. i dont think my environment is helping me. i dropped out of college and i know my parents are disappointed in me. because of my mental health its been hard for me to get a job and now i have a part time in the mall and its a really good environment and very distracting. however my dad is on my case about how its not a real job and im pretty much useless in the house and i dont contribute to anything. i want to respect him and do more but its hard to be in a house where everyone is depressed and projects their issues. my mother is also bipolar but is always giving me advice she cant take. i know its not easy having a kid whos bipolar but it seems like they dont even try to understand me. everyday i wake up and feel so stuck. i feel like i dont have a place here. even my hardest isnt enough. i dont want to be here anymore. im tired and angry. i have no interest in anything anymore other than sex and work because it at least distracts me. also my cat too shes the reason why i wake up every morning. other than that i have no interest in doing anything with my life. i dont care about anything and i never have really. im tired but here i am at 2 in the morning unable to sleep because im burdened by my thoughts.,Bipolar
50222,50348,No family history? I was just wondering if there are others who have bipolar without any family history? I'm literally the only mentally ill person in my family. It makes me question my diagnosis when the disorder is supposed to be heavily genetic . There's obviously something wrong with me and the bipolar diagnosis fits but still.,Bipolar
50227,50358,I'm so tired of being bipolar for the medication factor alone. I try to refill and stay on my medication but there's always an issue between cvs and my drs.office regarding some of my medications. The Dr office will say I have a refill in and then I'll go to CVS and they will say it's awaiting prescriber response and it can only be refilled with the drs approval. it's Depakote then I call back the Dr and they say no it's in there but they will call and NOTHING ever gets done. This has resulted in me multiple times being out of my medication when I need it overnight and now I'm up at 4 am. Listen I have to work tomorrow! I have a life. I can't just be up at 4 am feeling all weird and not being able to sleep. Should I change Drs or what??? Pissed off,Bipolar

After finally coming to terms with the fact that mania has ruined everything good Ive worked so hard for in my life Im recommitted to bettering myself. Only issue is I keep comparing my current situation to the past when tunings were good. I really want to graduate college. I do. I went for three years. However now I cry after every class and have panic attacks at the thought of having to do the work andor study to get through it. Not to mention that my program of study is going to take 2.5 years to complete and I have no motivation. I dont know what to do anymore.

50294,50434,Vent I just wasted 23s of my savings during my 2nd manic episode can anyone relate? Just so disappointed that I 25M spent 23s of my savings on bullshit. Mainly clothes books and random items from local stores that I never use. I worked a lot of different jobs to earn that money since the beginning of college 7 years ago and in a little less than 2 months most of it is gone. Cant even afford to join my family on a vacation to visit my mothers homeland because its too expensive for me And being consistent with a job while my meds are kicking my ass energy wise is extremely difficult. Just feeling down about my situation I know its not forever but damn. Dont wanna be another guy thats just negative on this thread so I hope whoever went through something similar like this will continue to have faith that things will get better and know youre not alone in your experience.

I was put on Ritalin than sedated me until it reversed and mad me worse.I got a diagnoses Of Asperger's syndrome at age 4o And thought the episodes were part of that . I Have been getting worse but I felt like superman when I was up and took it a a good state to be in Hardly the case people would be frightened of my actions which I could not understand why they wanted me to move faster at work cooking 40 years I would become increasing more agitated as the months would go on. and would just fly off the handle and have a melt down and bye bye job.I never felt out of control until recently when my father died in February and I have been on full throttle for a month now so I changed my Psych doc and said that I was manic and took me off the anti depresses that my old doc prescribed. and gave me abilify and buspirone Just wed mar 23 2023 it has been a month since I slept more than 2 hrs. I still up but I am coming down slowly.I never notice the down side I just knew that I felt better not moving as much to the neglect of housework and no motivation to give a dam about work again I had an attitude wile when I was down almost hatting the people I worked with and being resentful of having to work.ampx200Bsorry if this is disjointed I'm still amped up to 11.,Bipolar
50310,50452,i dont get angry. can i still be bipolar? hello! im writing here because im not too sure where else to look.i have adhd sensory processing disorder and an on the gifted spectrum. recently ive been going to therapy for adhd and a few weeks ago my psych brought up that i might have bipolar. ive done a lot of research and have talked a lot about it when herand i definitely have bipolar.im going to see a psychiatrist and try to get meds for it but i wanted to see if anyone else is like this before i get it checked out.i do not experience intense anger. like at all.even before i started questioning if i had bipolar i knew that i didnt have the ability to get angry. sure i get irritated but thats only at my family members. in public i dont display or even feel anger. maybe its because as a girl any negative or masculine emotion is seen as undesirable but plenty of girls get angry.i know not all people with bipolar experience aggressive behaviour but i feel like i should at least be a little angry? im irritable at the most and i feel like its the only trait of bipolar i DONT experience.if anyone else feels a lack of anger please let me know ,Bipolar
50328,50470,Missing my old dreams. This is a bit of a rant but had to get it out. So I always dreamed of being a professional musician as I got older as like a full time thing. I played instruments since I was in grade 4 I was a very talented musician not saying that in a pretenious way. Music was my life I was part of jazz music programs inside and out of school wind orchestras scored perfectly on all my NYSSMA performances New York State Music Association even skipped a few levels because I was advanced. And part of All County band programsa hand selection of students to be part of a large bad group that would perform in front of 100's of people. I then moved on to get a scholarship to a music college I however decided to join the army instead and became a profession musician for them for 8 years performing for presidential speeches Veterans day and St.Patrick day parades in NYC played half time shows at NFL games etc. I used to love just sitting at a piano and letting the music flow through me sure I wasn't the best in the world but the raw emotion I put into my music was just a feeling I can't even explain now it's been over 4 years since I've touched sn instrument and I just feel so empty about it. My living situation makes it difficult to practice playing and I just miss it so much. I just want to make music again and my depression is holding me back and I hate it.... I'm so sorry for rambling I just had to get it out best of wishes to all of you,Bipolar

Stability hasnt been attainable for me Ive only been on meds for a year and havent found the right cocktail yet. Today Im able to give myself a small pat on the back.

50361,50503,Money troubles Hey guys. Im struggling financially atm big time. Last year I had to take over 4 months off and was in hospital for 3 months due to a very severe episode. Ive returned to work since then but part time and I cant seem to catch up on the costs of living with my income. The craziest thing is that Im a doctor registrar speciality training and I still dont make enough to live. My partner is supporting me as much as possible but hes struggling too. I feel so ashamed and defeated. I cant work more currently as I only just increased my hours and the stress and fatigue is full on right now. I have no parental support or other supports. After graduating med school I finally had financial freedom and was doing well. My relapse last year has cost me more than my health and its a real struggle to go back living week to week and paycheck to paycheck Ive been poor my entire life apart from when I first graduated. Is anyone else in the same boat and if so how do you come to terms with it? The situation makes me feel like Im a failure and I feel really embarrassed. Hope everyone is doing ok and thanks to this sub.,Bipolar
50374,50514,Job hunting I've been to a couple of interviews and I think the interviewers just see into my soul. I want to have a job but I can't find one. I'm too eccentric and probably I don't even care if I work or not. I feel like they see it whenever we make eye contact. They see that I would be a bad employee.I don't care about anything at all at this point.,Bipolar
50380,50520,Dark obsessive thoughts Im assuming this is fairly normal with BP but Im so sick of dark obsessive ruminating thought patterns even during relative stability. It seems like every week its something else deathdying of loved ones someone being hurt losing my partner and awful thoughts of not being good enough to be loved. I feel like BP is such a hindrance to me enjoying life fully its like a new obsession every week and Im so sick of it.,Bipolar
50414,50558,How bad does it have to be to be considered psychosis? I know I've had at least one episode of what was probably psychosis because I was diagnosed with stress induced psychosis when it was happening. I don't know if that one was bipolar related or not and I wasn't treated with anything at the time because I was still quite young and the psychiatrist didn't want to intervene with medication.However I've had other symptoms since during what were probably undiagnosed manic or mixed episodes where I've started to believe things that were retrospectively pretty weird. Occasionally these beliefs also pop up when I'm very very depressed. Sometimes I believe these things 100 unquestioningly and other times I know they don't make sense but worry about them excessively anyway. Sometimes it fluctuates between the two.A common one for me is worrying that other people can hear my thoughts especially if I look at them directly. I also get concerns about people working against me or talking about me behind my back to try to ruin my life.Another time I became convinced my childhood home was haunted and that a demon had followed me from there into my daily life. I kept seeing a figure in my room at night and I worried about speaking about him out loud in case he came for me. I still worry about this sometimes and tbf I'm pretty sure that house really was haunted. My childhood friends and I talk about the weird slightly paranormal stuff that happened there so I'm not alone with that but my sudden obsession with it was abnormal.I told a different psychiatrist about those two a while back and he said it was probably due to a combination of autism and trauma and that it would likely go away with more EMDR. Since they kind of just left as my mood changed he was satisfied that his therapy had worked.I had another one where I decided I was actually naturally nocturnal and that other people were interfering with that to purposefully make me sick and stop my plans. I completely flipped my sleep schedule for several weeks although admittedly I wasn't sleeping very much anyway and then fought with all my family and friends about it.At one point I also became very worried that other dog walkers were all talking about me on Facebook and were plotting to take my dog away. Another time I was certain I was dying of some horrible illness and all the medical professionals I saw weren't treating me on purpose because they wanted me to die. I really was sick though but the level of paranoia was weird.I was still somewhat functional while all of these were happening and I wasn't hearing voices or anything for the most part. So does it really count as anything serious? Because it didn't seem that bad to me and my family just kind of ignored it since they'd been told that the episodes were stress related and it was best not to engage. I've never told a psychiatrist about all of the thoughts because I didn't view them as relevant until recently I just thought they were a part of life and it was something I did when I got stressed.TLDR at what point does it cross the line into actual psychosis vs being paranoid and having weird thoughts?I'm going to be starting medication for the first time soon if all goes well. My current psychiatrist is talking about putting me on antipsychotics but idk if these episodes are really bad enough to warrant taking an antipsychotic. I've been reading about the drugs and they sound like heavy duty stuff and I can't tell if for me it's really necessary. I think I'd rather try another type of mood stabilising medication first. I don't know how I feel about all of this.,Bipolar
50425,50569,Should I tell my professor Im sick and miss lab? So this is related to bipolar medication Im on 500mg ER quetiapine I take it every night however I had to pull an all nighter for class so I misses the dose last night. However I get symptoms if I dont take the quetiapine at the same time each night so I had to take it in the morning because I started getting symptoms. Basically I dont think I can even get to class right now because Im so out of it normally I sleep after taking it so I forgot how crazy the side effects can be especially because I havent have food in awhile. So do I go to lab in this zombie state or tell my professor Im sick and miss lab while probably inconveniencing everyone who have helped me lots this semester and been very accommodating.im worried too bc it would mess up my lab schedule and my report is due in a week . But i dont think i can go out an d function right now,Bipolar
50435,50583,Are you a mom? How is that going? Id really love to hear from other women who have bipolar and went ahead with having kids. How is that going for you? Do you enjoy being a mom? Is it manageable?Im a woman in my early 30s and got married last year. It feels like everyone around me is having babies and Im really trying to figure out if I want one. I feel like I could be happysad either way. I just started listening to an audio book about trying to decide about kids and I had to turn it off because it was making me cry. My husband is sort of happy to go with whatever decision I make. I know nobody is making me make this decision but I dont want to hit 40 and just say oops guess I never did that. I really just want to make up my mind either way.,Bipolar
50436,50584,Anxiety and fear suddenly gone Long story short after a very difficult few months and then the death of a friend I am not doing well. My therapist is asking that I seek a higher level of care which I am pursuing hoping for an IOP group spot to open up soon. I do know the ER is there if things get too serious before then but Im trying to avoid that if possible.I think I can finally admit that a lot of my thoughts lately are suicidal. Not sure why I couldnt say that for so long but the fog has lifted enough that its become clear. I havent felt this sick in nearly 10 years since before my bipolar II diagnosis. I have no intention of acting on those thoughts but they are there nearly constantly. But the weird thing is my anxiety suddenly disappeared recently. I dont feel normal or free from anxiety almost like the anxiety left and was replaced by a strange calm apathy. I no longer fear death and I havent noticed myself feeling nervous about anything. It feels almost like when the anxiety left it almost gave the suicidal thoughts permission to be there. Im not scared anymore. Its been a weird feeling and I guess Im curious if anyone else has felt something like this? It feels confusing and I think Im trying to make sense of it.,Bipolar
50451,50601,Saved a ton of water thanks to not showering due to depression I just got my annual bill and I used a fifth less water than previous years. Since November I've been showering very little.

Doesn't make up for all the money I spent during hypomania that came after but it's still nice haha,Bipolar
50471,50621,Newly diagnosed I got diagnosed with Bipolar 2 three days ago and have already been diagnosed with anxiety and autism. I don't know where to start. I am relieved because my mother thought I was having hormonal changes or I was exaggerating but my father actually tried to help. Whenever I think of those moments being frustrated over my mother saying that I was using it as an excuse after I got diagnosed with anxiety it saddens me. I feel better because now she is more careful. What do I do know ? I have some coping methods like music physics math etc.,Bipolar
6976,6996,I am going to make this short because i hate thinking about it but long story short I am getting better after months of medication therapy etc. My anxiety is at an alltime low and my antidepressants do not allow my mind to wander too much into suicidal thoughts. But i hate it i hate that I am getting better i feel embarrassed whenever i catch myself doing something not depressing like taking a walk laughing or doing stuff by my own will. And i feel SO SO selfish i was given immense support from everyone my mum has spent so so much time and money on therapists psychiatrists pills etc she is suffered more than anyone else even more than me since i seem to enjoy being depressed. she is the happiest she is been in months since she can tell I am in a better mood and she is the only reason i have not tried harder to get worse but i do not know how long i can keep it going.Something in me just wants me to maybe stop taking my meds without letting her know get a new self destructive habit and go back to the old me that did not leave his bed in days and could not keep a conversation for more than 2 minutes i really miss it.I am going back to school in a couple of months i dropped out i started driving lessons yesterday I am eating better sleeping better I am starting to live and behave like a regular person but i cannot handle it it makes me feel bad gross EMBARRASSED very embarrassed and its just a cycle ofI am ok this makes me depressed I am ok again this makes me depressed etc.I do not know what to do I am not even sure why i am even writing this since I will probably end up ignoring whatever help or advice i get but i guess i needed to vent thanks for reading and as always sorry for my english how can i be happy about getting better??,Depression
6995,7015,I have not seen my 7 year old daughter in a couple of months because she moved across the country with her mom and it has literally been killing me. My mind was telling me our relationship was damaged forever because of this. She is the only bright spot in my entire life. I have just been alternating between drinking and crying mostly.Today we connected in an online game and had a great time we are hopefully going to be playing regularly from now on and I will get to talk to her and bond with her through this. it is a pretty basic online game for kids but the first thing she did when she met my avatar was to shrink her own avatar into a little baby and jump on my shoulders like she did when she was a toddler in real life. I literally she would tears.I have also agreed with her mom to fly over there and spend a week or so with them soon.My life has been just a black hole for many weeks now and it is so incredibly refreshing to poke your head above the water and see at least a glimmer of hope and sunshine. She does not deserve to lose her dad and I now have new motivation to push on and try to get better.If a terminal case like me can do it so can you hopefully. My daughter just pulled me out of a black pit of despair,Depression

I know from your perspective maybe you see someone who is hurting maybe you see someone who needs help.ampx200BBut if you could look beyond my eyes behind my face. The constant struggle to just be alright and it feels like you are completely alone because you actually are. Alone in this desolate wasteland with crumpled buildings decimated roadways and highways. ampx200BTwisted metal signs relics of the past. With old directions guiding to better places than here. The ghosts of yesterday yelling out from the corridors of collapsed buildings as the wind whistle through the burned out city. The sun glaring down as dark clouds approach gusts of wind kicking up large plumes of dust in the distance heading for the city as lightning begins to strike and bombs begin to drop.ampx200BWithin a moment you are surrounded by flashes of memories all over all around you and in the winds you can hear the faint voices some screaming some crying some are my own voice filled with regret and sorrow and loss.ampx200BThe flashes are so intense that the images of memories begin to bleed together as you see my life unfold in bits and pieces and for a moment just a brief second you see me for who I really am but I whisp away into the surrounding debris just as quick as you can blink. As though it were just a ghost just a projection of all the things I wished I could ever be. Strewn to the wind and shattered into a million pieces as you look onward trying to make sure you were not just imagining things. ampx200BThe storm still flickering lightning and gunfire sounds in the fractured buildings echo around you as all sunlight fades and just as quickly as it came the storm has passed.ampx200Byou are left still wondering if everything you saw was real or not. That image of me the forgotten dreams the screams. How much was real? How much was just your mind trying to put the pieces together? ampx200BAll these questions and doubts like the particles of dust now drifting further away. Like a candy wrapper caught in the wind the idea of ever knowing dies alongside the winds as they begin to settle and the sun blares bright again.ampx200BYou put your hand above your eyes to shade them from the sun as you look to the sky in some hope if seeing more storm clouds. They say every cloud has a silver lining but none of these clouds seem to be anything but black darkness harsh. ampx200BUntil you realize that you do not have to be here and your sight zooms out slowly revealing my eyes and the pain they hide as you travel back behind your own eyes and see this figure in front of you torn by war and so much pain. Not quite human but the figure tries.ampx200BJust as quickly as that image popped up during the storm then dissipated the notion of who this creature is in front of you begins to blur. A hollowed out she will of all the grand things that could have been. ampx200BIt is then I think you would begin to understand that there is nothing left here in front of you worth salvaging and so it would just be easier simpler to walk away. My bad place,Depression
7068,7088,This has been my life for years now. Just stay alive until the next day then the day after that and the day after that. I never get anywhere. Therapy does not work meds do not work.

I am just trying to survive the day,Depression
7071,7091,This morning I had an appointment with my mental health doctor along with my social worker. For about 15 minutes we went through the usual conversation about asking how things were with medication sleep etc.I then decided to be upfront about planning to kill myself after my birthday is done with 3rd of August. They were very shocked by this and asked me why. I just told them that I cannot be bothered anymore and I burst into tears. I cannot remember the last time I cried that much it was a bit of a relief to let it out.But yeah needless to say they are really worried about me and they want to try to push psychological therapy to come sooner. They also suggested about putting me on a ward to held keep me safe.I just want to curl up in a ball in a corner and be forgotten about. I think saying I do not want to live is the right way of putting it. Rather that I do not want to exist as I feel non existent anyway so that might as well be made a reality. I broke down for the first time on years this morning.,Depression
7078,7098,People are so fickle each persons reality is only upheld by judgements made on bits of information they get and everything they think they understand can be turned upside down with just one contradictory judgement brought about by another piece of information.

But I still hold onto my kids I do not want them to ever see the emptiness I do right now. Realities,Depression

7101,7121,I have had more downs in my life than ups to be honest but the main core of this situation was and still is because of my parents' we were taught to respect them and love them because they were the ones who raised us and put a shelter over ours heads. For me these last two years were absolute hell and it was not because of the pandemic but there are several reasons like1. I am pretty smart and got into med university by the age of 17 and because of the amount of stress and trauma I had to deal with I failed2. After failing my parents gave me a second chance to reenter the university and I took it but I was so unhappy that I chose not to do it and went against my parents simply because I was severely depressed and hospitalized due to psychological pains like constant chest pains and I could not breathe3. My parents were not supportive of me. They were supportive when they where showing off to their peers or friends and my dad told me You are nothing but a disappointment and you embarrass us wherever we go I was highly discouraged4. I still get yelled at and pretty much am verbally insulted and was told I cannot do shit in life because I am a complete failure. I really hated when my dad used to tell me You are going to be a doctor so you should know this. The only thing I know is that I really really hate you and this hate adds up even more daily.5. I have this new opportunity where I technically can go to another country and go to university there and my parents will not be able to come. I feel so restrained and so closed in like in a box and I suffocate so I feel like I should say fuck you to my parents and leave but I do not know how well I can deal with myself there too6. Technically they killed all my dreams what I could have became and they took my dreams and crushed it and are the MOST negative people I have ever seen in my life and I do not even want to look at them. I know it is unethical to hate your parents but do not blame the ones they do because some parents clearly suck and I even told them You should have never became parents or I wish I was never born I did not ask to you to be my parentsMy parents makes me want to kill myself and have suicidal thoughts and I cannot take it anymore. They do not know how to communicate at all and they have zero empathy and funnily enough my parents hate each other and themselves as well weird how they have to reflect that on me too. I was an innocent kid with big dreams. I was not born to be insulted like this they are the fakest people I have ever met too. Acting like they care about me in front of others all the fake hugs and such and ask me why I do not ever let them to hug me it is because I hate you and I do not want to see you. I do not know what to do anymore...should I leave to another country and do not see them again? It seems pretty huge but I cannot deal with this kind of toxicity anymore.. It feels like it keeps getting worse,Depression

Is this who I have become?I choose to believe that somehow things will get better. I think that is my downfall. Instead of taking the steps to move forward I sit and wait for things to get better. Of course they never do. Is it my fault though? Or is it just something I cannot control? there is so many things that I do not know. In general and about myself. It terrifies me.

7240,7260,I got really triggered today I do not know if that is the right word I guess I just mean extremely emotionally disturbed by an article I read about how bad violence gets in prisons. How can people do such horrible things and why do none of the staff do anything to stop it? Why is prison rape so commonly joked about? it is not funny at all it is a nightmare. I have never been to prison but I just cannot stop thinking about how soulshattering that experience would be. I cannot stop thinking about how many people are going through that right now as I type this and about how they will continue to go through it for years or even decades. Endless suffering. I cannot stop imagining it over and over again.it is really hard for me to stop thinking about all of the agony that people and animals are put through and everytime I get triggered like this it is like every horrible thing I have seen comes racing back to the front of my mind. I once saw a video of someone grabbing a piglet by his hind legs and slamming his little head against a concrete floor. Another of probably hundreds of baby chicks being stuffed into a garbage bag and suffocated. How on earth could someone do that to tiny defenseless innocent babies? My brain becomes overwhelmed with the images of these scenes and imagining myself in their place and wanting to save them and wanting someone to save me. I do not know how to get it out of my head other than to off myself. There is so much unimaginable suffering TW violence sexual assault animal abuse,Depression

7301,7321,All I have to do is browse the reddit comments. You look like mom's neck beard basement dweller I would date your second chin. And I think that some of these roasts could apply to me. I am a woman. I have been told I am attractive. I think I am. I only weigh 110 lbs and I am 5'6. But I still have excess weight I gained after losing a pregnancy and being put on birth control. So the double chin comment really gets to me. Everytime I see a negative comment I think about how my closest friends could say or think the same thing about me. Especially since one of my closer guy friends is a guy I crushed on recently told and got rejected by in the nicest way possible. I have trust issues. I sometimes think I am not as great as I think I am in the moment. That my friends are internally roasting me in their heads while I look like an egotistical arrogant ahole. Thank you for coming to my ted talk. Today's been rough. I have been struggling with suicidal ideation ever since I flirted with my guy friend again and made things akward. It seemed like he was flirting at first but I think I misperceived the intent in his speech and screwed up again. there is more to this story but I do not want to get into it. I cannot tell if I am overthinking paranoid and waiting for betrayal or if my intuition is on to some things. So I deacti everything. I am staying away. I personalize insults aimed at other people then want to die.,Depression

7524,7544,Hi hoping this will make me feel better. This summer has been hard. I am medicated for anxietydepression have a partner I love and that is so supportive a dog that means everything to me and a safe place to live but it still feels impossible to be happy most days. I work as an RDH and that has taken a toll especially since COVID its exhausting. I like the perspective my job gives me I have a great boss and coworkers but having to always be on for patients is SO draining when I feel like shit myself. Its important to me to be an empathetic providerprovide positive experiences so that is probably the hardest part. I get a lot of nervous anxious patients in pain and I feel like a sponge all that gets soaked up. I wish I lived somewhere else so I felt like I am not here to pay off debt until I die. Parents are retiring soon and I just think welp that will never be me. cannot afford good enough medical insurance to get quality care nothing ishas ever been worth the copay. I used to want to have kids to give them the happy childhood I did not have but why add another burden to the planet. The future is not sustainable. Country is legit on fire nature is dying. Basic truths or facts do not matter anymorejust stupid ass culture wars to bring in ratings and profit. I remember thinking the first time I wanted to die was when I was 8. Thought Id definitely be dead before college so why worry about that. Then oh once I achieve x y and z it will get better. It has to! How can humanity have gone this long if this is the reality? Yet here we are. Cool Existential dreadusa,Depression

I joined Reddit 3 days ago and since then I have had multiple messages and comments slating my appearance etc for literally no reason. I know its stupid but I really feel like shit now about myself and I know I am just going to dwell on it and things will go downhill.Does anyone have suggestions of how to get out of this mindset? I am worried about myself especially since I SH. Thank you for reading!!! Struggling tonight,Depression
7568,7588,This is my first post ever talking about my depression idk where to start. This past week I have been sick with a minor cold and while being sick it made me realize how much of a loser I am in life. I am currently unemployed and stressed about going back to community college knowing I lost my financial aid privilege from being a careless idiot in the past. My mom has spoiled me too much growing up and I took it for granted. It really hurts me to know I have not accomplished anything in life yet just to put a smile on her face. I had a job back in early May where I working a Physical Therapy Aide position but did not even last a month there. I thought I was doing fine until I got a phone call to not come into work anymore. I cannot even hold down a job ffs. No one in my family knows I got fired yet too embarrassed to tell them. I do not think I have lasted at any job for more than a year. I have been applying to a few places but no responses. I think I was meant to be a loser in life. Today was the first day I broke down completely in a long time when I came into a realization that I have pretty much 0 growth since I graduated high school back in 2017. Since middle school I always had low selfesteem. I never tried to man up. I was lucky enough to be in a 5year relationship w my high school love. My low selfesteem issues were the reason we went our separate ways when I would always decline invitations to do activities with other people. it is weird bc I do weight training at the gym every week since I was 17 and you would think that would build complete confidence but the selfesteem issues are still there. I wake up late everyday in my same depressing room open up my laptop and watch useless youtube videos gym come back home and do the same thing. I really have nobody to text or socialize with besides my sister. I would say my older sister is my only friend at the moment. She graduated from college a few years ago and works a job related to her career. She always gives me advice but I would brush it off bc I am too pussy to completely open up to her. I am going crazy. The day is almost over and what did i even do today? I am a little kid in a young adult's body 22year old in deep depression. Now starting to go crazy,Depression
7634,7654,Today is not a very good day and I just want to share it with someone who cares. I out of medication and it is very distressing that with just one day without meds can be really bad. I have been trying to contact with my doctor but she is not answering. I am feeling so alone. Sometimes I just want someone to asks me hey how are you?,Depression
7676,7696,My partner broke up with me. We dated for 8 months and were extremely co dependant. It was not a healthy relationship because she did not want to get better and I wanted her to. We met up and she is with someone else as soon as a month after an extreme alcoholic drinking 750mls every night and I am still in love with her.The breakup is what originally sent me into the depression but it was not just that. Where I live was going above and beyond with covid restrictions even though people were getting vaccinated and you would be fined for even seeing your family. My parents were being insane my brother was not doing well and it took a huge toll on me too. More than I know I think.Then I made the impulsive decision to get an apartment right after the breakup. The move in date is September 1st and as much as I should be happy that makes me even more depressed for some reason.I have no friends with depression I have no one that talks to me constantly my ex did so I am feeling extremely lonely after just getting cut off from that and I just feel so exhausted and alone. I want to go out but I want to be alone. I feel nothing literally nothing. I am just a numb husk that gets stuck in depressive thought loops over and over and wakes up to panic attacks.I have been in bed for over a week now my room is beyond disgusting I cannot eat and look like skin and bones and my Dad basically has to take care of me because I cannot. I have gone out once or twice but I feel nothing the whole time. I cannot live like this. I have clinical depression and have extremely intense depressive episodes multiple times a year but this is the worst one I have had since I was in fucking jr high. I am in college now. I think I am suicidal but I am so numb and empty I cannot even tell. The healthcare system in general let alone the mental healthcare where I live is abysmal but I am genuinely considering calling the crisis line and getting myself admitted to the mental health ward. The only thing stopping me is how much it would affect my family.I just feel so lost and SO alone and I do not know what to do. I think I came here to just talk to more people who are struggling like me but if you have any advice please let me know. I am so tired. I am in one of the worst depressive episodes of my life.,Depression
7694,7714,I am 20 doing undergraduate yet I cannot seem to study at all..I keep saying I will start my assignment or something in 30 minutes but the day passes and nothing. I end up forcing myself on the day if the deadline to get shit done..I spend my day playing video games scrolling through redditYouTube or sleeping..I prefer to skip a meal if I have to get out of my bed or sofa I feel too lazy to shower due to which I am showering once or twice a week... it is gotten to the point I sometimes brush my teeth in the afternoon or just forget to cuz i was too lazy to freshen up in the morning.Past couple years I used to be frustrated with myself how i keep forgetting stuff how i always procrastinate how I cannot achieve any goals how I am a disgrace to my family and usual stuff...but honestly now i do not feel that anymore so i guess I am over it..But then why am i living such a shitty life?

Well life has been steady. It is not as bad as others'. But i still want to die. I must be really ungrateful. I must have been overreacting. I am so confused right now. Do i really want to die?

7799,7819,If there is one thing I am certain it is the fact that I am feeling like I am straying further away from social interaction. I have been a complete shutin since my senior year in high school and now I am already a fulltime grinder. I used to force myself to go out and do things alone like go to a movie shopping cafe... yet for the past couple years I stopped doing so. Basically my routine is just wake up go to work now from home come back home to sleep. The rest I just spend on computer playing games or watching anime. I do have couple of friends that are still connected but that is all there is in my circle. I feel like I am just existing for the sakes of the existence itself and not living because to 'live' you need a purpose and I have got none. I exist but not living,Depression

7833,7853,Yesterday was the straw for me. My councillor had already advised me to try them because I just keep spiralling getting a boost from our session and then it all going out the window before the next session. I do not have any fuel for the fire I think there is something biological going on. After a vicious breakup and being just unable to make any ground for the last 7 months. Struggling with the constant voices in my head minor jobs just being overwhelming have been the run of the mill.But yesterday I flat out insulted a close friend. The only one who had really been there for me. He got a girlfriend just as I lost mine. I am full of bitterness and resentment. I have always been a good mate never want to step on toes. It was completely out of character and like watching a car crash in slow motion. Trying to push people away out of fear? Out of mercy because I think I am just draining to know? I have no idea.I verbally attacked him and his girlfriend who I have never met. Even talked shit because she had a kid with some else after they split and he went running back and looks after someone elses kid.But anyway called the doctor today. Got some anti depressants to hopefully help. Really scared of losing my libido but the horniness and want for my ex has also been torture. So maybe not a bad thing? Just less on my mind hopefully. Got my anti depressants. Absolutely dreading it.,Depression
7866,7886,I had been very anxious about certain aspects of my job and have been avoiding it for a long time.I was being paranoid and let my fear because me to freeze in place.Well today I overcame that fear and said fuck it. I checked emails and replied to my customers and now I am getting back into the groove of work.I was depressed for months unable to even stay awake. I slept 12 hours a day for nearly 2 months. I could not break out of that rut.I am not even really sure what changed today. Maybe it was anger. Maybe it was accepting that I hated how my life was at the moment and I was done staying in place day in and day out.But I wanted to share an encouraging story. Sending you all strength. I hope you find the strength to make it through another day and get even the smallest task done.If you do make sure you give yourself a good pay on the back. Proud of you for getting out of bed. For brushing your hair and teeth. For making that phone call. For cooking that meal. I did some good things today depression victory,Depression
7881,7901,it is hard. I am finding even when I am barely waking up my mind is already off to the races. In this constant search for some form of answer or conclusion as to where my inner critic became so harsh and what caused it.it is like my brain is constantly quantum computing trying to add up the traumas the emotions all these images that reside in my mind. Scanning calculating trying to figure out the absolute source but I know deep down there is no one source. That does not stop my brain from trying before that critic starts to scream some more. It will not be long but maybe I can track it. Figure out the reasons it surfaces but sometimes it just seems to be from nothing at all.it is a scary thought when your brain turns against you. That saying depression is like living with a body that tries to survive and a mind that tries to kill you I am paraphrasing because I do not know the exact quote but you get the idea. Take a breath,Depression
7922,7942,Since a child I have always neglected food. I am in my 20s m and was hoping Id grow out of it by now. I am quite thin and forget to eat regularly. I tell people I have eaten when I have not sometimes I buy food just to satisfy others and secretly throw it out. My stomach always aches and hurts I am not sure if its the lack of food or what is stopping me from eating I think both. It kills me to see my family and friends who constantly offer me food. Anyways I have been to over 10 specialists doctors probably more like 20 honestly and spent over 5k trying to get help but cannot seem to get over this. I think its partly medical and mentally related. Anyways rant over thanks. Any advice greatly appreciated and yes I have tried medicinal cannabis and lots of pharmacy meds. Body,Depression
7966,7986,I have been completely alone for about 3 years now. I live alone work a decent paying job and that is about it. I struggle to clean or do laundry or shower unless it has to do with work. I am responsible as far as work is concerned but cannot accomplish anything else at all in my life. I have thousands of dollars saved I live in a good area in a large house but every minute of every day is a struggle. I am really having to struggle to function each day. I think about ending it all often if barely not daily. Every friend has left. All the family is gone. Its just me and my cat and the main reason I do not end it is because I do not want him to eat me when no one notices I am gone. I need help. I have been alone so long,Depression
7991,8011,I have been with my partner for nearly 3 yrs now and we have never once had sex hes been really patient with me. While we have never had vaginal intercourse we have done other things and I sometimes struggle with depression bringing down my libido. But for weeks now I have been struggling having any sort of intimacy with him. Last time I broke down crying as we made out with his body over me he did not notice as the lights were out. And he began to move his hands and the combination of anxiety and fear of him feeling my cuts started self harming recently made me run I left immediately and told him I could not do it. Prior to that I have had tears run down before but this time it was more and I felt as if I was suffocating. I love him and I am attracted to him but when this happens it feels like I am not there almost like I am just watching myself but I have no control over my body. I know I can tell him to stop at any moment but it feels as if I am mute and cannot bring myself to do so. He does not even know I struggle with depression no one does he just thinks I am saving myself or waiting for the right time. We were relatively young when we started dating as well so it makes sense that we have not had any relations during the 3 yrs. its scary when I disassociate I know hes someone I trust and love but it feels like rape in a way. I am not comparing the two but I do feel powerless and its not even his fault. I cannot be intimate,Depression
8002,8022,I haveLiterallyDoneNothingAll dayThese past couple days I thought could finally start to work on something at least do what I enjoy doingBut then I realizedI do nothing but lay in bed and stare at my phone the whole dayNot even doing social media I just... WatchI do not care what I watch as long as it makes me numb to this painEven just... Sitting down on my pc feels bad now I immediately feel tired and I want outI constantly feel like a complete idiot because I have something I want to do I have ideas but then when I want to do it it is like I transform in a completely different person uncapable of everything and it is so frustrating because if only I could do it... I may have a chance to see the light again And I feel upsetMy anxiety is so bad that I want to do nothing but eat until I cannot anymore which is impossibleAnd I cannot exercise because the moment I think about it I cry I get angry and want to do nothing else but self harm does any of my family members care about it? No they continue to bully me about my weight and threaten me to get over my feelings about itWhat am I?Is this really real life?Because I want outI really want my life to be over because I am not using it on anything and nothing will ever feel good again I was an idiot and believed that things could turn betterBut the world is not the problemMy circumstances are not the problemI am the problemAnd problems have to disappear Worthless,Depression
8026,8046,I will try to make this as short as possible. I have always had problems with finding something that I like and doing it in excess not just drugsalcohol even good things. I am 25 years old I did not drink until I got to college and I liked it but did not love it. While living on campus you of I I drank often but I would not say more than any other college kid. Cocaine was another story. It came around a few times and i was quickly doing it A LOT. every night type of a lot. I was able to stop that on my own somehow. Alcoholism runs in my family although never effected my parents because they were careful. About 5 months ago I started drinking and it very quickly got out of hand. Like almost a fifth a night out of hand. Its leading to issues that have started to get worrisome. I own a lot of guns and I have started becoming somewhat suicidal. Its like alcohol woke something in me. I have always been on anti depressants. I have not seen the girl I have dated for the last 6 years in a month and she basically hates me now. I do not want clinical help I want to tackle this like I always have for everything else. Does anybody have advice on how they fixed this on their own? I am sorry if asking for that is frowned upon but I want to control this on my own. I posted this in another sub incase this is not allowed here but any advice would be very appreciated. I really need some advice,Depression
8110,8130,All this work all this pressure that everyone puts on you to succeed. To go to a good college get a good job the normal things a lot of parents ask. All for what? I work my entire life and then what? Am I supposed to enjoy my ofttimes from studying or working being an ugly socially awkward loser? Not able to talk to anyone have friends even when doing normally enjoyed things video games time off etc. all I can think about is how everyone else is probably enjoying their time with other people. Am I working for something or am I just working for the sake of working just because everyone tells me that is what I am supposed to do. Do people only tell you it gets better for the sake of having one more wage slave satisfy their demand for goods? What is this all for? All for what?,Depression
8138,8158,I know that what I think can be kind of stupid to most of you because the fact that I am not good at math makes me feel kind of depressed I was like below average in middle school and the same thing even in high school the problem is that when it comes to very difficult equations and problems my brain just cannot handle all that shit.The thing is that in my country almost all universities have at least 1 math exam even humanistic ones let alone technical and scientific ones.So if you are bad at math like me you have almost no chance of ever getting a degree that will garantee you a decent job or even getting a degree in general...I see everyone my age studying things I could never understand and I kind of feel inferiormuch more stupid compared to them.I know this is a very unusual feeling but that is what I feel about myself being a lot because in the Education world Not being good at math really penalises you in the university world,Depression
8187,8207,I love sleep it is like a teaser trailer for death. I use to escape with drugs which I enjoyed alot but these days I cannot really enjoy them because I am older and my body is in shit condition and it irritates my system. Gaming barely works as a escape I really wish we had more advance VR these days that was indistinguishable from real life but that is at least a decade away or more. I do not know about you guys but sleep is pretty much my last great place I can escape from my shitty reality. Sleep the last great escape,Depression
8195,8215,I was diagnosed with a thyroid tumor about 2 years ago but stopped showing up at the hospital soon after. I am 21 now. have not told about it to my parents yet because I do not want to be a burden even though I know they deserve the truth.I have been horribly ashamed of my life decisions since I was around 17 or even earlier.I work at a dead end job and the only reason I show up is out of fear of having to move back in with my parents They did make some questionable choices when I was growing up but out of love for meI am still in love with a girl I never told about my feelings.Probably just the idea of her but it is hard to tellI make plans but never follow through.I let some of my friends to take advantage of me as I rarely stand up for myself.I have done a lot of drugs to hide the pain and forget about my mistakes and regrets.The only time I am honest is when I am drunk or high Except right now I guess which is weird...I do have dreams and aspirations though but I set myself such high standards that It makes me paralyzed.No matter how many selfhelp books I read or selfreflection I do I am still unable to ask for help. But I really do want help. Help me. Please just help me?Help!Tldr I am a procrastinating hypocriteIt does feel great to write this even if I do not end up posting it. Sorry for my language skills I am not a native.Ps. Go get vaccinated please I will not probably make it but you might and the next waves that come will kill the economy. Or maybe it deserves to die before it can be rebuilt on some better foundations. The only thing I am not procrastinating with is living,Depression
8239,8259,I believe that I am just a fat useless worthless autistic loser. My whole life was a disaster from childhood up to now. I was bullied my whole life eventually online for 3 years as well. I was not the best kid either because I was immature and had a temper which I still do. In college nobody liked me because I was different due to my autism. Same with 2 High School bands and every job I had. So basically I was hated my entire life. there is no point in me having a career in anything either because nobody will ever hire me so there is no point in trying. I truly believe that I deserve to die what is the point?,Depression

8286,8306,I have been working from home since the pandemic began and still live with parents.Since then I have hardly left the house or seen friends and feel like both my mental and physical health have been impacted tremendously. I am not very outgoing and do not have a partner so I do not really have any reason other than work or going out with friends to leave the house. But staying in the house all the time makes me feel like I have been missing out on really important life events.I have noticed over the past year it is been getting harder and harder to wake up in the mornings and throughout the day it just feels like a slog. I have become very distant from the work I am doing and do not take it as seriously anymore. It does not really feel like work at this point just something I happen to do during the day. Everyday's the same and when something goes wrong I feel quite intimidated because I feel like it is invading my private space.I have tried writing and wanted to exploit home working to give me an opportunity to really practice my skills but it is been a disaster and I have not written a single story since the pandemic began. it is my aspiration to be a writer and I feel like I have just flushed it down the toilet. My mood has completely turned me off writing altogether and it just feels pointless at this stage. It sucks too because I get pretty excited about it.In February and March I was having major suicidal thoughts and although they have went away the odd feeling pops back into my head which makes me worry that one of these days I am going to do something to myself. I have tried to make use of mental health resources but I do not really feel like I want to help myself I check out a website or have a chat with someone and then I drop it again until I have another depressive nosedive. I also contacted a therapist last year but I was not comfortable with phone or video chat therapy due to privacy issues.I badly want to have meaning in life but right now it feels like I live for other people and I am really not enjoying work right now. it is not even the work itself it is just the thought of doing it. Recently we have been pretty quiet but sitting around doing nothing all day does not help either. there is talk of going back to the office which I think might help if I get back into a routine again but most of my colleagues do not want to go back so I am worried I will be alone plus it is dependent on if we really need to go into the office which we really do not as we have shown we can work from home and Covid cases. there is also certain aspects about office working that I think I will struggle to get used to again so I feel pretty divided. Covid has completely destroyed my social skills.Sorry if this is a massive rant I am not exactly sure what to write but I just feel pretty down right now. it is late and I cannot sleep which is when my mind goes on a tangent and attacks itself. I just want to feel like I have some sort of meaning in life and something to hold onto and develop. I was hoping that thing would be my writing but I do not feel like touching it right now because of how unmotivated I feel. I feel like the last year has been an absolutely waste of time and I just feel very replaceable and blank at this point. Feel like life is on hold due to working from home,Depression
8296,8316,Hi my names Isaac and I am here to tell my story of depression anxiety and stress. Currently I am 15 years old and these 3 sins somehow disrupted my body it all started through 1 strawberry edible in May 1st and my mom gave me Xanax for me to calm my self down from the edible and it worked because it knocked me out for the whole day. But the next day my left side of my chest was hurting bad and it scared me because it felt like a heart attack and I had a panic attack so I had to go to the hospital I got their they checked me out and my blood pressure was 180120 but the doctors told me to calm down and gave me a pill and sent me on my way but the day after that my sides was hurting again and I was scared like I was going to have a heart attack again and then I went to the hospital again for the same reason the doctors did an EKG on my heart and they said everything was normal and my blood pressure was little high again I think it was 140 but then they sent me on my way again but If you guys did not know my parents are currently going thru a divorce too so yeah. But couple weeks later my left side of my chest still hurting but wait I start to get lightheaded more afton now and I had also got tested positive for COVID too now that is crazy shit. I got thru COVID and blah blah these symptoms still happening and there making me depressed because it scares me to think I have to live with these symptoms forever and I do not want to and it scares and makes me get depressed with life and i go to the doctors for this and she prescribed me serpentine and suggests I get counseling but I want to know your guys opinions plz lmk this stuff is eating me Alive Help me find my cure,Depression
8346,8366,I do not want to have a job. I do not want to shower. I do not want to clean my room. I do not want to exercise. I do not want to do almost everything. Why? Because I am not masochist that is why.I also do not have anhedonia. Everything is boring because it is. Do you mean I could just play the same game for eternity without getting bored? Get real.I do not like life I do not have any hobbies and I have my reasons. People should stop telling me I am depressed and that I should see a therapist. do not guilttrip me. there is nothing wrong with me. Accept different opinions. I do not have depression.,Depression
8369,8389,All this time I knew something was wrong but I never really knew what. I thought I hated my body I thought that I was sad because the boy I liked did not like me I thought I was sad because my parents never understood me. But those were all the things I would tell other people when they asked if I was okay although I never really cared about any of that. The truth is I do not really feel anything. I try to pretend I care about things to seem normal to other people and I pretended for so long that I ended up believing my own lies. I was so out of touch with my feelings I had no idea I was actually depressed I thought I was living life the way it is supposed to be lived but it never felt right. I have never taken my future seriously in fact I have never taken anything in my life seriously. I got arrested for shoplifting and while my friend cried I started laughing because I really could not care. I do not care about my studies I only have good grades because I am asked to. I do not even feel happy or proud when I get a good grade. I do not have any real life project or expectations for my future. I have been living all this time letting other people decide for me because I do not really want anything. Nothing motivates me. When I was a child I liked to draw to read to write. None of those things motivate me anymore. I thought I was happy because I partied I drank O smoked weed and hung out with my friends. I thought I was happy because those things made me feel alive. When I am alone I just pretend I am living a different life but I never thought that was fucked up because I thought it was normal. I want to know if people that are not depressed experience life differently. Do they seriously care about things? Everytime something bad happens to me it is almost like it happens to someone else. I feel emotions as if I was deep inside of the ocean and there were muffled sound coming form the outer world. it is almost like I drown my own emotions. If someone insults me if someone hurts me if someone rejects me I never really cry about it or feel sad or anything at all. it is like I have become numb.Nothing makes sense. Nothing here makes sense. it is like I do not know how to be alive. I thought it was completely normal to go to sleep late to eat too much or too little to feel tired all the time to never be able to concentrate. But now some stupid online test tell me that those are symptoms of depression. I thought everybody was just pretending like I did. This is such a different type of depression. I have experienced hate for myself I have experienced anxiety and hate for my body. I thought THAT was depression and the nothingness and the pretending were all just part of my personality just the way I was born. I do not know how to be different I do not know my feelings or myself. I do not really know or want or feel anything. it is the strangest feeling and I know it is been there all the time but I never recognized until now. I think I have been depressed for years but I did not know,Depression
8389,8409,I do not know why I wake up in the morning. I find it hard coz I got nothing to look forward to.The melancholia drowns me when I realize how alone I am choking depression grips me.ampx200Bdo not have a dad mom's got her own battles. How the fuck could I have turned out normal?Sensory overload is too much sometimes so I numb myself with drugs and alcohol. What else was an empathetic overly sensitive kid supposed to turn to for support when the humans would give no love?ampx200BI suppose I should count the blessings I have had as well as few as they may be.My grandparents being there for me kept me going although its not like I did not try the easy way out when they were around.ampx200BNow I got no one nothing.Mom's still fighting her battles I try to help but I cannot save her from herself. Rest of the relatives cousins and uncles and aunts sometimes they were a blessing often they were not. Love life How can I love life when I have not had a love life since a long long time. But I guess that was my fault for loving someone 8000 miles away. Now I do not feel like trying it feels like a waste of time. Am I loveless? Or do I just love less? Since love left I have nothing left to feel Home by Passenger As for friends the good ones are gone the rest are busy with their own lives. Loyalty does not mean anything anymore everyone is ready to turn on a dime. I had hoped that the bridges I had to burn would light the way but the path seems to be getting darker the more I look at it.ampx200B I can write a million words and fill a hundred books with the thoughts that run through my mind but in no coherent order. But then I wonder who the fuck wants to listen to a loser's tale. I feel like a loser because in spite of the gift of brilliance that was bestowed upon me I have accomplished nothing of significance. It frustrates me to look in the mirror and see such a mighty being reduced to a pitiful product of the environment. A lot of people find solace in chasing money and I know its important because I have never had any. But more important is a purpose in life that is what gives it meaning.ampx200BI live another day to persevere and find my way.But if I do not find it the reset button is just a dive away. Cornucopia of Jumbled Thoughts Should I go on?,Depression
8409,8429,I am sorry if this is not the right subreddit to post direct me to go somewhere else if it is not So i went to the psychiatrist today with the expectation to get prescribed some stimulants or take some test that will get me some point is i got diagnosed with major depressive disorder and i was prescribed Zoloft I did not lie to the psychiatrist told her all about past and my current situation I am honestly not even that depressed I am pretty functional I am outside everyday i have random bouts of 1 hour depression but that is it I have a lot to look forward to I am just honestly confused Diagnosed today with major depressive disorder,Depression
8433,8453,I just moved states with my partner they had a great job offer and I am still finishing my masters so we headed out with plans Id get a bartending gig. And I did for about a week before I was fired for not being a good fit. The wording definitely stung. I immediately spiraled panic attack going wide with my failures cannot keep a job cannot do anything right etc. My partner was great and supportive but its hard to crack that nagging voice of worthlessness in the back of my head. I am good at my job so being fired for what I can only assume is a dislike of me in particular feels... devastating. I want to be a writer. I am working on my thesis for my masters. Yet losing a job I have had for less than two weeks has leveled me and its hard to see any value I bring to my relationship society etc if I cannot keep a fucking bartending gig. Fired while Depressed,Depression
8457,8477,I am 25F. I was diagnosed with depression at 12 and borderline personality disorder at 23. It comes and goes but when its bad its BAD. Things are not going amazing in my life at the moment but also not particularly bad either. But i feel like I am in a serious slump.I have tried therapy multiple times in the last 13 years multiple different therapists and approaches but it honestly has never done anything for me at all.I have been on SO many different medications throughout the years and finally am on one that helps more than the others but still not fully. Nobody in my family deals with any mood disorders so they are not very understanding when i do go through slumps so i feel like I am not taken seriously and no one truly understands how bad i feel.I also do not want to try therapy again for the simple fact that i cannot afford it. I make too much for Medicaid and even with good insurance i was paying almost 300 out of pocket twice a month just for therapy alone not including my general appointments for my medication.I really only have 3 people i can talk to. One being my boyfriend of 6 years who is supportive and as helpful as he can be but given the fact hes never struggled with it himself he does not really understand. The other is my best friend who is honestly not the greatest friend in general and i feel like i bother her when i talk to her. The last person is my sister but she picks and chooses when she wants to listenhelp.I hate burdening people with my issues and i feel that is all i do. But i also feel like I am going to lose my mind. do not really know what to do anymore,Depression
8464,8484,I am done. I have had enough of this crappy life and everything in it. I have had enough of people not caring. I have had enough of being alone. I do not want my life anymore. Goodbye,Depression
8469,8489,I have to wash clothes do dishes clean kitchen floor blah blah blah but I can barely get myself to do it. I can barely start chores for today.,Depression
8486,8506,I have no right to be depressed. Over the past decade I have fixed my life mostly. I went to college got my degree got a great job with fantastic coworkers... But that does not take away from the fact that I did in my 40s what I should have done in my 20s.I am looking back at a wasted life and seeing things that I will never achieve now. Getting married? Having kids? Pft... I did not do it in the past because I was not going to subject anybody to the immature shitshow that was my life and I am not doing it now because I do not want to subject anybody to the immature depression that is my life. My meds are helping me to not break down crying on a regular basis but they do not take away the hard truth that my life is almost over and it was wasted.Starting my life so late is also putting me in the wrong peer group. The friends that I had from high school until my mid40s are no longer a part of my life. Right now my very best friend is nearly half my age. All of my coworkers are also young Millennials. Some are even Gen Z. My belief structures are more Millennial than Gen X as are my interests. I am currently watching Avatar and Shera for fucks' sake. Funny thing? I am not suicidal. I have a crippling fear of death. Nonexistence just scares the hell out of me. I just want more time... Or to take back what I wasted. My coworkers accept me and include me in their social lives but I cannot help but think that I am just some creepy old guy hanging out with kids... Kids in their midtolate 20s but still. We get along our interests are the same... But I do not belong. Then again I also do not belong with most of Gen X either. I am just a fucking mess right now and need to vent. Sorry for wasting your time I am turning 50 in a few days and I am depressed as f about how I have wasted my life,Depression
8499,8519,If I go to mental health and seek help for depression will they discharge me from active duty? I only ask because I want to commission after this enlistment and would not want to ruin my chances. Military members,Depression
8531,8551,My depression is only getting worse. I feel like everyone in my life has not given up on me and I think I have given up on me too. I wish I had the guts to end my life right now. No point anymore,Depression
8563,8583,This is going to be a long and not first post on this subreddit.I am a 22 year old man and even though I do not like it either when these posts start with a list of things people do not like about themselves they suffer from eucharist syndrome I am going to I believe these are in relation with my problems. I am gay autistic virgin pursuing a useless degree we will return to this no driving lisence barely any money under on my name and below minimum wage income. My future is looking bleak and tbh worse than that of everyone around me. Though they can only help so much. I have yet to find the passion drive or whatever that makes you go from point a to point b in my life.Who can tell well it all went wrong? My tiger mom? Maybe. My emotionally distant dad? Who knows. Sheltering and undersocialisation? Maybe. I have been dealing with depression and suicidial ideations since age 10. My parents made me go to a foreign language school they wanted me to mingle with other elite kids which so to speak was the most traumatic experience of my life crying and begging my parents not to make me go there can you guess wheter they listened? I was bullied daily for 10 years of my life.Everyday of school was a struggle to say I got used to this is an understatement. Even in my head I cannot find my own place in life regular panic attacks and feelings of dread come in every month or so demoralising and demotivating.Recently got an internship in a business consulant company where I constanly underpeform due to lack of knowledge in economics drive and the problems listed above. I got the position on the promise that I will start a Finance BSc next semester. If being late in life in other aspects already was not enough I am graduating with a BSc at 26 which makes me feel terrible. The feelings of dread and inadequacy just cumulate and I am getting close to being overwhelmed. Wierdly enough in times like this I want to talk and meet my mom. I want to get back into the womb where its warm and safe unlike outside here sheltering sheltering. I have wonderful friends and family members who love and support be but being so much behind in life compared to them and not being able to keep their advices in my head makes me feel terrible. Since my experience with most things is utter failure it does not make for a good though pattern does it? Afraid of life and in general of everything but wierdly enough people see me as normalacting sic! I guess at least I was always good at masking.This is one of my dreadful periods each is worse than the previous. Feeling more lost than ever positive thoughts occuring less and less. I really want this to end. Thank you. TLDR Years of abandonment avoidance and deperssion resulted into a warped sense of reality which is selffulfilling. What an ellaborate way to say I am depressed.PS. There were ofc lot of things I did not mention which mounted up to this state of mine but I consider those a result not a because. Thus unimportant. CW Suicide Why I might commit suicide very soon advice and consultation welcome!,Depression
8570,8590,I am grateful for everything I have in life I genuinely believe I am blessed. Yet I feel empty and sad all the time. I never used to be like this until 2017. Its been like that for years now and it just will not go away. I had a expectation of how my adult life would turn out but I am still not satisfied. I was told twenties would be your most fun for me its the most depressing at most times. When I do enjoy life in the moment it kind of gets ruined by the thought knowing it will not last forever. I am really grateful for my so hes very supportive and understanding yet I still feel constant sadness.. I am not suicidal but I always feel empty and nothing. I hate this feeling and it makes me cry at some nights whereas other nights I cannot cry at all. Anyways.. I just want rant on here. Its my first time posting on this app. I have everything I want but I am still constantly depressed.,Depression
8578,8598,Hi everyone this is my first post here and I am just feeling so tired and unmotivated. I do not even feel like going to my therapist anymore. I feel pathetic saying its too much effort because its literally over zoom but its just too much. I do not feel like talking about my problems anymore. I just feel like forgetting about them. she is a lovely therapist but I just do not want to deal with this anymore. I just feel so sad lately its almost becoming to the point of numbness. Luckily I do not live with my parents anymore so they do not physically notice. I barely shower anymore unless I have to. I hate brushing my teeth my room and bathroom are disgusting I cannot even find the motivation to make myself food anymore. I am in so much debt right now and my boss was talking to me about getting a promotion at work and then she just went over and handed it to someone else. I just want to disappear. Not even necessarily wanting to die but I just want to be gone and not have to deal with my life anymore. Just so tired,Depression
8580,8600,Feeling less motivated by the day. Use to heavily train at gym almost everyday now thought of putting myself through all that taxing work makes me groan internally. do not like looking in mirror despite being objectively good lookinghot or taking time to self analyze. Feel lazy and just want to smoke weed and do nothing. have not had a relationship in 7 years since fucking middle school have not gotten laid in a year have more fingers on 1 hand than I do friends.And the hate for myself is growing every single day. I may have people around that want to help but I would never and will never confide to them. They will never understand what I am going through or why. I think depression is upon me,Depression
8603,8623,Hello everyoneI am considering starting psychotherapy again. I have received psychodynamic psychotherapy for about 3.5 years but it helped up to a point as its main goal is to make the client realize and be conscious of mental patterns and act on them. I am looking for new ways to heal myself. Basically even if there is nothing going on I feel constant anguish distress anxiety and existential pain. I see no meaning of life at all but this is not due to my psychology but my philosophical approach to life. I am an existentialist in a way. Plus to me there is no meaning of suffering in life as other toxic positive people claim that suffering makes us strong bla bla. Why would I suffer? I want to have fun in life which also leads to laziness for me sometimes. However my feelings are generally negative. How can I overcome my anguish anxiety and distress? Is there helpful approach of psychotherapy for me? I am also in an alert state all the time that other people might harmhurt me due to survival instincts for instance in business or for money. This also causes my anxiety. ampx200BI appreciate any thought idea and help. Thank you How can I overcome my feelings of anguish distress anxiety and existential pain?,Depression
8606,8626,Fuck this world fuck 99 of the people in it let us hope everything burns and falls apart because this bullshit notion that there is kindness and quality is absolute horseshit.I am tired of people say be kind and the universe will reciprocate none of that is true you have to be a terrible person who does terrible things in order to get ahead. Forget about being a quality human being there never was such a thing. People need to start doing negative actions in order to rectify all the wrongs going on. You are not in control of anything and instead are just a pawn in a bullshit mirage of happiness. There is no point in helping anyone there is no point in doing anything positive except for animals who cannot help themselves. People are fucking disgusting and I have zero empathy or sympathy for any being anymore. Millions suffer from depression and sadness and nothing is changing. In order to change anything be a nasty person and take what you can because that is how happy people live. Be evil like a Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates lie about having a good exterior and ravage everything you can because nothing good comes from being a good person. Drop the anxiety ravage what you can this place is a dump for anger and terror. The time for empathy is gone fuck this world and fuck anyone who says you have to fight for goodness. There is no goodness only shit people saying shitty things. Fuck money fuck owning a home fuck going to the movies fuck listening to music fuck an education fuck helpless people because there is no helping them. Fuck it all and I hope the world burns today not tomorrow not next week fucking burn today. Fuck being good or kind its all a mirage.,Depression
8646,8666,I always read that telling people you trust is the best option for getting help but it just feels meaningless when they tell me I should think about my future and how I should fight for my life when I am suicidal. Literally all I see for my future is suicide and if not then unemployed pathetic still relying on my parents etc. I feel like a baby that is not trying and I am convinced that I really am just lazy and not trying but why should I when I see no point in it. I plan to kill myself soon anyways. None of it will matter. You just get mad and insult or laugh at me when I tell you that so I will not and your eyes are always filled with judgement. I do not get why you do not want to tell me to kill myself instead of going through the struggle of telling me why I should not Telling me to fight for my life will not work since I am suicidal,Depression
8652,8672,I have not been able to sleep because I have been constantly crying. Heck I am still fucking crying. Just last night me and my sister finally spoke up against my mother. My mothers always been putting us down and telling us about how much she is sacrificed for us and I know I am supposed to feel grateful but the way she says it makes me feel like I am a financial burden and all this degrading has like internalized into a deep self hatred over the past 15 years. I had just graduated college and honestly I really cannot afford to live on my own because of my health conditions and that my state is very costly to live in. I would not be able to afford living on my own unless I risk my health and risk losing my dream of being able to do art. My hands will not be usable if I had to work 2 or more minimum wage jobs. And last night was just the final straw. I am so fucking sick of the same fucking shit and its like nothing I do enough is good enough to satisfy her. Oh you got good grades? Well my coworkers daughter was valid Victorian. Oh you are studying art? Well its not going to get you work and I know my coworkers daughters who are nurses now and make so much money. I just want to have some even if its just a little validation like maybe a good job or something but all I get is 15 years of self hatred a loss of my will to live. I swear the only few reasons I am still around are just personal projects obligations to hang out with people and the fear of death but at this point idk if I can take this shit much longer. I just want someone to tell me that I am not a failure. Is that too much to ask? I feel like no matter what I do its never good enough and if I want to do something Id end up where I started,Depression
8662,8682,I would be preaching to the choir if I explained how much pain I feel or how bleak things are. Can anybody share some quick tips on why I should stay alive or how I can? I do not think life is worth it and my mind is just mangled How can I keep living?,Depression
8675,8695,I have terrible anxiety. My parents will not allow me therapy. I do not have money nor the means to afford therapy. And I feel that I have repressed anger and depression. I am always thinking or overthinking most of the time. What must I do to recover or release this anxiety. I am not allowed to leave my house. So something I can do indoors will help alot. Thank you I want to learn how to release anxiety.,Depression
8691,8711,Why does this always happen I do not even know what i expect to happen why do i even bother to talk just fck all of this I hate when people i open up to start diagnosing me,Depression
8835,8855,Well me I am not that type person to talk abt my feelings just thought that maybe there will be some one who can understand what I mean actually its really hard to explain I feel like that is why I cannot get any help I just want to die but I am so scared to die because I do not know what is next what is after this world were in Rn I am just so lonely have nobody to talk to i have no friends and everything else its just so heavy I am only 14 I do not really know if I am supposed to be having these thoughts I have a lot more to say but I am sleepy lol goodnight Sad,Depression
8838,8858,i have goals and ideas that I have been wanting to pursue since forever but i still just cannot get myself to do anything. whenever i have free time i opt for the most comforting activity rather than something productive. and my biggest problem is that when i finally buckle down to do something productive i stop when things begin to get hard. I am just so lazy. i know depression plays a big role in why I am like this but idk. i want to better myself so so unmotivated to do anything,Depression
8845,8865,Why do we even love people when they are always bound to leave and we tend to screw up relationships even when we loved them?The pain is just way too much. I cannot deal with it anymore. As someone who never felt love before to see the person you loved with all your heart leave and that too owing to your own fault is extremely heartbreaking. Although I am numb to the pain now I do not think I can function properly anymore. I just want to talk to someone anyone. Please. why does love exist?,Depression
8864,8884,on paper my life is good and i will acknowledge that but I have just lost any willpower i have to try anymore. i do not really feel like i have a purpose in life. i smoke weed all the time just to feel something. i go through these weird cycles where i get super depressed then feel back to normal and then ill get super depressed again and bc I have noticed that pattern i do not really feel like getting out of the depression. why the fuck would i just want to crash and burn and inevitably start feeling depressed again i just do not give a fuck anymore,Depression
8936,8956,I apologize in advance for any spelling mistakes and other errors i will probably make.Well the post title is just that living is fun and all sometimes but i just cannot handle it anymore. No matter what i try i either end up hurting myself more in the progress or failing miserably from the beginning.I applied for roughly 30 jobs in the last two months and almost got rejected from everyone because i had a burnout in my senior year due to my teacher and my sister moving out. And the ones where I actually managed to get an interview quickly shut me down because i got self harm scars from when i was younger.And ofc the only way i know how to get rid of this shit is either SH or drowning out my sorrows in videogames and just pretending it did never happen.But that is not the part that makes me not be alive anymore i got an emotionally abusive mother and an physical abbusive father the occasional kick or punch i can deal with but it my mother who really hurts me. Every single time something is missing in the house Dosent matter what it is. I get accused of taking it eating it or having it last and thus loosing it. Followed up by a verbal assault of what a disappointment i am how useless i am and how she sometimes wishes she would have aborted me.I often considered running away atleast to a friend or atleast the unemployment office to get away from here. But the last time i brought up living with a friend for a month she ran into my parents room threatening to kill herself if i moved away.In the last couple of weeks it has been extra rough for me idk why but i just cannot seem to let go of the past. Like rn i just lay in bed trying to fall asleep but just cannot and keep doing stuff to drown out the memories of my best friend simply using me to get closer to crush to date her and then botch ditching me.Another friend of mine just using me for money because she knew i needed someone and that i would buy her things just to not leave me alone again.Seeing my best friend since middle school slowly getting addicted to drugs until he killed himself.My first gf cheating on me and even afterwards telling me how good it felt.And tbh the thing that hurts the most is Hannah she was a friend of my GF and me at the time and when shit hit the fan she was there for me i cried so fucking much during that time and she was there for me i tried to be the best friend i could at that time cheering her up even though I was fucked myself. But apparently i did not do good enough of a jobIt would be better for all of us if you finally killed yourself That still sticks with me today i think about it every single time i get closer to someone every time i talk to a friend. That maybe they all think so and she was right that i should stop beeing such a pussy and finally kill myself.Its funny that i kept this to almost last tbh maybe its because i do not really want to talk about it or because it happened at such a young age that is its practicaly a part of me at this point when i was i think 8 or 9 I was sexually assaulted by an older classmate i think 11 or 12 I am sorry for the numbers.At first it Started out as playing then someday he just undressed and acted like nothing was wrong and suggested we play doctors and such idk what is he called it I am sorry. Idk it just kind of happened and then stopped someday when he switched schools. I cannot have a bodily relationship with anyone if someone hugs me without asking and telling me beforehand i get panic attacks when i layed in bed once with a friend of mine i had to get up because i just could not stay next to bed in ber and feel scared.I just do not want to live with all this fucking baggage anymore every single day seems to get worse and worse. And there is nothing i can do about it.I am sorry if you read this you should not have but i just needed somewhere to write this downI just do not want all this fucking baggage Sometimes i just do not want to live anymore or atleast not as myself.,Depression

My brain cannot be helped. Anything good I do it tells me its worthless because I could have done it sooner but now its too late.Become wealthy? you are 20 should have achieved that at max 18.Create beautiful successful projects? Meh there are teens building the future since they are 12 you are too late.Anything I do its not good enough.I do not expect kind comments or any comments at all I just wanted to pour my soul out to somebody.I am hanging by a thread and nobody sees it.

8981,9001,if we all came together in real life we could make a depressland state. how you would like depressland to look like? I feel wrong I just cannot believe there are 777000 of us depressed and there is nothing we can do about it together.,Depression
8989,9009,I feel done. I think I am done.Nothing seems exciting it feels like the world has lost color. I do not know why I am here. I have a job and according to my friends that would make me feel better.I am done I am done taking up space I am done feeling like I am too much. I do not want to be here anymore Done,Depression

So as my psychotherapist in vacations I want to know what are my options before I discuss them with him Anti depressors are not effectives anymore and I am already at a very high dosage what is the options I have ?,Depression
9012,9032,This year things seemed to be doing good finally got on t and mood started to stabilize to the point where I was not having meltdowns in broom closets at work dailyNow into the summer it comes backYear before this was in inpatient because I was hearing shit that was not there and decided to hospitalize myself because it was making me suicidal Year before that was out on leave for 4 months again around the same time of year late summerlate November that time because my doctor upped the dosage of a medication that fucked up my mood dissorder severelyYear before that was because I was suicidal was pre t hospital staff threatened to tackle me if I did not remove my chest flattening garment and kept me in a hallway full of strangers and misgendered me the entire time had a meltdown in front of said strangers who began to openly mocked me. I cannot afford to keep hospitalizing myself and if I try to just go back to my job I am going to end up killing myself there is nearly a 100 foot drop from the balcony to the floor in the building I am working in I have thought about it I have never gone too far but have had attempts through other means. it is going to be complaining and saying hey something is wrong and I need actual financial support and therapy from someone trained to handle trauma in a way that is not just telling me I have anxiety and that what is going on is normal I need help or I am going to die and no one will take me seriously until it actually happens. The only reason I am not dead now is because the thought of people going wow we had no idea this would happen makes me physically ill. cannot fucking do this shit anymore always back to square one,Depression
9044,9064,So a lot is going on. I am about to finish grad school and I should be happy but I am not. I am beyond depressed. I have so much going on right now. I have applied to 6 or 7 jobs and have not even gotten 1 interview. I have very little work experience in my field. My sister is about to move to college. My brother wants to move out and go to trade school. I do not know how to drive. do not know what is next for me. My family feels like its falling apart and I feel like I am drowning. I have never had a full time job or even a demanding job. I feel like a waste of human existence. I do not know what to do,Depression
9058,9078,I 28f am coming off of medications and quitting my copying mechanism of cannabis. I have lost all interest in life. Doing hobbies hanging out with people watching tv hell even mindlessly scrolling on reddit. I just do not have the energy to even care. Iv tried doing things to help me. I looked for places to basketball this morning but of course I could not find any open courts or just play around on. So that got me down even more. The only thing Iv wanted to do in the past week I could not and I felt like its such an easy thing. But none of the deck areas around town has courts and then the gym I was going to sign up for. Literally signing the paper work looking though the window at the court. And the desk girl was like oh btw were going to be closed for a month starting on Friday so of course I was not going to pay for a month that I could not even use. Trying to eat better to give me the nutrients to feel better but I do not even have the energy to pull out the pre made salad I bough at the store. I just want to feel interested in something again and happy and excited to do things. I know this is supposed to be temporary but man it feels so shitty and I am worried habits will form that I cannot break. Of just being a lazy sak Advice on loosing interest,Depression
9062,9082,My emotions or lack of scare me. Over the past couple of months I have noticed that I just seem to care less and less. Literally anything could happen to me or around me and I do not know why but nothing seems to make me feel normal emotions. Two events made me super aware of my new emotional numbness. A couple months ago I got into a bad accident with my mother and she was freaking out and crying and I just sat there. I was not scared or sad or in shock. I was sitting in a wrecked car ready to continue the trip and move on to the next destination. Then the other time was when my dad was mad at me for something and he yelled at me and told me how disappointed he was and I again just sat there staring at him. Even after he left I just sat there then continued on with what I was doing. I feel like maybe I might be going crazy because of how numb I am sometimes. But at the same time I like being numb because I do not like having to feel. I struggle to have emotions sometimes a little rant,Depression
9065,9085,I am even an outsider in my own family. I try to fit in with friends until it becomes abundantly obvious that I am not really part of the group and they do not care about methen i leave and try and find a new group. What is so wrong with me that I have never fit in anywhere in my life Always feel like an outsider,Depression
9066,9086,I still live with my parents and I want to change my major. I am very unhappy with the major i chose. My mom says its too late now and that i must graduate and find a job. I have not given up so I am studying to a very important exam to get accepted in a new major but its so hard to study the whole day and not flunk in the classes that I take in college. I do not have much free time at all.I do not haven many friends never dated. I am too socially awkward. I gained 10kg in the quarantine. I feel that I am ugly now and that I will die alone and unhappy. Sometimes I think about dying and just wish I was never born. I am 22 and have gotten nowhere.,Depression
9068,9088,I do not get it. I do not get why i feel this way. I have a mom who loves me and who i love to death a dad that cares about me. A sibling who looks up to me. I am 15 I have been going to therapy since last year.She said i got better she said my aura had changed she said i seem happier and that was true for some time but now i do not even know. I do good in school i have 3 friends who love me. Who i told that i hate myself. I am a white middle class girl who lives in a safe town. But yet i find my self crying for no reason. I find myself feeling numb and on the verge of breakdowns when hanging out with friends. I am terrified of death yet I want him to take my hand sooner than he has planned. I lay in bed and stare at my room that my mom begs for me to clean so desperately. She begs me to come downstairs and hangout with her yet i cannot and i feel so guilty for not doing so. My dad cried once because he realized he was too hard on me. I do not eat as much as i used to a toddler could eat more than me in a day. The clothes on my back get changed when i take a shower which is a disgusting amount of days to some people. I read books wishing i was the main character i would not have to worry about getting a shitty job that i hate just so i can become another employee to this company we call the you.S. The Earth is dying and there is nothing i can do about it. I want to live life to the fullest before the end but i cannot find myself having the energy or the funds to do so. I do not see a point to life the only thing stopping me is my mom walking in on my dead body. I cannot see my life being worth it in the long run I cannot see the money my parents spend to feed and attempt to give me joy worth it. I do not get it i really do not get it i do not get why i have mascara stained cheeks right now. i do not get why two people decided to have sex one day. I do not get why I am drowning in my own misery while people have it worse. I remember in school we asked the question if a character in the book was weak or not for committing sucide. Every single person said weak. I do not see myself as a weak person and i do not think anyone who thinks about ending it is weak. I just think they want peace and they are tired. I am tired. Those few minutes of happiness a day are not worth the amount of dread i feel a week. I am young yet I am already exhausted,Depression
9141,9161,I hate everything about my life. I hate my job and nothing makes me happy anymore. I am ready to go. Just cannot find the courage. I think I am done.,Depression
9157,9177,I keep showing a happy face to everyone but in reality all I want in my life is to not have a life anymore. I do not want to kill myself I just want to die somehow painless... Does anyone else feels like that too? Will I ever stop waiting for my death to come?,Depression
9158,9178,Just as the title suggests I am feeling really numb especially today. I am not sure what is left in me. I am going to be sleeping today away Losing any hope I got left,Depression
9178,9198,it is been a rough year for everyone. I thought I was starting to bounce back a few weeks ago when I broke up with my boyfriend because it felt like a weight was lifted off my chest. I had more energy I started actually texting people back I started tackling my enormous workload that had piled up and I made plans with friends.But then 2 weeks ago I got nearly blackout drunk at a house party because the guy I started casually sleeping with brought a different girl to the party. It just made me feel so worthless and shit so I drank way too much picked a fight with a friend then walked home and made a shitty weak suicide attempt. The number of pills I swallowed was nowhere near enough to actually kill me but it was definitely enough to keep me vomiting for the next 36 hours.I came back to work after taking a sick day and was immediately overwhelmed with timesensitive critical tasks that came out of nowhere. Then Thursday night my cat got sick and spent 2 nights at the emergency vet hospital. She might have cancer but at least she is back home now and seeming better.I am at work right now staring at the list of shit I have to do that is too long too full of overdue stuff that I will never have time to do and I just cannot fucking engage. I have been in this job for 2 years now and I want some career growth but I do not have the time or energy to apply to stuff. I missed out on applying to a really great opportunity because I was puking my guts out when the deadline passed.I just feel like I will never reach that surface. Nothing will ever get better I will never grow and be more successful I will never be able to maintain relationships I will never be able to lead a good life.I just want to fucking die but I cannot seem to figure out a good suicide method. I feel like I keep trying to swim up to the surface but my legs are caught in seaweed,Depression
9216,9236,Before I explain why I am about to end my life I want to clarify that I am not advocating for suicide and if I could help it I would ensure that no one has suicidal feelings. But I am not in control. That said I just want to get this post out there as one final affirmation of my existence. Now as for why I am going to commit suicide there are two reasons My social ineptitude and my fear of human depravity. I will first talk about my social ineptitude and then I will delve deeper in the depravity of human kind and why it has fed my depression.I have been an outsider my whole life. While I did have a close friend group I never felt like I clicked with any of them on a personal level. Regardless of how much I tried I always felt different from other people and not in a good way. If others were to describe me they would probably say that I was weird or odd but not in any particular way. I am not sure how to explain it but I have felt like there is some part of me that is fundamentally different from the rest of humanity. In some ways I feel subhuman and that prevents me from actually forming meaningful connections with others. Speaking of meaningful connections despite being in my midtwenties I have been single for my whole life. I have not even held hands with a girl before. Yeah I know you are probably laughing at me right now but it is true. I have been rejected more times than I can count and honestly I try to tell myself that I have gotten used to it but really it is weighed down on me for so damn long. The only people who have been there for me are my family members but as fucked up as it sounds not even they are enough to keep me from feeling unbelievably lonely. I feel like if I cannot interact properly with others I cannot function as an adult in society and if I cannot function in society then I might as well clock out. Additionally I have been incredibly insecure about my mental and physical abilities both of which I feel like I sorely lack. This has also created a social impediment between myself and others as it feeds my inferiority complex. As for the second reason why I am going to kill myself most people are depraved. Plain and simple. I have been a true crime junkie for a while and hell has it taken its toll on my mental health. I cannot go outside without worrying that someone is going to shoot stab or kidnap me. You might be thinking that mass murderers and violent criminals make up a small percentage of the overall population and while true I believe that most humans are inherently violent. Humans are just as willing to excuse violence as we are willing to condemn it. do not believe me? Look at any video on Youtube with the title Homeowner shoots robbers in home invasion or something like that then go to the comments. I will guarantee you that most of the people in the comments section will rejoice and applaud the home owner for either gravely injuring or killing the criminals. Now I understand the appeal for selfdefense do not get me wrong. I do believe that in certain scenarios selfdefense is necessary but I do not believe that the injury or loss of a human life should be celebrated regardless of the person. The fact that this opinion is unpopular terrifies me. It seems to me that people inherently have a violent side. This violent side is also brought out when you add personal property into the equation. I remember a few years ago I read a news article detailing an incident where a store owner killed some guy who tried to steal a pack of candy from a convenience store. The website allowed for people to comment below the article and surprise surprise people applauded the store owner and praised him for killing some person who tried to steal a bag of gummies or some shit. I am still baffled that people think that ending a living soul for some candy was a fair transaction. This has further pushed me away from human interaction as I feel like I cannot trust anyone anymore. Which raises the question why am I writing this suicide note on a forum for the purpose of being read by others? Well I do not distrust all of humanity and I believe that this subreddit may have likeminded and kind people who will just let me say my piece before I die. In short I am going to kill myself because I have experienced extreme social isolation and I have developed a general mistrust of human kind. I believe if humanity works on its ability to empathize with others and to feel compassion then we will all be better off. Even though I do not know you I wish you a good day and a good life. do not live your life in constant isolation or in fear of others. do not live life like me. If you do you will regret it. My Virtual Suicide Letter and the reasons why I am going to die,Depression
9218,9238,I have left everyone and isolated myself in my room. I cannot feel satisfied or even excited about anything I simply do not care anymore. I do not want to get help because I do not think it will work I feel miserable and hopeless. I do not see myself living,Depression
9221,9241,Now I am 15 and have felt this way for 2 years I have lost pleasure and interest in basically everything. nothing excites me or feels worthy anymore I do things because I have to it is really weird and in past month it got worse I started drinking very little water my goal of the day is to get drunk my appetite is literally non existent and I cannot sleep without my phone I have a group of 5 friends plus 3 other I usually go out with but I sometimes hang out with other groups at a bar and still feel like I have no friends.Now in my country highschools are very important and I got into the best one I do not know how will I have energy to study I hope when I meet new people there it gets better for now could medicine help or I would just have to talk with a therapist Am I depressed or just bored,Depression
9230,9250,I do not want to try anymore. there is no place on this earth where I want to exist and I really wish my last asthma attack just took me out because everything has felt pointless since then. I am tired,Depression
9243,9263,I feel so misunderstood by my family like they judge me constantly think negative things about me but are holding back and telling me how to live and watching how I do claiming to love me as a family but not socializing with me not anything.I do not have any friends left.Whenever I interact with people now I tend to overshare when they actually ask how I am and actually want to know. And obviously this drives people away. So am I supposed to just keep all this to myself?I have tried those hotlines good Samaritan emails they do not help... I always feel talked down to or like they do not actually care or I am holding them up and it just does not help.I am at the end of my rope and am thinking of numbing myself out with anti depressants and anti anxieties now to just be able to stay alive and not be a bother to anyone. I do not fit in with my family and have no friends where do I go for support?,Depression
9255,9275,Are there any psychiatrists worth a damn in San Diego? Looking for second opinion in San Diego,Depression
9271,9291,I hate my life I feel no good emotions just painpain and more pain. My life is just endless suffering every single day. it is not fair I have no reason to stay alive,Depression
9282,9302,I am back at my shitty job I hate. kind of making me depressed but I need it. Back to work,Depression
9310,9330,What do you do when someone says this to you? I have no words My bf says to me stop being so depressed,Depression
9335,9355,Today i finally smiled and got happy but not because all my problems are fixed they are literally the same as they were yesterday. I got happy because i finally found the motivation to fix them. I am not crying because i have never been loved have family problems get bullied have 100s of assignments pending and no one likes me but I am smiling because i am at least trying to fight back and fix everything. I finally tried putting some effort in myself and looking at everything positively. Maybe this is all because i got high today but at least i felt some happiness. I finally felt happy after a long time and found some motivation to fix everything,Depression
9345,9365,I am sad but cannot feelthe sensation enough to cry I am hopeless and apathetic and just want to lay in bed i cannot have enough thoughts to socialise i do not have any sense of self do not know what religion i am. its like I am feeling all the sensations of depression but in half measures like i cannot just let goand feel it. What is this ? is it just apathy? What is happening ?,Depression
9346,9366,Hi everyone first time poster!Maybe this is a post for some commiseration but does anyone feel awesome interesting cool and not boring for long stretches and people always see you as that but then one day you start overthinking things and the complete opposite feelings occur? it is especially worse when you clearly are in the wrong mindset and low selfworth just consumes you and no one even close people detect that? It feels like there is an asshole version of yourself inside your brain that constantly deflects all positive thoughts about you and intercepts it all. I am doing CBT and seeing a therapist every week but I hate how these feelings rush over you and consume all of the progress you have made. I met this really cool girl 2 weeks ago and we have been having such a vibrant interesting conversation and we have so much in common and looking forward to do things together. However yesterday I smoke some weed with some friends who I actually am trying to ween away from due to their different values toxic men etc. and then all of a sudden I am having these feelings of not being good enough or cool enough for this dope girl I met. I am a man by the way and I find toxic masculinity to be something I really do not want to be a part of but I feel I am surrounded by men like that in my life. I am always looking at articles and posts about traits that are uncharismatic or make someone boring and I objectively do not feel like any of those characteristics define me but it still sucks that for every three giant leaps you take in confidence it takes one day to have it crash down. My little brother yesterday told me I am extremely confident and have been all of my life and my coworkers always know I have a fun personality. How does one remind themselves that they are as cool and awesome as everyone around them? Every time I feel like I am on a stretch of happiness one day will take me right back into feelings of low self worth,Depression
9370,9390,Just keep dreaming and never have to respond to anything... no need to eat drink and make money to live. At the end of my dream let ne just die inside it and that will be the end.Its ridiculous how difficult life is and we are all meant to suck it up it will be nice if time froze in the night and I could just sleep forever,Depression
9399,9419,If depression was a colour it would not be grey It would be beige. Nothing can satisfy my appetiteNothing can entertain meNothing will do.I am beigeThe world is not coloursIt's a blur of hues of beige. Everything is just Dull.,Depression
9443,9463,Nothing to feel sad about. No great crisis to pity me for. Being awake is just too hard. I wish I were dead. Living is too much work,Depression
9446,9466,I do not feel anything. My doctor bumped me up to 20mg of Trintellix. I am working but cannot focus. I walk 80 minutes a day and does not help. I have been on multiple antidepressants 45? and they just make me more sad.What should I do? I am so sad. I am Really Depressed,Depression
9448,9468,Lately I am very depressed treated with medicines and psychiatrist and psychologist but I am tired of feel distressed all the time. I am on a lack of motivations in life. Could you please tell me what do you live for? God family be happy money everything counts. I am not here to judge. I am here asking for help bc i do not know anymore how to be happy and I used to be the most excited person with life. Now all i want is sleep one day and no wake up again. So please just help me showing what do your life so special and maybe you could be an inspiration for me. Thank you a lot. I need some help with your opinion please,Depression
9462,9482,I have tried really hard to stick it out and be positive. But I feel like the universe has given up on me. And it never felt like there was anyone for me anyways. So maybe all of this is a sign that this is it. I do not need to keep fighting and holding on any longer. I can finally rest and be at peace. I do not need to swim against the current. Just let it take me wherever as long as I do not have to feel again.I am so tired. I do not need to keep going. I am broken and I want to say goodbye to anyone who will listen,Depression
9505,9525,My parents expect nothing less than a perfect ubermensch of a son out of me. They want me to make straight A's ace college graduate with a prestigious degree and then get some highpaying job to make big bucks. Part of it is because they never did quite reach those levels of wealth. But the rest is just them having vastly overblown expectations.I cannot handle it anymore. I do not have any marketable skills. I am an asocial introvert with one friend who does not go to college. I have pretty much given up. I do not have any drive motivation or anything now. I cannot even enjoy the things I used to love like animewatchingreadinggamingwhatever. Anything that requires more effort than browsing the internet in a mindless haze is excruciatingly draining on my mind. The only time I ever experience what can even be slightly described as happiness is when I masturbate something I do 35 times a day because...what the fuck else can I do?It does not hurt. I wish it hurt. Pain is a feeling. You can focus on pain. What I feel is a dull ache like part of myself is missing.I have realized that I will never live up to my parent's expectations. But they refuse to see it. I wish they would just accept that I am a failure. Instead they just push me and push me even though it is useless.Fuck everything. My parents' expectations are IMPOSSIBLY Unrealistic!!!,Depression
9506,9526,I was diagnosed with MDD about 2 years ago. Since then I have been working with my psychiatrist to find a medication that works for me. This past semester I hit a different kind of low. This rock bottom state made me miss a lot of classes. I am an engineering student and even missing one class can put anyone very behind. I explained my situation to my professor and she suggested I medically withdraw from the semester. After talking with my psychiatrist and new found psychologist I decided that withdrawal was the best choice for me. The process to medically withdraw is long and difficult because mental illness can be seen as a chronic illness. The board approved my request to withdraw. This is good news. Now I am in the process of filling out a tuition refund appeal. I have to write a personal statement about my situation. This refund is worth 9000. Also I can only submit this repeal once so I want to get things right. I am having a hard time putting words together to accurately depict my dip to put it lightly in depression. Has anyone else medically withdraw from school and been through tuition refund appeal? I had to medically withdraw from school because of my dip in depression.,Depression
9516,9536,I always wonder why am I so depressed? Why do I hate myself so much? Who do I always feel like I need to please others because my feelings do not matter?I grew up in a religious community. I think I relived some part of this in my dream last night. All I remember is conformity. The fear of embarrassing myself for being different the fear of getting scolded by my parents for embarrassing them. My feelings never matter in that situation. I do not know what it is like to be worthy of love and compassion because I never receive such unconditional love. I always have to be something else that I am not to avoid shame and punishment. No wonder I have such a low self worth no bloody wonder that I am suicidal. Woken up by realities from the past,Depression
9519,9539,Over the last 4 days I have gotten around 34 hours of sleep which is really annoying because I am tired all do so I cannot do anything but I am not tired enough to sleep How to sleep well?,Depression
9541,9561,17f it is the 4th week of my summer vacation and i litterllay did not leave my house. Life is so depressing when you got no rl friends. I honestly think I am cursed or some shit. I have been so unlucky all my life So fucking lonely ,Depression
9557,9577,All I do all day is sit at my pc not because I like it but because I do not have the energy to do anything else. I want it to stop I need it to stop. If therapy and medication will not make it stop I will. I cannot anymore,Depression
9560,9580,this is more of a question than anything.often times once I find things going well in life I sit down and remember where I was months ago times where I have been severely depressed and for some reason miss it. its an awful feelings once you are experiencing it but for some reason I get this weird attachment to the feeling. Ill be happy and growing as a person but then get the urge to just selfsabotage and send myself back to the hopeless place I once was in before. I feel like since I have viewed myself as someone who is mentally ill and depressed ever since elementary school its almost become an ingrained part of who I am as a person so leaving that state feels weird...? does anyone relate to this ? I am not sure if the way I worded it quite captured the feeling depression relapse,Depression
9631,9651,i am supposed to be doing better but thoughts of ending my life still plague my everyday existence. i truly believe that my death would relieve so many people of burden and immense potential pain. how do i stop imagining this escape and stop feeling this way? how do you deal with suicidal ideations?,Depression
9645,9665,I used to have this group of friends I used to talk and play with for almost every single day in 3 years. One of them 8 actually... For 8 years I thought of him as my best friend... But then later he just really demonstrated how much he really does not care about me or anyone else in that group and left and we will... The rest of the group did not last long.it is been almost a year since...I was already depressed at the time but idk... This constant feeling of loneliness? Not having any actual friends? I have tried making connections with people I sometimes meet online in games but even when I tried talking to create a connection it just never really happens... They either just do not care or will not even remember me the next day or just ghost me anyway. I feel like at my age for someone like me at least I will not be able to find that connection with anyone ever again... I feel like I will not ever find anyone I can ever trust again... Not after being betrayed multiple times by so many people including the only friend I had since I was a kid... IDK at least a couple years ago I had friends? Now I feel like I have nothing,Depression
9650,9670,After years and years of people's bullshit I have just became a bitter and closed off person compared to when I was a kid. Constant bullying constantly being ignored or belittled constantly being seen as not important stuff like this make me really despise everyone I meet. Usually people say I am grumpy or I have anger issues. They usually say I need to be a happier person and be nice to others. Well to them MASSIVE FUCK YOU . I am tired of constantly being the lighting rod of being looked down up and seen as a bad person when I am reality all I get is nothing but negative comments like racist or sexist slurs towards me or not supporting a belief or having doubts on an opinion. Yet they expect me to roll with the punches and shut up. I should give happiness to others when all I get is mental abuse and insults. that is why I despise happiness. I cannot bare to see someone happy because it reminds me of how selfish people can be. Even people who accomplished something makes me feel like shit because it feels like they are flexing the accomplishment when I am miles from them. Yet they expect me to cheer on the sidelines. It saddens me alot to see people in relationships or get opportunities while it feels like my life is on fucking repeat by eating and shitting. And if anything goes wrong it is always my fucking fault. Dog hurt there paw? My fault. someone is tire gets flat my fault. Someone is about to be robbed? Well guess who is fucking fault it is. I do not even need to be involved and somehow everyone loves to put the blame on me. All these traits that people reflected onto me just make me wish for suicide sometimes. But I am too much of a pussy to do that. Instead I just reside to my own thoughts and being my own parent and comfort myself that others failed to show. that is why I hate being happy and that is why I refuse to give happiness to others when over the years all I got was hate and bullshit and disloyalty. I hate being happy and I despise giving happiness to others,Depression
9682,9702,I do not know when it will be. Maybe at the end of the year maybe in ten years. All I know is that I am worthless to everyone and I am worthless to myself. I cannot keep this charade going forever. I do not plan on it any time soon but I know that is the way it will end. I hate myself. I have even thought I want to have a disease take me already but I am actually terrified of dying. I just want to be loved. that is all I want now. I have loved deeply and I have been shown I do not mean anything to everyone I have met. I just want people to care and love me the way i love people. I do not love myself anymore. I do not even want to. I am such a fucking loser. Despite all the shit I think about myself I know I am kind hearted person. I care for people. I just want people to care but I am not worth anyone's time. Despite all my efforts I am unlovable. I have accepted that one day I will just kill myself,Depression
9702,9722,For starters I am a skinny female with barely any curves narrow hips small boobs thigh gap small butt and just nothing exciting to look at. Yea my face is fine but you would be surprised how much a persons body is important. I tried putting on weight but its very difficult. VERY difficult. I just want to be accepted. It hurts so bad knowing most men only prefer curvy women which i totally understand i wish I could have their bodies. I am really praying my metabolism slows I just went to be a normal weight. Even to gain a simple pound Id have to eat 3500 calories and even that is a lot of good everyday. At least for meI truly think my body is cursed My body makes me harm myself,Depression
9708,9728,I have been feeling down from a long time now and the situation is getting overwhelming for me. Hence if you guys know of any platforms on reddit or elsewhere where I can talk anonymously and openly to some professional please list them out.TYIA! Request for platforms to express yourself openly to professionals,Depression
9713,9733,No really? Why have we have a species survived this long? I do not get how people can just live like this without killing themselves. I feel like my family therapist etc. think I am crazy every time I bring it up.I do not want to have a job and I do not see why everyone collectively agreed that wasting your entire week doing mind numbing bullshit that you hate was any way to live. I ended up quitting my last job after a few days. Just walked out on my lunch and never came back because I could not stop myself from crying. I get exhausted so easily and cannot really do much for more than a few hours without feeling like I am going to pass out and it is so frustrating. I was taking caffeine pills to keep me awake at work but they did not do shit. Maybe it is a medical thing or because I am autistic or maybe I am just fucking lazy. I dunno but whatever it is it made me sleep for 16 hours straight after returning from my first shift. I tried to kill myself the night after my second one. I kind of wish I actually wanted to die. I used to when I was younger but I did not really have any means of doing it. Eventually I taught myself to find things worth sticking around for no matter how small they are. But it backfired because I feel like I have no choice but to kill myself because I was born into a world I am not cut out for. Now the things that previously were keeping me here are just things I have no choice but to leave behind and it hurts more than if there was just nothing. Does that make sense? No? let us move onI am stuck relying on my parents for the time being which I hate because I know they just see me as a leech. They try to sugarcoat it but it is obvious that my dad resents me and I am just waiting for the point where he cuts me off financially because I know it is inevitable especially due to the fact that I am trans and closeted and they are both farright wackjobs who are a few Facebook links away from thinking the Earth is flat.So having any long term goals or aspirations seems really pointless knowing everything can all get sucked out from underneath me the instant they find out.Ok I am tired of typing now. going to go pass out. what is the point?,Depression
9737,9757,I have been feeling pretty weird and detached. My boyfriend and I just got through a series of arguments we both apologized to each other but I still have a hard time being close with him because of my own internal issues. it is hard for me to feel close to anyone right now. Stressful events always send me into a dissociated state it just depends how hard. Recently on top of this I was physically assaulted by a drunk guy. did not even know it was coming I think that was the most jarring part about it. He was another resident of the house I am currently living at and pretty much harrassed me passive aggressively from the moment I moved in. My weight has dropped so low because my appetite is gone from stress. I am approaching under a hundred its very bad but I just cannot make myself eat. I have such an intense sense of dread that it makes me feel like I am going to die soon. Not even suicidal just that I am at the end of my life if that makes sense. I get weird panic attacks where I am inconsolable one second and then I pop back pretty much normal the next. Chores overwhelm me much faster I have to fight myself to stay out of bed and even then I can only accomplish half of what I wanted to do. I feel very isolated and alone.Hopefully this will all pass soon I am already so tired. Vent dump,Depression
9740,9760,The Earth is fucked. Climate change is just going to get worse and at this point I cannot do anything about it. The corporations and billionaires are just going to keep exploiting and raping the world of all of its treasures and natural beauties. I do not want to live in a world that is on its death bed. what is the point of going to college right now when I am not going to get a good job anyways. I may as well drop out and get a shit job because that is what Ill end up with no matter what. would not it be better if I just killed myself and rid the world of one less wasteful person? Population is an issue anyways. I do not want to work my entire life never being able to retire. I fucking hate that I am addicted to my phone because its one of the only things I can occupy myself with without cutting myself to shreds. I became an adult last year and all I wish I could do is either die or go back to the ignorance and bliss of childhood. I want to be a happy idiot instead of a sad one. All that would make me happy is for me to live in the woods away from all people until I starve. I used to want to study film in school and now that I am all I want to do is quit. There is no money in making films when you have no talent or skill. I made the deans list after torturing myself this year as a freshman and instead of feeling any accomplishment I just feel like I have to make it again this year or Ill just quit school all together. It does not even mean much because I am a fucking film student. I am wasting my time with a major that is a scam. The only issue is that there is nothing else in the world that I would study. I am stuck. I am not talented and I do not even know if I enjoy film so now I am just going to be stuck with a major that will not give me and chance of success in life.I am so done with this bullshit world but Id be lying if I were to say that I was going to kill myself. I do not even have the balls for that. I think about it every day but I am not brave enough to do it. I may even join the military and hope that I can die. Everything is fucked,Depression
9747,9767,I am just fat amp ugly amp suicidal. i am a pos.for example I am 16 amp my bf is 23 i know its wrong but i continue to enable the relationship.i am like fat yeah I am working on it but how did i get so fat am i really that lazy of a pos. I am terrible to everyone i know because I am so fucking sad amp the sadness just turns to anger. idk what the point of this post is. I am just really tired yknow. i see pictures of myself and i wish i was never born. i wish i could starve myself till i am nothing. I am just a terrible person. I am just worthless,Depression
9780,9800,I cannot make money with any of my talents I am done working hard for nothing why did God gave me useless talent,Depression
9793,9813,how do you all seeking here not sure what for... 27yoMI have been having difficulties with my mental health for some time now but I feel it is reaching new depths I am now more happy to spend multiple days in bed comfortable and bored than out of bed attempting to progress in any sense. I suppose it is far more comfortable to be low than it is to be perpetually anxious.I feel like I have read so much of the selfhelp literature out there so it is obvious to me what must be done to pull myself out of this slump ie take responsibility and be accountable for yourself and your movements recognise that suffering is a part of life and can be a useful tool be aware of the things you are feeding yourself both physically and spiritually maybe create some sort of goals in a written format that you can regularly go over to keep you motivated and help you manifest learn to love exercise stretching and breathing possibly explore some creative endeavours be kind to yourself etc. the list goes on. Over the past 6 years I have sporadically tried to form healthy habits based off of the latter values and techniques thus attempting to take responsibility for my own happiness however with each consequential failure the more hopeless I am becoming it has gotten to the point where I am doing the bare minimum just to pay for rent leaving me financially exhausted with little room andor energy for healthy activity.I have also sought help for GP's and got in touch with a couple of psychologists GP's have given me medicinal options which have either proven to be unsuccessful for me in the past or risk the danger of becoming heavily addicted for example to benzo's I have a very addictive personality and have had ongoing issues with substance abuse namely alcohol and marijuana. I have found therapy so far firstly to be difficult to attain and secondly more homeworky mood journals document sharing technique applications etc. than is useful for me this is my own fault for not properly following their advice but it just has not been resonating with me.I feel like I have a lot to offer but am having difficulties finding where I may apply myself. I do not care for money to the point where it is reckless but I would like to find a vocation where I am fulfilled. Because I have no certifications or qualifications the roles that I am able to work are generally hospitality based physical labour or just general shit kicking this does not cut it for me and I find the little work I am performing I am performing utterly miserably spending most of the time in my head cursing myself. I cannot sustain a lifestyle like this I am in desperate need of money but more desperate need of fulfilment. I am so lazy but I am exhausted. I suppose I am looking for any thoughts out there even may they be alternative and outside of the box. I am aware that this is not an isolated issue so I suppose it is important for me to find insight in community.Be this a very broad explanation it is the best I can surmise of my emotional state for now. Whether my problems lays in being unable to accept my mediocrity pure laziness or something deeper.. I am asking for your insight please oh kind people of reddit. Alternative options?,Depression
9826,9846,This is not living let alone life. I am in constant pain every single fucking day. I even tried to do something fun tonight by myself only to end up having a sciatic episode and now I can barely walk yet once again without being in pain. I have been to the chiropractor several times and I thought after a year of going I would be fine until this shit happens yet again. I am so fucking tired of trying to make something of myself and yet people not watching my content or even cheering me the fuck on at all. I have been writing and making content for fucking almost 10 years and people do not give a shit. I do not have really any friends that give a damn all that much cept one that I barely see. I am so tired of people not giving a fuck about my or making zero effort to be in my life. After losing my mom at 14 being lied to about being a father for a few years being physically abused losing basically the rest of my family on top of every thing else I am done man. I cannot take this shit anymore. I am tired of fake ass people that only want something from me because I get tons of free shit. I am so damn tired of people only caring when it benefits them. I am tired of being fucking trolled online by people and even some people on here that stalk me and just downvote my shit. I am tired of having mental illness and barely anyone giving a shit. do not fucking come to my funeral when I am dead and pretend like I cared. do not cry at my lifeless body with your fake ass I wish I did this or that bullshit. Fucking love me now while I am alive and not wait till I am gone forever. I am so damn tired of this thing called life,Depression
9830,9850,My psychologist lie to me during rehab and told my these pills will not make me gain wait I went from 140 to 265 took me five years to get to 188185 my body was so messed up on anti depressants. Now I have gain what ITold her countless times and she said it would not yet she gave me a pill that has the most weight gain. Like why lie and make me feel more shitty than I already feel when it comes to my body . Feeling some and insecure,Depression
9863,9883,I think this is pretty tame compared to some of the other things on this but just to vent and hopefully get a little bit of advice.Recently forced out of a job was told I was worthless and disgusting even though I threw everything I had at the place. I have lost motivation to work out do my hobbies and spent sometime crying to myself. Wondering if I have let people down or just myself. I am slightly drunk right now but I am just wonderingWhat do you guys to do get back to normal? What helps you get back to normal,Depression
9872,9892,First off I was in there with a guy who stayed 3 extra days because the psych forgot to give him his heart meds and switched him to Seroquel to see if his dizziness would go away. The dizziness was from her accidentally forgetting to give him his meds. That should be enough to tell you how neglectful these places are.When I was 18 I called the hotline. I said I did not want to hurt myself but needed hell. A cop knocked on my door while I was in the bathroom and took me to an ambulance 250 fee and then to the hospital got a bill that hopefully was covered by insurance and spent 24 hours on a gurney before they decided I was not a danger to myself or others and let me go. The day after my 22nd July 2nd I was on a multiday alcohol bender and attempted pills. Cops showed up and I was not compliant kept telling them to leave me alone and they kept questioning me and standing there. Apparently they were afraid of me ODing but did not bring in an EMT. Eventually they put me in handcuffs without even saying you have to come with us or we will put you in handcuffs. They also came in through the side door and unlocked front garage door which I am pretty sure is illegal. Outside I remained compliant but kept asking why I was in handcuffs. The guy cop then frisked me and touched my penis twice and after he did that I said you just touched my dick again and then he put his finger up my ass. I am serious. He degraded me in front of my entire neighborhood in broad daylight. 0 reason to. Then they put me in the backseat of a squad car and I kept asking why I was in a car in handcuffs and kept repeating I am not going to harm anyone and they said because you told us to fuck off like 20 times and we are doing what is your best interest. Riiight not rushing me to the hospital...? I think I might have been illegally detained because I did not commit a crime or make any threatening gestures and the sodomization was 100 illegal.Eventually they decided maybe the kid overdosing needs medical help so they had me get in the EMT and they strapped me to a gurney. I have no idea why they did this because I was not fighting at all or acting like I was a danger. I kept asking and they would not give me an answer. Eventually I made it to the hospital. I had my blood drawn a total of five times. I waited in the ER for 5ish hours and then got sent up to the floor for people that attempt and act out and whatnot and it was AWFUL. Close second to jail I assume. One room with nothing to do and nothing in it shit food a hallway leading to two TVs and a group room where you spend 2 hours a day max. No counselors social workers are there but rarely see you saw mine on the 5th day was supposed to be every day and a psychiatrist sees you every morning for only 510 mins.I told them that I was a prescribed Xanax addict over and over and over again and they would not give me my prescription to help with withdrawals. Withdrawals from Xanax and alcohol are extremely dangerous and can kill you. I had two seizures in there. They gave me Ativan after my first seizure well just let us know if you have a seizure and for the next few days none of the nurses knew what was going on or the psych. I kept telling them about my withdrawals and they said you are not going through withdrawals it is a benzodiazepine it is the same thing. I was crying I felt so defeated and that I would die in there. If you know how benzo WDs feel you know what I am talking about. Severe psychological distress and physical pain. 3 days in I lost control of my arm my back was arched and lost control of the muscles in my face. I could only whisper and this nurse laughed at me and walked away. She also told me my convulsing felt like my back and neck were about to snap was just a panic attack and I needed to relax. I had a seizure on the floor and the nurse said if you flop on the floor like that I am not going to give you any benzos.The patients were also traumatizing. It was awful. Just imagine a psych ward it is just how you think it is. Met a pedophile a violent methhead a tiny meth girl who would masturbate on the phone all day a couple fucking violence between patients and securitypolice emergency calls etc. and yelling all the time. did not sleep more than 3 hours a night after I got a new doctor because my psych forgot to see me one morning and he was more or less like what the fuck are they doing?. I want off Xanax so bad but it is so difficult to kick and I am so paranoid and anxious and this experience added a layer to my PTSD and my paranoia and anxiety are at an all time high. I am so afraid and I am even more depressed. The only good part is that I am coming up on 30 days sober. I feel like I was treated like an animal and I feel... I would usually use a lot of words but I just feel like a robot. I do not know what to do... guys be careful Guys be careful with the hotline and do not ever end up in a psych ward even voluntarily,Depression
9930,9950,So let me first start by saying this I am grateful for what I have and I know that there are people that have less than me that have nothing and have already lost their lives. And I really wish that all of that factual evidence depleted every ounce of sadness and depression and anger that I have built up in my body and soul. I am a 21yearold black girl from European dissent I have three brothers and one sister. I am blessed enough to live in a two parent household with parents that guide and watch over me very closely. At nature I try to believe that I have a very strong personality and that I am a very strong person. But in the past couple of months I have never felt more of an urge to be suicidal or because harm to myself then I have in the past two years. From 19 to 21 has been a absolute horror. I have gone through so much emotional stress I am pretty sure that I am clinically depressed I have been dealing with it on my own for a very long time now. I know my mindset is very dangerous I am such a talented and strong and smart individual I often times get disappointed with myself for wanting to end my life. But my depression and sadness is so overwhelming at times no matter what people say things never get better. Not to mention my family does not necessarily see the reasons for my distress. So fixated on my ever gleaming future they seem to forget that I have been sitting in the same spot for the past two years depressed lonely I always wondered what it would be like to have sleeping problems but I guess now I know. If this is hard now why would I want to continue life so it can get harder I train physically to try and give myself something to focus on and now that is not even enough I am being ridiculed for being too muscular I cannot find a boyfriend because I am too intimidating and lonely I have no friends well none that are genuine anyway and that upsets me because I am a genuine person and they say the remedy to all of this is time but I do not want to wait any longer. I do not think I can Last straw,Depression
9962,9982,for some context I am 19 work in a trade and experienced some dark shit when i was 11. no one in my household or work believes mental health is a big deal. while i have friends only one of them is close enough to confide in and most of them are currently on a night out i was not invited to. this is the lowest I have felt in years. I have just accidentally insulted my closest friend to the point she will not talk to me after she texted me during a slump and i snapped at her yes i apologised very sincerely. the guilt of upsetting her on top of the state i was already in has pushed me to tears for the first time in 2 years and I am not sure how ill cope without being able to vent somewhere. idk if any of this is normal and I am terrified that my mental state has deteriorated this badly recently.so thank you if you have read this even if you do not respond. cried for the first time in 2 years,Depression
9978,9998,I shower only when I wash my hair once a week. I do not go to the doctor's when I have an issue I wait it out. I cannot keep track of documentation like prescriptions uni documentation.... I constantly lose everything and have to ask if I can have it printed out again. I struggle with brushing teeth. I hate myself for it.I reschedule appointments or just do not show up. have not been to the orthodontist in like 6 months. Barely managed to take my pet to the vet. I started to neglect my pets. This is something I am terrified of. Please help if you have any advice. I cannot function anymore. Advice please?,Depression
9989,10009,I am very sad. I have been sad for a while now. I feel lonely I have no one and the one person I had is no longer there. Anybody else turned out not to care about me enough. For some reason no one cares about me. But I am not sad for that reason only I am sad and depressed and do not want life anymore.Anything that makes me happy makes me happy for few hours or minutes then i go back to feeling like shit. I am sad,Depression
10021,10041,Cymbalta is an SNRI duloxetine and I am trying to taper of from 90 to 60 finsihed and now from 60 to 30 or something and trying to switch to an SSRI again trintellix vortioxetine and so far I started to take 30mg Cymbalta and 5MG Trintellix to begin tapering .... and I feel awful for now... a very strong headache and vertigo is normal?ampx200BWhat is your experience stopping Cymbalta? without counting beads Switching from Cymbalta to nothing or Trintellix awful so far? Is it really this bad to come of off cymbalta?,Depression
10036,10056,it is been 25 weeks since my boyfriend broke up with me. I know he still likes me and I still like him. I just do not know it anymore. I thought he was the one I really wanted to marry him. I miss him so much and I absolutely need him right now but I am all alone. I have no friends and the people I do occasionally talk to straightup ignore my texts. I want him back I want to marry him. I want to dance with him I want to kiss him. I am so sad and I do not know if I can do it anymore. I honestly do not know it anymore,Depression
10105,10125,I do not want to go into a lot of detail I was wondering if maybe some of you know this feeling. Since I was a kid there was a string of deaths in my family and I have always had long periods of numbess or detachment questioning reality sometimes at night etc. I have had a death in my family recently and it is been worse than ever. People seem fakeempty and boring causing me to avoid social activities even more. The worst is when I force myself to hang out with normal people talkingcomplaining about trivial things I just want to get up and leave. Nothing brings joy or excitement because it feels off.Death and the passing of time freak me out horribly and I begin to doubt anything even exists maybe even my self is an artefact of some sort. I do not know what I like or who I am I kind of stole personality traits and interests from other people nothing feels real. Everything just freaks me out so badly that I kind of disconnect I guess. In a way I am grateful for the numbness as I fear waking up. Beyond our everyday bullshit there is a great black void that I cannot wrap my brain around. Have you ever had this feeling and how do you cope with it? Everything feels fake,Depression
10122,10142,I want to talk to someone about it but I am not diagnosed. I do not have all of the major symptoms at least not constantly OR an understandable because for having depression so I am not comfortable with telling my friends.But I am going somewhere in a month and then I will not be able to see someone about it for around 811 weeks. Should I see someone in the 4 weeks I have or is it a waste? I will not be able to go to therapy until probably the end of October at least. But I THINK I may have depression,Depression
10187,10207,I am not going to tell people when I am like this because I am always like this. I am slowly going to withdraw and then I can go and it will be okay. Idk if this is a sad or happy thing but I know that people will move on. Like maybe it will hurt. But they will move on. And I will finally be free. I am on a mission to stop being a burden,Depression
10203,10223,I do not have the energy anymore for anything. Anything. I am no longer able to work. I do not care anymore about anything. I slept in every day this week I left early I played on Reddit. I did not do anything.I am no longer able to eat. I do not want any food. it is been days since I cooked. I am starving myself to the point of dizzy spells then I eat a full red pepper on its own and go to bed. I have no appetite even when I am hungry. If someone puts food in front of me I might eat it. I am no longer brushing my teeth no longer showering regularly cannot keep my room clean barely moving. I do not care about any of this.I sleep 1214 hours a day but I am always tired. I nap several times a day.I am an artist but I have not drawn in months. I have lost my passion for it and my minds eye is blank there are no new worlds in my heart anymore. Taking antidepressants. I could go to therapy but I do not see the point and I cannot keep my appointments. In order to get better you have to care enough to try. And I do not care anymore. And I do not have anyone to care for me. So idk how to get out of this. What are you supposed to do once your Depression hits Completely Dysfunctional levels,Depression
10257,10277,My MI was getting worse and I lost my job because I had to take too many days off. Then I fell into a pit of depression for a month. I thought if I found a new job I would feel better. I got a job and after a day and a half I had to leave. I could not do it. I was a trembling sweaty mess from anxiety and my concentration was shattered. The whole day and a half I was using every trick I know to stay sane and nothing was sticking. I was totally overwhelmed. Now I do not know what I am going to do. I know society at large wants me to contribute to capitalism or die trying. But the few people who love me do not deserve to be hurt like that. I really want to kill myself and get it over with but I have tried and it is harder than it looks. I do not have a gun. But I do not have any other solution either. Burden people while living or hurt them by dying. This world is a fucked up place. depression and jobs,Depression
10265,10285,Yeah depression sucks but what if instead of talking about the shit that sucks in our lives we spoke about everything that goes right. I have been trying to take my Ws when they come rarely do and it seems to be working to an extent. Just an idea.. it can be called Verbalization. If of course it does not already exist New Thread,Depression
10319,10339,i feel like there is more than one of me. in me. how the fuck do i say this alright alright. there is the first one which is pretty much just me. the one that talks the one that thinks the one that is writing this. the main one i guess. then there is the second one. the one that tells me to shut the fuck up whenever i say something. the one that insults me every time i do something. the one that digs my fingernails into my palm whenever i annoy him. the one that hates me. he is also the one that calms me down if i get too angry. the one that just tells me to take deep breaths if I am shaking. he yells at me but if i yell at myself he will calm me down. i have literal conversations with him. with myself. with the fucking mirror. i do not know why. i do not know if it is just normal or if I am fucked in the head. i do not have multiple personality disorder probably I am almost sure i do not. i have no idea what is going on with me. i do not know what is wrong with me if anything,Depression
10394,10414,Really. I always thought this to an extent. But now the one friend I was closest to for years and I supported for years just let us me rot and could not care less how I am feeling or if I died. I am sure this friend will cry and play victim when I die. I never saw this coming and this just confirms that most people are shit. I am still in shock and I am full of hate for this person now. I know that is not serving me anything good but the last 3 years have been so fucking SHIT and I have met so many people who have fucked me over and showed me they do not care about me when I thought they did and when I did care about them. I am so done.Maybe it is fucking cheesy and pathetic but these lyrics speak so much to me nowDo I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness? Fuck people,Depression
10420,10440,Recently I have started this internship and moved to this really amazing city an opportunity I have been waiting for one and a half year but unfortunately for me I absolutely hate the work that I have to do. Ironically from a general point of view it is really not awful and while I am fully aware of it it still everyday kills me a little more. However this internship was my wayout ticket from last year which was one of the worst years of my life. we have got sent home from uni my 3rd and last study year became online and I do not think I have ever encountered so much loneliness isolation and dullness like I did during the pandemic in my life. Besides work and work again though on my 2 days off I either read or stay in my hotel room. Have got absolutely no one to do anything with. Go out hangout eat or explore the city and doing all these things by myself just makes me feel even more alone than I am so it seems like that is it. that is where my life stops. And I am stuck. Because even though I feel like I cannot stay here any much longer I know for sure I can not go back home. Because as little as I have here I literally do not have anything back home. No friends no group no social life absolutely nothing. And that makes me feel like I am completely missing out on life at 23 when I should be living my best years gain all these experiences and feel young I feel old and tired and absolutely broken inside. I just can not fathom why seemingly I can not have a more active life. what is painful is that I am someone to who being active and friendships count a lot and yet no matter what I try or where I end up it is always the same pathetic record me being so on my own and never having friends ever since I have graduated highschool. I honestly just do not know what to do anymore. Where to go or what to follow but this can not be it. it is exhausting feeling and living this way. Doing and having nothing and holding back crying almost every day. A huge part of why I am so unhappy that is probably even more excruciating is the fact that I am not able to do what I am really passionate about professionally. The school I ended up going to was a plan B. I have chosen it after already dropping out of another one and deep down even though I was hopeful I have knew I would probably end up here. that is the thing about plan B's is not it? I think that is exactly the reason why I am so lost and cannot seem to find my place in this world. I have tried so many different things and they all were such a clear reminder that I know I am on the wrong path and that my biggest issue starts from there. I have grown up with an immense love and fascination for film and I do not think there is anything that I would want to do more than filmmaking. Unfortunately in my homecountry there is no school or even an industry for that and abroad I just simply can not afford to study. it is literally the only thing I know in my bones I would be good at. it is hard to explain but I just feel it. What I am having a hard time with is understanding why is that my socalled professional call if that is literally the only thing I would want to do but cannot. It consumes me how much I would want to at least be able to try to do something about it but cannot. And accepting whatever's left instead just kills me and clearly even though I have tried and am still trying even these days is not a healthy option. Lastly I just want to quickly mention that for some reason even though I love reading books make me feel even worse. I have been reading a lot of YA and they all depict a reality I would like to find myself in. All the laughs all the friends all the parties and crushes are exactly the elements I am missing and have always been missing from my life. And this is exactly why I feel like I do not belong. I feel things differently. Maybe I just feel more. People nowadays are so shallow and to me valuing things being genuine and having genuine connections is still so important. I have got so much life in me and things I would want to do places I would want to visit but here I am. Maybe I am just delusional maybe I have highfunctioning depression I have been thinking about therapy a lot but I just know that it is not going to magically give me neither friends nor the career and life I would like to have. I just feel like I am not right for this world I honestly do and even though I am not suicidal and I would never do anything to harm myself death seems like such an easy way out. As if tomorrow I would be told I have a terminal disease it would give me a twisted purpose because for the first time in my life I would know where everything is headed to. This one and a half year for some reason I can not begin to tell you how much I have thought of that. Anyhow thank you a lot for taking time to read this if you got to this point any advice is much appreciated! I think I am never actually going to have a life or find my place in this world,Depression
10445,10465,hey does anyone want to talk? just to get my thoughts out i have absolutely no one to talk to I 16F am having a depression relpase,Depression
10452,10472,I am not looking for peoples to wish me an happy birthday I want to say that sometimes life is worth living i wanted to end it all at 20 but here iam it takes time before something bright happen but it will eventually happen I wish everybody the best and if you need to talk I am here for you take care guys I made it to 21 yo,Depression
10468,10488,I grew up in a very abusive household and my friends also hPpened to be physically and emotionally abusive narcissists. So when i was 15 my father saw i had a few cuts on my arms and his response was to yell wtf is that. I replied with stress. he then gets right into my face... STRESSED I am THE ONE that is STRESSED. I WORK ALL DAY I HAVE 3 DIFFERENT BUISNESSES I DEAL WITH. IF YOU EVER DO THAT AGAIN you will FUCKEN SEE WHAT HAPPENS.Since i was a child he is been training me everyday since i was a kid id go to wwork with him untill i started school. Then it was jist the summmers. And then it was weekends and summers by the time i was 12. I jad become severely overweight and only haad 2 physically and emotionally abusive friends. By the time i was 14 i was essentially running one of the buisnesses myself. Yet he acts like i have all this fucken free time to do everything he needs when I am trying to have my own life. He goes you can do whatever you want but then also forces me to work under him and underpays me when he finally made me become an employee since we were lacking manpower at the time. Anything I have ever said was ignored constantly belittling. All i feel is emptiness at this point. And finally realizing that my friend was a fucking sociopathic rapist. I mean i always new he was a bad person but i never fully understood. I have a very child like bubbly personality ehich was just ripe for abuse i guess. I may have bpd i need to see a therapist but i really just want to give up on life. Idk. I am 24 now. I finally kicked out the toxic ppl in my life after starting to find my voice but I am still stuck with my father because of work and while it seems like hes trying. It also seems fake whenever there is an actual problem he reverts back. The amount of gaslighting manipulation scapegoating belittling bullying I have taken. I have so many stupid storys like being ditched hit picked on played with by friends and family. And all i did was take it because that is all I have ever done. And i was yelled at otherwise. For fuxks sake I have been ditched at a piehole pizza because i had the keys and my friend had the food i went to unlock my door he saw and rushed at my with his fist in the air ready to punch me i flinched and tossed the keys over his head. It fell and broke this plastic compass his father got him. His mom and dad divorced. because from what he told me he was an alcoholic. But they still see eachother alot. And seem to have a good relationship. Idk. My friends never really told me anything about their lives. But it broke and he freaked out got in the car and drove off. I yelled for my cigarettes My fathers response to the cuts on my arm was to threaten me,Depression
10506,10526,My life sucks and I cannot imagine it changing for the better. I hate where I live I do not feel welcome here. My family look at me like I am a burden they need to get rid of. I do not know what I am doing with my life I do not have money and I do not know what I am doing with work and school. I feel like I am a waste of space who is never going to accomplish anything. I just want things to be different I do not want to be here anymore Feeling like there is no way out,Depression
10547,10567,I realized that the reason I procrastinate doing certain things is because in a way I do not think the event is real. Like I never tried to get scholarships for school because I guess I thought I had more time. But even with all the time in the world I just do not do it and I think that is because I am so unsure about school and if I am even meant to go. I feel like half my brain is able to acknowledge that this physical world is real but then the other half of my brain is scared and confused and is like I do not want to be here anymore I want this to end. Like when you are watching a bad movie and it makes no sense and you want fo walk out the theatre. I say scared too because this feeling is very lonely. I am a person who is alone a lot and who is independent in a lot of ways so when I am left alone like in my bedroom I just get such an odd feeling like this world is so unfamiliar to me. I live with my mom and even if I hear her talk downstairs I am just confused. Or if I am not with my dad I just feel confused. I know I keep saying confused because I do not know another way to explain it. I guess its just a feeling of loneliness and wanting to know too much about a concept life and the spirit that no one knows the answer to. I guess the best word to use would be that this world feels very dream like. And I want it to feel real not dream like. I feel unreal and it scares me,Depression
10549,10569,I know most of Reddit is not a fan of police. I do not really want to be anymore but its the only thing I know how to do. Anyway I always used to think those haunted by a mental illness were weak or over dramatic. For the most part I have had an optimistic look in life and growing up I was sheltered so I never went through anything truly traumatic. It does not make sense for me to be depressed. But hindsight is 2020. I am sad because most cops I have worked with have very little personality and have little empathy for the things every day people are experiencing. Or they did initially but daily exposure to this shitty planet numbed them to it. What I am getting at is I am not that type of person. I grew up with an over imaginative mind as my dad used to call it. I would write fictional stories skits for my siblings and make short films with dinosaur cut outs I drew. To this day I have so many aspirations outside of this career but having a wife kid house vehicles bills and mentally draining job have basically killed all my dreams of publishing a fictional book or making a fan film in my free time. Its who I really am but daily I must be something that I am not. To continue to afford things and be responsible. I am a free spirit trapped in a law officers body. And its killing me inside. Only my daughters smile after work makes it worth it. Some days I just day dream about quitting livings out of my SUV and letting go of this shallow materialistic society we endure. I Wish The because Could Be Identified,Depression
10553,10573,Why do I do the things I do.. why do people worry why do I not care enough to actually careWhy do I want to please everyone other than myselfWhy do I obsess over the pastWhy do I feel like I am going insaneWhy do I have so many people in my head..Why have not I harmed myself yetWhy do I have a pent up anger against my dead fatherWhy do I have to take a pill for my adhd to make me feel sane..Why do not I trust therapists..Why do not I ask for helpWhy do I want a relationshipWhy do I have heart pains. Why,Depression
10561,10581,hey allI have been going through a weird past few weeks of my life. one week it feels like I am on fucking cloud 9 the next like I am the worst I have ever felt. so what i decided to do was delete all my social medias and try to work on my mental health. somehow doing this has only made me feel worse. I have tried to kill myself once sort of and i know i do not want to but what i really want is just a way out. i feel unbothered by the everyday throws of life indifferent. i have no passion not for anything whereas it seems all my friends have at least one. I have tried picking up some but nothing seems to stick. i just feel lost in life and i guess for my age that is ok but i still need help. if anyone can offer any advice id greatly appreciate it. passionless sad and sleep deprived,Depression
10563,10583,I say I do not care but then why do I care if people worry? that is only reason why I have not harmed myself externally I just do not want to worry people.I have said this to many friends but if i where to die Id like to be alone so I could be dead knowing that no one knows I am gone and know one worrys. I only feel like I exist to want the companionship of a relationship.Why does it feel like everyone is watching me judging me being disappointed in me?Expressing my thoughts and feelings seem to hurt people and push them away.. so I should not express anything and keep hiding behind my fake smile? I guess I should because if not then id worry people. I do not understand myself,Depression
10591,10611,I cannot even be productive when it is my life on the line. I just want to be dead but I am too scared. I know there is nothing in this life for me and I am so over feeling bad for myself it is honestly funny. I am just too weak and worthless and alone to survive all of this bullshit. I do not know how to fix this I do not even see how fixing it would be worth it. Everyone I know is depressed and I am the only one who is too weak to handle it,Depression
10610,10630,Tw suicide mentionIm going to be honest I have been thinking about suicide lately I have been so alone lately And there are times where I feel like completely emptyAnd you might think that is just me being sadNoIts literally nothingIm not sure how to describe it as anything different its just nothingAnd sometimes I have just started crying for no real reason and I cannot stop crying I know that I am slowly losing everything because of this And I cannot tell anyone this because I know the second I do Ill be treated like some charity caseI do not want thatAll I want is to be okayIve said that in my letter to myself To at least be okayWhy cannot I be okayIts not like I fully want to feel happyOr have everything I ever wantedIs it so hard to ask God or the universe or whatever the hell is out there to be okay?If I cannot be okay can I at least feel something positive because I have not had that this past yearI just do not know what to do anymore at all and I really would like some guidance I am really empty,Depression
10634,10654,disclaimer i do not take antidepressants and i do not think ever will. i do not want to intermingle any ssri snri or others alike with my current medication adderall due to concomitant risk factors.i feel like I am in a state of inertia i want to strive far and make progress in many different fields and I am confident but i do not take the steps to further reach my goals.I am 19 years old. just 12 months ago i got my first job at petco. the experience was great i can proudly say i had a strong beneficial impact on both my peers and the people id meet on a daily basis. i was a very bubbly kid a yesman with a smiling face willingness to see each of my peers have a better day and loved to perform beyond expectations.unfortunately the store ended up losing people and those that remained turned lax. i eventually alternated from animal care and occasional stockwork to fulltime at the register alone eight hours a day. this schedule quickly turned me into a robot marred my social enjoyment and stressed me out. what made matters worse is that my boss wanted me to force customers to sign up for our rewards program i would always ask them list the positive facets and whatnot but there would always be people that just wanted to get there stuff and book it and a lot that would get angry at me. i did not force people because i did not want to look more like an advertisement drone. the stress impacted my respiration heart rate caffeine consumption and sleep. to keep from saying much more of it i disappeared early into may without notice.since i quit I have been playing the same video game overwatch yeah i know for at least 6 hours a day sometimes up to 12. i love it and i find myself most content when i play it primarily because I am really good at it. after about a month of routinely doing this i started to think about how i have even less of a life than i did when i was practically a vapid husk at petco.my room is big. adjunct bathroom and everything. extremely comfy bed relaxing striplights tranquil fan breezes... every person that has stepped foot in here has loved it. maybe its too comfy.my med stack is stupidbig. its mostly composed of nootropics and micronutrient supplements dextroamphetamine amp. salts adderall 5htp st. johns wort ashwagandha ltyrosine nacetyl cysteine sarcosine vitamins b6 b12 and d3 ginkgo biloba omega3 magnesium cl. hexahydrate topical ltheanine amp gaba calcium carbonate tumsmy diet is awful. i eat pizza pbampj and fast food. i wish i ate fish and nutrientrich foods i really do. there is just something in me that tells me i will never eat it.i got my permit when i was 16. i tried driving back then but eventually just stopped wanting to sometime before i turned 18. I am just scared to.i want to spend time with my friends and enjoy it but after an hour of doing so i often end up wanting to isolate and tackle boring statistics or learn about some ridiculous topic just to do something.i wanted to go to college for pharmacology. my knowledge on the subject broadens every day and i employ it to help people as much as i can and its worked.i used to listen to music. now i skip 80 of the tracks in my playlist. i used to feel butterflies within me when i spent time with my girlfriend but even though i love her with every last fiber of my being it does not feel the same.i have a novel presently with 50k words. i love my literary tongue and i would love to pursue it but i just do not.all i do is play that one video game and read.is anybody else amid an inertia like this? any kind of comment would make me feel good. I am not sad nor 'feel' depressed at all but I am definitely plagued with apathy and know that I am going no where in life. what am i missing?,Depression
10647,10667,So I am a week into taking Wellbutrin. About day 5 I had a few hours where I literally FELT things. Happiness my surroundings everything felt magical. And then the next day I am just irritable and anxious. The first two days were pretty awesome as well minus the odd dreams. And I notice I sleep longer than normal on wellbutrin as well so far. But yeah. Right now I am anxious. Depression is kind of worse. Abd I have the odd feeling in my right abdomen. does not hurt to touch but I can feel it flare up occasionally. Not painful. But definitely worried it is messing up my liver or something dangerous. Anyhow. I have been dealing with a pretty gnarly depression since having covid last year and I was hoping that this would help since SSRIs do not agree with me. Also I have not noticed any improvement in libido. In fact sometimes cannot even sustain an erection while taking this. Although I did wake up with a surprisingly good one last night Anyhow just seeing if anyone had any advice or similar experiences. Feeling pretty down right now Wellbutrin side effects,Depression
10648,10668,Hi I know that probably nobody is interested in listening to this but I am trying anyways because I have nothing to lose already.I am stuck on a life that seems to not get any better.I lost one of my best friends because of a bad decision that cannot be retracted I am stuck on a job which I do not see myself getting out of. And worst of all I feel that everyday I am losing who I am and I just need to get this pain out just feel a bit of enjoy on my life. I am tired of fighting for what I think is right caring for other looking for friends searching for the good for everyone even me. This has only brought on me pain and dread I cannot be the person that I wanted to be and that makes me empty. I do not feel to be a bad person I cannot ignore other people's emotions and if I am made fun of it I am being called fucking stupid for it for everyone I know maybe its that I am not made to be in this world. Sorry for being this negative on this text and for my bad english and grammar but I am so lost and with a little of bravery I am going to attemp to kill myself.Thanks for reading this if you reached to the end of this. I am on the verge of ending it all,Depression
10655,10675,Well looks like I have to wear socks again bc I am fixing to self harm why is life like this I was just coloring and I had these thoughts I am 15 why does this happen to me help me dear lord please somebody I am begging pleading help me I am done help me pls I am begging pleading even,Depression
10683,10703,27M broken up with by 25F of 4 years nearly 2 months ago. I have barely slept when I do its nightmares. She has already moved on in the first 2 weeks with men bigger and stronger than me. I feel so pathetic so helpless. I have no relief. I drive for hours and hours with no destination. I cannot focus at work I hate everyone in the same city that she is in. I cannot live without her. I do not know how to continue on. My therapist told me I need to lean into this and deal with the pain as it comes. It is unbearable I feel like I am drowning. I cannot Live Without Her,Depression
10801,10821,I can go walking but it is not going to last very long. I could read a book outside but I do not really read that much. I could just get some food and eat outside but I feel awkward about people judging me. When I do spend that time outside and I do not have much to do I end up watching others which not only makes me feel like a bit of a creep but also makes me sad to see everyone else enjoying themselves.I wish I could enjoy other things outside since I know I feel better out there but not having anything to do while outside sometimes feels worse. Spending time outside tends to make me feel better but I have nothing to do outside.,Depression
10808,10828,I tried to be strong physically and mentally. I had hope lots of it. But after years of nothing happy and good happening. Why would I keep going? Its only right for me to commit suicide. ThTs what they want the universe? God? The creator. God teases and bullys me. He let us the devil have me. So if that is what is supposed to happene why would I keep allowing myself to suffer? I had big dreams and goals I was a happy kid genuinely nice but the world has changed me. For the first time I need toe be honest with myself. I want to die. And I do not see anything happy in my future. After all the hope and let downs I have had I would be a fool to keep going and allowing the world to continue to beat me. If someone seees this I just want you to know I tried. I truly did put up a fight. But sadly as always I did not come out victorious. My family does not deserve this. I at least wanted to live for them. But we do not always get what we want and I want to go. I hate that it cameTo this but I am so sad and tired. I am at my limit and I cannot tAke it anymore. Goodbye I tried to be strong,Depression
10817,10837,Right now I am at the I cannot feel or enjoy anything anymore state. I cannot even feel love anymore. There is no relief anywhere besides sleep and drugs. I think I am nearing the end of the tracks. What are the symptoms of severeend Stage depression?,Depression
10836,10856,I just cannot take it anymore I am clearly addicted to it and reading to all those people make me feel like they all lost their minds even though I am an insane one here. Like I has been really interested in politics since I was younger and I am clearly leaning one side left if I have to say... but I just cannot get over the fact how there are people on both sides that are just nuts no one wants to hear each other out on the internet and every comment section where disagreement happens becomes an allout war where it is impossible to convince anyone to at least consider other side or just respectfully disagree no the goal is to absolutely obliterate your opponent. I understand that some opinions perhaps should be socially ostracized but it came to a level that everyone gets offended even if you try to be as balanced as possible and if you have no opinion you admit that you are not informed well enough because apparently now everyone has a PhD in every field etc. you becomes everyone is enemy and it it does not only apply to politics as an example I cannot enjoy anything oh you wanted to eat a cake? be sure someone comes and tells you how unhealthy it is oh you wanted to watch some movie? be sure someone on the internet comes and tells you that there are bad values in it or something I understand what they mean but you cannot live in a constant state of paranoia where everyone is offended by something. Everything is becoming more exclusive and every group becomes less and less inclusive. I am not saying that I am not guilty of those things but I try to comfort myself that I try to be at least a bit selfconscious.It came to this that when I readwatch anything on the internet that is not some funny innocent video my mental torment becomes impossible to bear the only thing I am constantly thinking of is smashing my head on the wall with all my might. News pleas I hope this world will end soon Comments even worse. I am just scrolling scrolling and scrolling and with every post scrolled I just loose a tiny bit of my sanity and when you magnify it by the number of scrolled posts it becomes apparent that I am completely mentally deranged.And my depression usually simply makes me unable to do anything else then scroll this god forsaken web because I do not really get satisfaction from anything and this internet stockholm syndrom makes me feel at home with this psychic torture.tldr the internet is just a toxic place that I cannot escape.I do not know if it is even a good place to post it and I will probably delete it like I usually do... but it seems like this subreddit is rather friendly and I apologize for this rant but I wanted to vent out maybe find comfort if someone feels the same... The Internet is driving me crazy,Depression
10856,10876,I have awful headaches all the time and my brain is just so scrambled I compulsively think about things and I cannot calm my brain down. I just jump from one thing to another. I have a hard time articulating words or explaining myself or thinking things through or even feeling things socially.I feel nauseous alot and completely empty I do not care about anything. I cannot commit to any job or school or even sit down and read a book. I feel very little emotional and feel like my perception feeling existence is not even based in reality anymore. I am just weird and burnt out and scrambled.Doctors tell me I have depression and ocd and have prescribed me ssris and snris but I cannot commit to taking them because I do not beleive they will work. I beleive they will make me numb and my dick not function and probably just take away some obsessive thoughts. Does this sound like depression?,Depression
10879,10899,I have not said a single word to another human in four days. In the last four weeks my only interactions all brief were with coworkers about work. I work remotely so there is no way to have any more interactions. I am so fucking lonely that its starting to fuck with my head. I am moving soon from where I live so I cannot join any clubs or anything here. I really need some support. Can anyone help me? I am lonely and depressed,Depression

10928,10948,I do not even know why I am posting this out in to a void where it will not get seen will not change anything and will not help anything. I have been having a crappy year. And that is an understatement. I feel like everyone hates me and I am so so fucking lonely. I cannot do anything right. I am a failure disappointment and a let down to my family. I ruin everything I touch or go near.I am in financial problems and cannot find a way out. My mental health has never been so bad. And there is no one I can talk to no one who will help. Everything is too much. I do not want to be here anymore but cannot leave. I wish I never existed everyone would be better off that way. I am toxic. I hate myself. I am so lost and overwhelmed,Depression
10934,10954,Everything was normal. It was better. But slowly I can feel it lurking in the corner. Just waiting for me to slip into it. Why does no one talk about how comfortable you get with being sad. Like the other emotions are so dull. Almost negllgible. Sadness anger regret these are so high on intensity. I do not know what I should do now. it is getting bad again.,Depression
10938,10958,I am a student and work parttime. I am not able to cover part of my semester fees as i could not earn much due to lockdowns. My semester fees are due next week. If i cannot cover my fees i will not be allowed to write my exams.I am feeling hopeless.I have requested my college but they said nothing can be done to help. I do not know what to do. I am dealing with depression for more than a year.My life is just falling apart.I do not think i can live with this stress and depression anymore.I do not have parents friends ot anyone to ask help or share anything.Please help me if you can.I wish i never existed.I wish this was not happening.Life is getting worse everyday. I wish this was not happening..,Depression
10939,10959,Back story how I got to where I am. I am 20F and I moved in with my boyfriend a few months ago. Everything was going great until I got depressed again. I could take care of myself properly could not get myself motivated to do anything slept in later than I should. And my bf tried to help me in a way I told him time and time again that it would not work. For some reason everytime someone in my life pushes me to do things that I am scared of or have a hard time doing I just shut down completely. I agree I was pretty terrible to live with. Some days I helped out so much around the house and other days I could not get myself to do anything at all. I also did not have a job because he would not jump start my car because he was so afraid of me crashing my car on purpose I would not do that. Flash forward to three weeks ago everything got worse we started fighting constantly. He told me I should have tried harder and he was right. He said it was killing him to see me like this. He said if I did not get myself fixed or start doing more for myself that hell kick me out. So I slowly started to do more and take care of myself. However we still fought constantly. I still could not get him to realize how I felt the way I do and could not get him to start my car. So with that being said I still could not get a job and he hated that. Flash forwarded again last night he packed up all of my things and kicked me out. The entire time telling me he felt so bad for doing this but it all my fault. Then he got moody and told me that until I get better that we can only be friends. So I was crying hysterically and could not drive myself back to my parents so he had to take me home. I had a bad panic attack to the point I could not breathe and my whole body was all locked up joint wise. Took him a bit to realized that I was not just trying to get him to let me stay and I needed help with it. He told me if I start making progress with myself that we can start seeing eachother again but I feel lost. My parents are so mad at me because I failed my relationship. They because very strict with me and are pushing me the exact way I told them it would not help. there is more but this is the just of what happened. I just need someone to listen and encourage me to do better.,Depression
10944,10964,The title pretty much speaks for itself. What should I do when I get strong suicidal urges besides talking to someone?,Depression
10988,11008,Last Sunday something happened in my friends life that made her not want to be my friend and delete all her social media I still have zero idea what happened. I called the police to do a welfare check on her because in the past this has happened with family members because and the police need to be called to help. The police check on her and call me to tell me she is fine. That was the last update.She originally blocked me on everything and then unblocked me a little while later and then deleted everything she had. I know she is in a crisis at the moment so I am not angry or annoyed with her I am just concerned. In the last she is told me she is used an app called Vent so I decided to download it to see if she is posted anything. She posted a few hours ago talking about working out and how happy she is now she is alone and does not have to impress anyone. she is happy she is alone... I never even got to meet her.I miss her My best friend vanished.,Depression

11198,11218,there is this guy on whom my bestfriend had a crush on and genuinely i did not find anything attracting in him and years went by she got new crushes and stuff and there was this day where i just remember him randomly and this was not just for hours it went on for months. He is the only thing on my mind and that is when i realized i have fallen bad for this dude and yeah we spoke and i confessed but neither he wanted to date nor me because the age difference is 4 years smth but it is been a year and i still have not moved on from him. Everytime i tryna imagine a perfect guy in the whole damn world it is only him i can think of. how tf am i supposed to move on that dream guy of mine,Depression
11201,11221,I am 19 M Its 6am and I have work soon. I cannot sleep and I have not but this is not like me. I have been up all night with the same thoughts running through my mind you should kill yourself who cares how you feel its not like you are important shut up shut the fuck up and stop being a bitch I do not know what to do anymore. Every day feels the same and nothing gets better. I have felt this way since I was in 7th grade and now its to a point where I genuinely do not think I am worth anything. I feel so broken and lost all I can do is cry and think of how terrible I am. Its every day these thoughts of hating myself run on replay in my mind. I have no emotional support from my family or friends and I cannot afford therapy. This shit hurts so bad and I cannot tell if I am actually depressed or just full of self pity. Oh my god it hurts so much and I cannot get out of this hole. I know I am better than this and can overcome it. If you met me in person you would have no idea I felt this way. This probably sounds the same as every other person who is reached out for help on Reddit but all I think about is how much better off I would be dead and its not how I want to be. Could somebody please help me see the light and how much better things could be. I feel nothing but emotional pain and always hate myself for any small thing I do. I just want to overcome this and not end up taking my own life. I really need someone right now,Depression
11241,11261,Hi there. At one point in my life not so long ago I was worried that I lacked all drive. I had no desire to do anything to improve to go forward. I thought that I was doomed to apathy.Now my issue is a little different. I wanted to have desires and I got them. Finally I have goals and hopes and dreams. But I cannot seem to pursue them. I cannot sit down and do work. I cannot focus. I cannot get the will to make even one small move towards where I want to be and in many ways this is worse than not having any drive at all. I feel like a climber who wants to hike a mountain so badly but my mind holds me back from ever taking that first step.And this is not really a motivation thing. I can tell myself a thousand times that I need to start going and I just cannot. Something is holding me back and it feels like there is a part of me missing some crucial element that would actually allow me to take part in life normally.Any advice experience or anecdotes are welcome. Thanks for reading. Dreams Without Execution,Depression
11247,11267,I am so tired . The worst part of this disease is that there is never a bottom. Everytime you think you have reached the worst level of this you unearth an entire new lower level of depression. I want to go home . that is all I keep telling myself but home is not here . Home is not here on earth . Its somewhere else . I feel like I do not belong on this planet . I hate being here so much . I have missed work a lot lately because everything seems pointless the depression is unbearable now. I want to kill myself so bad . I want to go home . No one knows how bad this shit is . No one knows how unbearable this is . All I can say these days is I want to go home. I want to go home. that is it. that is all I got left in me that is all I can tell you at this point . I hate it here.,Depression
11275,11295,So far I have been on Effexor ER and Zoloft. I have struggled with depression for nearly 10 years but am only now seeking help. I have now tried each for 8 months. Effexor helped A LOT but the side effects and withdrawal were awful. Worse than coke withdrawal. Zoloft is helpful. Does not help as much but it definitely helps and maybe a dose increase would help more. Neither of these two seem to fully help. Should this be expected? Do any antidepressants REALLY help in the way you hear about? What med has been YOUR personal savior? And what meds have you tried? I am looking for detailed descriptions of experiences on as many meds as I can based on the description of YOUR PERSONAL depression experience. I understand everyone is different but if our depression is similar then our meds can also be similar. I want to try a range if meds to find the best one for me. And I just want to understand and know some of the meds before I talk to my doctor about them. I want prior knowlege. The internet does not give this so I need to ask real people with real experience. Thank you for any reply. Experiences and recommendations?,Depression
11276,11296,i am a minor who is been struggling with symptoms for depression for over a year. i feel completely invalidated by my own feelings. even though i think I am depressed i tell myself i have no reason to be. i have a good family and were well off. i have a lot of friends but all of this and i still struggle. I am surrounded by suicide and have been for awhile now. i feel trapped. its not that my parents do not care but when they walk into my room and I am clearly upset and they ask what is wrong i tell them i do not know. because i do not know why I am crying or even why I am sad. they do not believe me so i always have to make up an excuse. recently my mom asked me if i was depressed and i feel like that was my time to ask for help but i do not want to admit that I am actually struggling with it. i told her i was just lazy. i do not have anything to tell a therapist as to why I am sad but do you think i should seek help anyway? should i seek help,Depression
11277,11297,I will preface this by saying that usually I try to take on this image of being a providerprotector solid as stone cracking jokes always happy to help respectful as can be rational and so forth. Typical manlyman type of stuff that I was raised to internalize as markers of my self worth. But man if there is anything I want in this world it is to be cared about. I want to be loved and I am sure I have someone in my life that does but if so they do not really show it... I have a bunch of surfacelevel friendships with people I cannot just text and talk to or ask to hang out. I have one friend but she is now in a relationship with a guy that I have become great friends with in recent times and out of respect for him and their relationship I try not to vent to her as much anymore like we mutually used to plus I feel like a bother. I am no softy but I wish I had someone that I could just be vulnerable around and not only be cared by but care for. I am moving in about a month anyways so it makes no sense to try and get into a relationship but the new job I am starting will make it very difficult to start a long term relationship. I wish I had a cuddle buddy if anything. Totally nonsexual uninvolved but just someone that I can turn on a movie with and snuggle up against. Maybe fall asleep. I feel totally pathetic writing that but it could not be closer to the truth. It seems that all I am really good at is getting angry being angry and feeling like an asshole when I know I am anything but. I am 99 sure the reason for this is that my dad is mostly a good guy that can get REALLY angry but only when someone is being beyond stupid or inconsiderate. I guess I rationalized this as being mad being right and if someone pisses me off out of all people it must be for a good reason. it is really just me being on a power trip for a short moment because otherwise I feel incompetent at most shit. I think I just like being mad because it gives me some sense of superiority and also because deep down I am just secretly a lonely hurt man who is tired of having to hide his emotions.I guess I will end it off on some good news. I love running. there is countless trails I run on that no one else really goes on so I just leave my phone at home or in the car and just go. I feel so free. And at the end of each one there is always a beautiful view waiting for me so I take a break and just kind of stare off and appreciate it before heading back home and enjoying my shortlived runners high. I am also pretty good at basketball and enjoy playing it. that is really the only time I am happy most days otherwise it is just constantly checking my phone to no new texts and playing video games and patiently waiting to head to bed just to not sleep. To whoever reads this thanks and I hope all is well. Thanks for letting me rant. I just need someone to hold me.,Depression
11283,11303,I have spent the past few months rowing my rickety boat down the black river and into the abyss. I have gone past anger. I have gone past tiredness. I have recently passed bitterness. Now I have arrived at arguably the most dreaded part of the journey...apathy. I enjoy nothing. I look forward to nothing. I have no hope and the little droplets of hope I do have quickly evaporate. I do not even know why I am bothering to post this because it is either going to get lost in the sea of other posts like it or it will not help me or both. I am good at nothing and I cannot even bring myself to properly attempt to try new things because I am met with such a disdain for my own existence. Every day I am either filled with hate or I am totally empty. I have nothing left to give this world and it sure as shit has nothing to give me. Every passion I thought I ever had has been ripped from me because of my apathy towards life. All desire that I have is squashed almost immediately by my complete ineptitude and I have been at the end of my rope for as long as I can remember. I do not really have a point to this I just needed to vent I guess. TLDR I feel like I am an artist but I am trapped by my piece of shit brain and talentless body. I am nobody and I am nothing. I serve no purpose and nothing serves me. I am empty. I have surpassed bitterness and I am now at the purest form of apathy,Depression
11287,11307,I have recently noticed that a friend of mine likes to cut off conversations with me by saying ok. I feel stupid typing this but that response just feels so dismissive and brings up unpleasant feelings like I am being looked down upon. Even though I have mentioned how their use of ok to halt a conversation bother me they still do it.Am I overreacting? Honestly am I just being stupid or is the use of ok as an end to a conversation actually dismissive?I am bad with my words so I am having trouble effectively communicating my thoughts atm I apologize in advance! I hate it when a conversation is closed with Ok,Depression
11309,11329,I wake up everyday without a purpose or anything to do. I have no one texting me no one to talk to my age. I have literally zero friends and all I see is people having good times with friends online and it makes me cry. They say these are the best years of your life and if that is the case then what is the point of trying to go on. I doubt this will get any eyes but I wish everyone a blessed future and I hope no one has to go through the same issues I am going through. I feel like I do not exist,Depression
11334,11354,After sending myself to the ER twice in two weeks because of panic attacks and loosing my therapist I am starting to loose hope. Sleeping on a broken air mattress in a living room to work 94 six days a week makes me exhausted. There are hardwood floors and the roommates dog's nails click profusely waking me up when they walk or sleep kick the floor. My therapist stopped talking to me it is been eight weeks. I am alone besides cooking in my own prep area in the kitchen other cooks are around me but we are too busy to talk. I feel so alone and I am doing out of control.I have even come to the point to the muscles in my arms hurt from how much I tense them. I want a long hug or a snuggle...to be warm happy and in good arms sounds wonderful. I really need a hug,Depression
11346,11366,Dammit another night laying in the dark scrolling reddit. Just want to sleeeeerp. cannot sleep,Depression
11361,11381,My journal writes from the year my twin brother died are indistinguishable from my writings now. I have spent the better part of the last 12 years dragging myself through trauma therapy complicated grief therapy CBT DBT medications hospitalizations and more. I am functional but I feel such relentless despair that I get dizzy facing it.His death is so fundamentally irreconcilable to me that sometimes I feel I could bring him back out of sheer will. Every passing day it feels more like a nightmare or simulation. I cannot bring myself to want to accept it when all I want in my heart is for him to have his life back. I am 25 and I am terrified that this will eat me alive. After all I have tried I do not know what kind of help to seek out and I fear I am a lost because. I do not want to be this way but I have done all I know to do and I need help. Fearing my illness is terminal but wanting it not to be,Depression
11410,11430,Only when I am drunk I am in love with this girl we share a bed right now. Everything she does makes me happy. Everytime I think of my future she has always been in my mind. Yesterday she told me that she only dates uglier guys to feel better about her self. I am already depressed and have no confidence what do ever. Idek know what to think when we were kids wed said we would Mary Each other when we were 30. Its clear that she likes me but she has about 30! Dudes on her snap and she goes out on one night stands everyday. I do not know what to think Idek,Depression
11428,11448,I met this guy on tinder and he seemed really nice and different than other men. It was too good to be true. He would tell me not to trust other guys because they will just use me. he would tell me he never lies and will always be here for me. Well of course those were just lies to get me to trust him and sleep with him. I always trust the wrong people. Later on after I slept with him he kicked me out in the middle of the night. I asked him why and first he said he was worried my mom would be upset I was out late. His second answer was that his boss was coming over and I had to leave. That made no sense so I knew something was up. He later admitted he has a wife of 3 years and he has blocked me. I feel used and worthless. I am already extremely depressed and I hate myself so much..what hurts most is that he dosen't care at all. I mentioned to him before that I was suicidal and he comepletely ignored it. All this just makes me realize how much of a useless piece of crap I am. For someone to just sleep with me and move on with ease let us me know I am not worth shit. I was so nice to him. I even tried to help his new business out by asking a bunch of people to leave 5 star google reviews for his store. what is even worse is that he planned to sleep with me then leave the state this whole time. He did not tell me he planned to leave until after he slept with me of course. I am worthless,Depression
11439,11459,My mother passed February 22 2021. I woke up to a phone call from my father who found her. I have not been the same since. I get up and go to work with a smile on my face but its all fake as fuck. I want to crawl in a hole in die. My wife has been amazing but I am not an emotionally in tune person face to face. Its hard to clean my house and do my laundry. Some days its hard to even want to live. My mother was not the greatest mom in the world but I was always a mommas boy. My mom died in February and I have not been the same.,Depression
11443,11463,I have not been diagnosed with any depressive disorders but have speculationsSince September last year 2020 I have just minimally replied to my friends that were in another college whilst I was in sixth form. I have just became super antisocial and anxious after a break up in July 2020.Today one of them asked me how I was doing and I decided to reply after ignoring the message for a month. I told them that I was depressed and anxious as hell. Although I was honest I thought I would feel better but I do not.What is wrong with me?They showed their support saying they are there if I wanted to talk and when I am ready. I basically feel the same a little bit uneasy.Too long did not read after months of isolation from my friends ignoring messages and minimally replying I finally replied today saying I was depressed and anxious lately I thought something would change like a feeling feeling better. But nothing did I still feel lonely and uneasy. What is this and what do I do? I contacted my friends after months of ignoring them,Depression
11444,11464,I honestly do not even know where to start. I do not want to dox myself or share my entire life story so I will try to keep this concise and to the point.In the spring of 2020 I went to rehab. Afterwards I moved out of state and spent 6 months in sober living. I had originally planned to spend a year and possibly start a whole new life in this new state but as fate would have it my dad's health kept getting worse and worse. Trying to be a good son I moved back home to look after him. I will be forever grateful for being able to spend the last 2 weeks or so of his life with him. He died 2 days before Christmas. I stayed with my dad's brother for about a week that was not working out. My uncle's oldest son feeling bad for me offered to let me stay with him and his wife on the condition that I stayed sober and found a job so that I could pay rent. I ended up staying with them for about 6 months until I had had enough. One day I overheard him talking with his brother on the phone bragging about how well I was doing and how hard I was working. here is what killed it for me he then starts talking about how my parents did not make it easy for me they fcked him up pretty good and then he went for the jugular I loved uncle redacted God love him but he was a fck up.Like dude it is not enough that I am working full time I am paying you money to stay here and when I am not busting my hump at my paying job I am cleaning your house washing dishes vacuuming cleaning the yard doing all the things that you are too lazy to do so you wait for your wife to deal with it. So really I am doing all these things FOR FREE to make her life easier since you will not and you thank me by disrespectinginsulting my dad who JUST DIED?! Oh hell no. To this day I still have not confronted him. Instead I have chosen to forgive him but I will never forget how that made me feel.In the effort to save face and leave as gracefully as possible I said thank you both for your hospitality I will be forever grateful it is time for me to be my own man and go my own way. That was the end of June. I have been homeless ever since.The little bit of money I have managed to save not squander away I have been slowly bleeding away living in hotels. My 2 weeks notice at my job will be up next Friday after which I will be attending a trade program for 6 weeks. I am in my mid 30's never finished 4 year college although I have an Associate's degree and these last few years I have really been racking my brain trying to figure out what to do with my life. I mean I am currently working at an auto parts factory making under 12 an hour and have been working 13 hour days for a while now and have literally nothing to show for it. I am sick and tired of breaking myself down day in and day out a prisoner of the time clock. it is time for me to find something that will pay way better than what I am doing now something where I can make a good life for myself without breaking my back something I can see me doing until I retire.I got paid today and I get paid again on the 6th. Whatever I make between now and the 6th is going to have to last me til I graduate school about halfway through September. I have reached out to friends and family on FB to see if anyone can or is willing to help hell I would even take a sublease at this point. So far no luck. Even my own mom asked me if I knew anyone who was looking to rent out a room.About the only possible saving grace I can think of at this point would either be to reach out to my local housing authority and live in section 8 for a while or to liquidate my stock portfolio and try live off that until I graduate school in September. I would really rather not have to go that route if I can help it because the stock in question is potentially poised to take the fck off soon and I would hate to miss out on a possible once in a lifetime opportunity. Normally my dad would be my 1st consultation regarding such matters but he is gone and about the only other person I have in this world that I can talk to without fear of judgement is his sister my beloved aunt who in many ways is more of like a mother than my own flesh and blood.I feel lost you all. I am broke depressed mourning stressed burnt out tired hurting and I have no idea what to do.TL DR I have been homeless since the beginning of this month after leaving my cousin's house because I refused to tolerate any further disrespect. Now I am trying to make what little money I have last until after I graduate trade school in September. It can only get better from here right?,Depression
11484,11504,Last year I went into a relationship I do not really trust anyone to heart too fast so it took a long time to trust. And when I did trust her she dumped me... I felt horrible and she never gave an answer why she dumped me. I recently met this girl and she was so sweet and caring so I trusted her too fast with my heart... she cheated in front of me with no mercy at all. This happened yesterday and I am just feeling that lifes not worth it anymore... I have been bullied for a long time and I have big insecurities should I really live any more? A teen male Relationships and suicide thoughts.,Depression
11502,11522,TW disordered eatingsuicidal ideation I do not know why I have lost all motivation to do anything either I am eating too much or too little. I am constipated as fuck. I am tired and slept for 9 hours. do not even have the motivation to cook anything so I had to order shit to the apartment I live in. I am poor and cannot hold a job for more than a month without all of the stresses building up until I break down. Makes me feel like I am acting like an entitled piece of shit who is making excuses not to work or something but I have tried the approach of just sucking up the stress and hoping it will disappear does not work like that. Parent pressured me to move out by screaming at me constantly and telling me that Ill never amount to anything in life and how I am toxic and judged me over my every move. Never really felt good enough think about killing myself but that is too much effort. Tried therapy did not work. Tried medical marijuana developed scary hallucinations. I do not know what I am doing in life I am just existing and am likely to end up out on the street likely to become a drug addict because I am nothing but a bother to people. Thinking of running away but again that is literally too much. I do not want to be here. I feel worthless,Depression
11520,11540,Santa Claus. God. Good people. The government cares about its citizens. The military treats its troops with respect instead of using them as a means to an end. Careers exist. College matters. Doctors will not lie to you to make money. We are an advanced species and do not resort to tribal ape behavior and thinking like the 'animals'. Lies. All lies. Everyday I am lied to. what is the point of keeping on when everything you believed in is lies?,Depression
11523,11543,I have had anxiety depression and mental illness much of my life. I have not been able to get proper treatment at my local mental health clinic. In some ways they have helped me immensely. I have been able to get my pure obsessional OCD under control so I no longer have such bad symptoms. It still definitely is there and sometimes flares up a bit but it is just faded background noise for the most part. In other ways my mental health has significantly deteriorated. In the mid2010s I completely lost the self confidence I had gained during my time in college when I found my tribe and got better in my art skills. I could not finish college and had to drop out due to my mental illness and ADHD and have been trying to get by as a freelance artist. I am mostly living on disability though and have not been able to earn anything close to a living wage. If I would attempted this without financial aid from the government I would be living with my parents. And if my parents had not supported me god knows where I would be. I would probably be homeless which I know happened to a college friend of mine. His parents did not support his artistic pursuits and he had to quit school because they would kicked him out. My mental health is in very bad shape and has been for several years now. Since 2017 I have been completely incapacitated by the comorbid disorders I have been dealing with. I have severe social anxiety agoraphobia body dysmorphic disorder as well as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. I also have CPTSD. My parents have to drive me everywhere because driving terrifies me and I cannot even call a taxi because of my social anxiety and CPTSD which makes me terrified of being in a space with people I do not know where there is no quick exit sitting with a taxi driver would mean I would be unable to escape easily if they turned out to be mean I know it is highly unlikely but it still scares me. My friend had one experience with a mean taxi driver when she was in her late teens.So I had the crazy idea of trying out a drawingart video blog as it seems to be lucrative and you tubers earn a passive income which I think would be great instead of just relying on government financial aid. I want to do it but I do not think I would be any good at it. It actually seems impossible for me because even though I have decent drawing skills I have no people skills. I am socially handicapped by my mental disorders. One of the main reasons I draw is because I have such a hard time talking to people and drawing helps make me feel more comfortable around them. I have no idea how I would ever feel comfortable enough to talk on camera and not scare people away. I do not want to be insincere or fake and pretend to be more talkative and bubbly than I am. I have actually thought of doing a voice changer thing or just captions as talking just scares the hell out of me. I am scared of my voice or name being recognized by bullies and being stalked and harassed in real life or online. I may try one video and perhaps not even post it but just get a feel for it and if it does not work I will not bother. It is a multiskilled vocation to be an art vlogger. You have to also have good people skills as well as videomaking skills. I hate the idea of only video blogging with the hope of earning money but hating people. I like it when the youtuber is genuinely friendly and acknowledges their followers and all that. I would not want to put people off with my unfriendliness from social anxiety and not responding to comments or messages or turning off comments. I just do not really know what to do with myself. I am not cut out for this existence. I feel powerless I am a mess and do not know how to prevent my life from going to sht,Depression
11548,11568,So idk if this is the right place to post this but I need some form of motivation. I have an assignment to submit in about an hour and I am only halfway through. Plus an IA tomorrow that I genuinely have not even prepared for. I missed a few other assignments for a different course and do not feel like going to class as of late. Finals in a week. I just sit around thinking and... nothing. Basically doing nothingAm I going down a bad spiral? I am normally a quite optimistic guy that just let us everything work out by itself. What should I do? Advice needed,Depression
11554,11574,I got prescribed to months worth of Lexapro and to take half a tablet a day right before my insurance expired they were trying to get me enough lexapro to last me until I find new insurance. That was two months ago and I have been afraid of taking it since.I smoke weed on the daily because it helps calm my nerves for like 30 minutes so I could work on my writing and get in the zone. However in the past week I have been incredibly depressed and the upcoming death of my cat I fear will make that 10x worse it already is.Is it worth taking Lexapro or do you think it will kill my creativity? I can be creative without weed its just a small jumpstart. I am more scared of losing it to the lexapro but I am also scared of my lack of motivation energy and depression. I am trying to work on changing my lifestyle but its been years and though I had a good 3week period wo depression after getting the pills aka I did not have any anymore I was back to square one and its been getting worse since. Lexapro is it worth it?,Depression
11568,11588,I am not quite suicidal but I am not quite okay. I am I am limbo. I lay in bed trying to sleep and I have so much anxiety about going to work. Numb from depression. My family wants to celebrate Christmas in July and usually Christmas songs and movies give me that warm fuzzy childhood feeling. I feel void. I lay in bed I do not want to face the day. I want to sleep. Stay in bed. I think if I die my problems would go away. But at the same time I do not want to die. I want to enjoy life. I sink to that level of borderline SI but then I go back to thinking how I could improve my life.Today I got a friend request from my cousin. you would think that would cheer me up. No. It made me more depressed and feeling useless. The reason? Three week ago I sent her a friend request. No reply. No response. I assumed she just does not check her social media often. However it occurred to me today. If she sent me a friend request that means she declined my friend request 3 weeks ago. Otherwise it would have said she accepted my friend request. That means she must have felt guilty and friended me out of obligation. My own family does not care about me or my life. Her first instinct was to not friend me. I am lost. Any advice? I am in Limbo. Anyone Relate?,Depression
11571,11591,My beloved furbaby of 17yo passed yesterday. I have had her since birth she followed me everywhere wanted to be by my side for everything and even has moved countries with me. After 24 hours of crying and feeling everything from anger to waves of sadness to the absolute numbness that normally comes with my depression it feels like that little band that helped me function has snapped again. I do not want to sound so dramatic that I am like this because I have lost my dog but God damn it I am like this because I have lost my best friend. I am scrolling through photos and clinging to her collar. My family think I am crazy for reacting like this to a dog's death and yet I struggle to think of how I will act normal in work on Monday. I have no idea what is bringing me to post this. I just want to say somewhere that I am feeling all of this whirlwind of grief and numbness it feels like there is a weight on my chest but my chest is hollow. My dog died and the grief is just hard to fight,Depression
11591,11611,I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for a couple of years now. I am in the 3rd year of my university have 1 year left. I really do not know what to do after that. I am seriously considering dropping out. I feel I do not know anything and I am not good at anything. I feel I will never get a job and even if I do I will suck at it. I do not really like what I study but I also do not have anything else that I like. I have done 2 internships and I sucked at both and I hated every bit of it.I am supposed to do another internship as a part of my course. And still have not been able to even start applying. Just thinking of the fact that I have to sit for an interview makes me so anxious and I get panic attacks. I do not think I will ever be able to do or have a job. Every time I read a job post I feel I am incompetent. What to write in a cover letter? and what to say? I am not good at anything. Hence I want to drop out.But if I drop out then what to do?If I do finish my last year after that what?Uni is expensive and my parents are paying for it I really do not want them to pay for 1 more year just for me to do nothing.I Feel Like a loser I do not have any confidence nor any friends. I am always lonely sad and crying. Need some advice.,Depression
11605,11625,Honestly I feel like shit. I feel like my life is driven by sadness hate and blind anger. Otherwise I do not feel anything. Otherwise I feel absolutely nothing. I do not care about anything and I do not want to do anything. I found that things I used to love bring me very little to none satisfaction at all. I cannot make decisions on my own. I spend all night long crying until it is morning. And the absolute worst is that I cannot talk about it with anyone. All my friends are normal and do not like all this depression shit. Last time I talked with them about it they said that I do not have depression and I am just a poser. I do not want to talk about it with my parents neither. And my therapist does not really help. I feel like no one understands me. My mom said it is just a stage a few months ago. But is it really just a stage? Is it really just a stage?,Depression

11679,11699,My mental health has been destroyed for the past 16 years of my life. I grew up always having dreams about what I want to do in the future but I am stuck in a life where I am not allowed to have any control over myself. This kind of pain hurts worse than not being able to control my own life. I cannot wait to turn 18 and recover from the life I am being forced to live or die in the process. I cannot wait for people to give me my fucking freedom forever. I hate being 17,Depression
11696,11716,Since last summer I am in a spiral of losing myself. I am currently working on my master thesis in architecture together with my girlfriend who also lives with me. Since the beginning I started to have this episodes where I am completely overwhelmed and then I unable to do anything anymore believe in anything or feel anything. First I hoped that this will just go away if we push through but it became worse and worse. I reached out for help I am seeing a therapist visited my doctor who gave me citalopram and I am taking 10mg since 4 days. So I am working on getting better but I started to ask myself Am I really depressed or am I just procrastinating at an absurd level? I mean I am weeping daily because of our thesis and I just do not see me working on or even finishing it. I have better days but as soon as it gets harder I just crumble. Am I just so lazy that I put myself in this misery so I do not have to work? I will also talk to my therapist but she is in holidays now.. And it would help me to hear if anyone of you had this feeling of Am I just faking it? Am I faking my depression?,Depression

11751,11771,I have suffered from depression my whole life but as I have gotten older it has gotten worse.I see the years passing me by and I have absolutely nothing to show for it. I have no girlfriend no friends all I do is work come home and sleep. I have no interest in anything not even the things that once were of interest to me.I am disgusted by myself. I cannot connect to others. I am always alone.Sometimes I do not mind. I have almost gotten her to it but as of lately its been nipping away at me.I have tried every antidepressant anti anxiety medication TMS changing diet working out..you name it. I have tried it. And yet nothing seems to work. There is no point to this message. I just needed to vent. I am so lonely.,Depression
11753,11773,I am a virgin and I want to have sex but I know my partner would never make a first move without my enthusiastic consent. The thing is during cuddlingmaking out it is hard for me to be present enough to show enthusiasm or to try to move things in a sexual direction. Like I just get dissociative and quiet. it is not that I am uncomfortable if anything I feel so comfortable and safe that my brain just wants to shut off and rest. they will be touching me and kissing me and stuff and I will be enjoying it but my brain just goes so numb that I cannot express my feelings or reciprocate. Anyone have any advice? in my first real relationship and struggling to be present during intimacy,Depression
11767,11787,I live in a semitropical area where plants take over everything but I feel like I have this horticultural curse that reflects on my life in general. I have tried to grow plants for years even building wooden planters but then once the plants sprout I leave them outside where they get destroyed by inevitable torrential rain. I just moved and have a dirt backyard that gets sun so I hoed the dirt up and planted grass seed after reading how to do it but even in this area I messed it up somehow. I also bought and planted some already grown peppers but I know I will abandon them to being eaten by insects or just not ever eat what grows on them. The only things I have grown successfully are basil and hot peppers but I just left them without eating them until I used them up. it is reflective of everything else I do in life really. I just do not care enough to do anything I once was happy doing. I have cut off contact with all friends completely fake my conversations never play music drink too much do not exercise and stopped taking medications and going to therapy a couple years ago since I realized I cannot even be honest with myself and was definitely not honest with my therapist. I feel like seeing grass grow will be something that helps me feel like I have not completely abandoned my will to live. I cannot even get grass to grow!,Depression
11790,11810,its safe to say I have been really depressed lately its usually more of episodes followed by feeling okay followed by another episode for me and I cannot stop thinking my bf has fallen out of love or I am not good enough etc. and its causing me to want to just. cuddle him constantly or be with him most the time and I can tell its getting on his nerves and I do not want to be like that lol we live together and both 20years old can depression make me act clingy??,Depression

11845,11865,This has been a horrible week. Yesterday I lost my job and its all my fault. I suffer from major depression and anxiety. I would been on medication but since I would changed jobs I had to stop taking them because the insurance at my new job has not kicked in yet. It would have August 1. So I have been off it because it was just too expensive for me to buy. I have been feeling horrible and just angry and pissed off. I take full responsibility for my actions because it was not the job but me. I could not get myself motivated enough while at work so the shift supervisor was critzing my work. I was getting upset and arguing with her and anyone else who was trying to help me. I was not even sure how long I was going to last to be honest. The boss pulled me into her office yesterday morning and informed me she would had received too many emails about my behavior. I was told I needed to change my behavior or I would be fired. I just started there on June 21 and I already had too many complaints against me. My heart nor my head were into the job and I decided to quit. I already knew I would not make it. I hate feeling this way. However I was so depressed I could not get myself to commit to the job. It was night shift which I do not like but at the time I needed the job. Lost my job Yesterday,Depression
11858,11878,Everyone is tired of talking to me nobody is responding my posts or texts I am just a drain on everyone. I am so negative and bitter and unhappy I have nothing but pain and anger pent up within meIm lonely I am sad I feel like a burden on others and everyone is just tired of me. Everything feels pointless in my life I work in retail and stuck in it I work every weekend while everyone else gets to do things and have fun. I cannot afford my own apartment I have no idea how to live on my own I do not have a car I am still single and cannot find a date to save my life I cannot afford college or a mastersgrad schoolIm a Grade A loser I feel so alone and hopeless that I could cry. Everyone wants everybody else to be positive and outgoing partners want their prospective date to be equally ambitious and fun and I am none of these things I am so tired Nobody cares,Depression
11862,11882,27yo Male good life experiences including backpacking Vietnam visited Paris and Barcelona enjoyed cities like Nashville Boston Montreal Scottsdale moved to FL with my gf at 25 on a whim. Successful sales career making six figures since 21 averaged a new car every 9 months and currently own 5. On my second home owned which is valued at 500k. Working on opening my first business now. I wanted to include this because I feel people that know me on the outside assume I would be extremely happy with my life and my successes but if anything it is caused me more pain and loneliness and THINGS are not the answer to anyone's depression. Also do not assume the people that appear to be in good places really are in their mind we just bandaid our problems with stuff to hide our problems from ourselvesI have struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life as early as 3rd grade I can remember pitifully trying to strangle myself with a balloon string sounds silly how unrealistic that was looking back. I have tried ecstacy a handful of times but never in conjunction with peaks of depression and anxiety. After almost 8 years in the car business which definitely worsened my depressionanxiety significantly i left to explore myself and start my own business which really took a toll on myself. This worsened since I took myself off of buproprion and sertraline 5 months ago after losing my insurance. Recently my girlfriend and I decided to do some ecstacy with just us at home it was extremely therapeutic in regard to my mental health. There are 100 health downsides I am sure to this but for my extremely infrequent use I am not worried about the downsides. here is how it helped me.To describe my mental health state prior to I felt very empty and constantly in fight or flight. I have very little enjoyment in anything and found myself breaking down and crying more often to a breaking point. Why was I breaking down and crying? Because I felt so guilty thinking how badly I wish I could just disappear and how unfair it was to tell my sister who just had her first child that I did not want to be there to watch him grow. Or to tell my girlfriend that i do not want to start our life and family together because I would rather be gone. To clarify i do not want to hurt or kill myself. But i cried even harder because I also was so destroyed realizing that the only answer is to stay and feel so empty and useless for the sake of everyone else which meant a life of pain for me. There was no winning.When we did ecstacy it allowed me to feel again assuming a Seratonin pump and it allowed me to appreciate. I was able to hold my girlfriend and just feel joy feel how much she meant to me and how much i enjoyed her presence. It allowed me to remember what made life worth living what happiness was like. I was able to work through all those thoughts inside with a fresh palate and an open mind. I was able to address things with myself that i was afraid to address. Think ways that I have not been able to for a long time. I had a shit eating grin the entire time and just felt so alive again. The next day was even better because it was a much lesser baseline but just enough to get through the day with the ability to feel good. Eventually the euphoria went away but my mind was at ease. Just because the high stopped i was still able to work through my thoughts with myself and affirm my reasoning for being around. Unlike other drugs you will likely remember your experience from ecstacy and similar drugs so that you can take away your thoughts with you. All in all if you are in a very stuck place and unable to crawl out i honestly feel a controlled experience like this may be good to let you revisit your life from a new perspective again and reason your way out of your hole. I am curious to hear people's opinions on this either for or against. Happy to answer questions as well. Anyone use Ecstacy while depressed? My experience.,Depression
11879,11899,long ago when I broke up with my boyfriend I had cut off communication with him but for some reason I needed to talk to him we became friends and for some reason I cried for the slightest things and i got mad for no reason was it normal? I am asking because when we broke up i was so sad it started to be part of my depression but I am ok I am taking my pills i need help help,Depression
11888,11908,I am so lonely I am so alone,Depression
11901,11921,I usually watched new shows at the end of the day to make me feel good and its been working but all of the sudden I just cannot feel happy or good even with my favorite shows. I am not bored of it or its not like its bad I just cannot find the happiness I had before when watching them and its so frustrating. That was one of the last things I can do to make myself feel good and it just all the sudden does not work. I know this is such a small thing because its just a show but that is where I was getting so much joy I just lost every bit of interest in one of my favorite activities,Depression
11907,11927,They do say ignorance is bliss. I am just saying that I truly doubt someone who jokes about suicide in any context has never experienced how tragic suicide is and it is literally never funny.,Depression
11909,11929,Why am I just never good enough? I had a pretty depressing and neglected childhood. My brother was always the favorite kid and anything I accomplished never mattered. If my brother even got 70 percent my parents would literally treat him like a prince and if I got the same marks or more in fact I never even got single praise out of their mouth. When I was about 10 years I had to relocate to another city only because my brother was in a boarding school and he was very homesick. I was homeschooled for 2 years and no one cared about me. A real example when my brother was in 10th he got about 68 percent in his board examination and he was sent for a trip with his friends because my parents were proud and when I was in 10th I got 93 and I did not even get a well done or I am proud of you it was just okay why did you get fewer marks in science. I recently got the presidency for 2 departments in my school and when I told my mother she just said okay can you fucking believe it just an OKAY. I just never feel enough be it in my family my friendships or my relationship. Whatever I do I can never be good enough. At this point I do not even know if anyone cares about me for a second. I do not remember the last time I felt happy all I remember is feeling sad that is IT THE ONLY EMOTION I FEEL. I hate feelings I hate getting attached I hate trusting someone I have my mother I hate it. I do not know if anyone will relate but I always feel like I have lost myself. This just is not me. I lost myself and I cannot seem to find her again. It just does not get fucking easy it is just torture. why am I never good enough?,Depression
11926,11946,it is not working. I love this dog. he is the best. But I still want to die right now and it is starting to get worse again. I have had him for almost a year and it is been equally hard on my anxiety but I am slowly teetering on killing myself again even though I know he really loves me.I do not know what to do Got a dog to hedge against suicide,Depression
11943,11963,I just want to sleep forever I do not want to do anything else. Is there a painless way to kill myself? There Is No Reason For Me To Live,Depression
11946,11966,If you do manage to get rich women will come after you to steal it because good artists copy and great artists steal so that they can run a story on you on how deeply flawed you are and how perfect they are. Why life is a rigged game because the internet is owned by women,Depression
11951,11971,I am single and never been in a real relationship out of the fact that that idea of commitment scares me and I have not met anyone that i feel comfortable enough to say i date them. Recently I have had a string of recurring dreams of women whether I am close to them or feel an attraction to them whether its a genuine connection or sexual pleasures varies but one thing is the same i wake up and am saddened. After each one of those dreams my first thought is it was a dream huh?. Although it is also my own fault since my inability to know fact from fiction in my dreams is addictive like being in a VR game where I am happy until i take the headset off. Deep down i find myself craving those dreams and try to lie to myself like i do not just so I do not think about how pathetic i feel. The truth is I am so alone and it scares me. Opening up to people personally is extremely hard since just like my choice of love interest I am picky with who i talk with. Its easier to think of it has having certain levels of access. My closest friends having the highest access to my feelings and thoughts while everyday friends barely have access to what i want them to see of me. I have not had a close friend since early to mid highschool which was a few years ago and without anyone i trust enough to be a close friend I am stuck with my own thoughts trying to figure out how to feel. For the longest I thought id be fine i did not need anyone else but truth is my own mind is eating itself alive and bit by bit I am losing parts of me and it will only get worse. I cannot stop it at this point. I have lost a lot of myself and fear this is the spiral to the end and I am desperately clinging for a hand that i ultimately will never take.I am sorry to the future person i choose to help me with this baggage. I hope to one day find one who can put up with me A cry for help even though I am too closed off to accept help,Depression
11953,11973,This is my first serious relationship even though I am 30. I do not know if its anhedonia nothing is giving me joy right now. My boyfriend calls me the love of his life and wants to plan the rest of his life with me.I am over the relationship and him. I do not see this working long term.I just want to run away and move away. I feel horrible because he has been an absolute star and so amazing. But I feel like I am obliged to be with him. I do not miss him. I feel trapped.Is this my depression luring its ugly head or is this super normal for everything to fizzle after a year. Is it my depression? Or am I out of love with my boyfriend after a year.,Depression
12003,12023,dude. I am trying to figure out how to actually be proud of who i am but its proving to be a herculean task. i just end up thinking around in circles telling myself that I am shit and should just do better without rambling about all the garbage I am feeling. even making this post somehow feels like I am seeking external validation to make myself feel better. i do not know. i feel like this is something i have to figure out by myself but at the same time I am going to go insane if i do not let all this nonsense out somewhere. my inner critic is so damn loud,Depression
12046,12066,No one cares about guys at all. I could die and they would be mad at me not sad or anything. I feel like a tool not a person. Whenever a guy gets angry cos that is the only way we know how to vent were called assholes or when I try and vent like a normal person I get called a drama queen. Especially when they get used to you never talking about your feelings like when you do you can see them liking you less cos now they have to deal with your emotionsMost peopleI hate how I see people talking about their issues and everyone is supporting and I get angry internally not that they do not deserve it but watching someone do something I crave so bad but cannot do makes me so sad I just do not understand why,Depression
12075,12095,They say I need to improve my confidence. They say I need to improve my selfesteem. Honestly to this day I 30F still have no clue how to do that. Sometimes I like to imagine what life could be like if I was confident. And it usually revolves around everyone loving me. And then it just makes me that much more sad when reality hits me and I realize that none of these people give a fuck about me. I do not know if I am making any sense at all. My perception of myself is just screwed I guess. I think I am more attractive and likable and funny than I really am. So then when I am faced with reality it hits that much harder. I feel like no matter what I try to do I just cannot win. Trying to Escape Reality,Depression

12174,12194,HelloI do not have anyone to talk with so i will write it here because i have need to ventilate my feelings out so thanks everyone for hearing me.Since childhood i'v been always fat. It was caused by bad working thyroid gland and excessive sugar income. And it is well know that fat people have really small penis in my case i have also circumcision because of something that happened when i was really young. My face is also not one of the most beautiful. Because of that my self confidence is literaly below zero.I had a crush for 13 years on primary and secondary school. I never told her that i was in love with her.First of all it was just because of lack of self confidence. When i was older i realized where is relationship there must be sex. And i cannot have sex because of my problem i mentioned.I had to cut all our connections and go on in my life.Once there was girl and it seemed that she may like me or even love. I had to send her away cut all our connections and go on in my life. I did this everytime with every woman i'v met because i was afraid that even with my look friendship with girl could grown in something more serious.There was a time when i came to terms with it and i peacefuly lived on. But last couple years it is killing me I am crying almost every night I am not smiling anymore and this loneliness is really painfull.I would like to have a person i could share my life with enjoy moments of life together smile and love each other. But i know i cannot fulfill women's desires.

Feeling bad thinking about just dumb things that are not true,Depression
12238,12258,I have a close friend who is going through a lot right now. We are both minors and he is hesitant about asking his parents to see a therapist so he will vent to me occasionally. A lot of times it feels like I am always saying the wrong things in response and a lot of the time he will start to vent then after a few minutes he will think that he is said enough and that he is bothering me by talking about his problems. I have actually been in therapy for a few months now so he also stops talking because I have my own problems I need to deal with and he does not want to add on his stupid emotional baggage. Most of the time I really do not mind if he vents and I want to have an actual conversation with him where he does not stop responding after 3 minutes. I am glad that he at least starts to talk to me about things I think that is better than nothing but I do not really know how to address things or how to actually be of help. How can I support him? What should not I say or what should I say? What do I do? How can I help a friend who may have depression?,Depression
12239,12259,This year i finally sought out help and got my life back together got a girlfriend got a job made some friends. Girlfriend cheated on me i got sent death threats from the guy she hooked up with saying that he caught feelings for her and i needed to back down or get killed. He told me to kill myself and then the next day told me he had bipolar disorder and that i needed to help him not kill himself. I now am weighed down by the man who took my girlfriend asking me to help him as he talks about how much he loves her. I lost multiple friends and they just sort of ghosted me i had a date tonight but she cancelled and said she never really was interested in me. Everything is dark and whenever someone says you are just a kid you have your whole life ahead of you i feel like yelling at them because i just do not want to have to keep being mercilessly effed by life. my life has been rough but not as bad as others,Depression

12336,12356,Relationships have never worked for me. In my adult years I have worked hard to be self reliant and happy with myself. I go to therapy finally got on meds trying to eat right and exercise. Most of the time I am great.But every time I start to think hm I should let someone else in! I am reminded why I shut everyone out over a decade ago. My therapist says I need to let people in but it is like... there is a wall there for a reason? We did not put that up for fun? It was not fun at all and took blood sweat and tears to realize that even though I do not like myself I sure cannot depend on anyone else.Also I feel stupid when I get hopeful. And think I can let someone in.Then either it turns out I overestimated. Or even better they do like me but I require DEVOTION before I can trust them and of course as any sane person would they run. I am like that blob comic where they get punched and go back in the box now with thicker wallsNever again! Pretty sure I am meant to be alone?,Depression

12402,12422,To start i do not know how to start. I am writing just to get out of my own head. As far as i can remember there has always been a hole in me. I know insert joke here. But seriously i have to fake emotions on a daily bases. let us be clear i can feel feelings but two is all i have. Sadness and anger. But because of this need to belong i try to be more human but end up slipping up and going into self destructive mood. I have screwed up time and time again. And in the wake of my destruction i hurt my family not with physical abuse but because of my actions i keep them at arms length at all times never allowing them to see the real me. I lie cheat and steal. I have had and still have a addiction problem which helps self medicate my mood swings and depression. My earliest memories from where this void started was when i was 8 or 9. A friend hung himself accidentally with a swing set chain. I was not strong enough to left him up and out. Each time i could manage to pick him up the weight of his body dropped and the chain got tighter. He did not die. A neighbor heard me scream and rushed to save him. I will never forget the feeling of hopelessness that creep into me that day. I was not the hero here that i thought one day i would become. From there on years turned into decades and that feeling of self worth i lost became to much to bear. For a time being i felt comfort in an older women but was ultimately taking advantage of. At 15 i was sleeping with a married 35yr old women who just like me was broken. But broken in a different way. Her husband was dying and i guess we both used each other to one extant to an other to feel a quick sense of release. A release of stress and sadness but it was fleeting and to avoid her misconduct she tried to pin everything on me. Telling friends and coworkers i was stalking her. Which was further then the case. My closet friends laughed and believe every drop of bull shit she came up with. My friends i thought know my character better and would have stuck up with me. But they did not and in the end her husband came into the restaurant we both worked and told my boss and coworkers the truth. My friends apologize and said they should have know better bah bah. But all i felt was that void grow bigger with every mustered up excuses they had to justify their betrayal. If you just told us one of them said. Sure that would have made everything better. Dear such and such i have been screwing or 35 manager on the weekends at work. What do not believe me? that is weird. To tell the truth i did not much believe it either and i was the one getting banged. that is when a switch turned off and i started to numb the emptiness with pot and pills. that is the most i can write today. I feel alittle better and less crazy. Ill write more later on. I did beat the battle of drugs and depression for a while. But the war is always on going. Thank you for letting me vent. Trust me more will follow There and back again. An manic tale,Depression
12432,12452,I am someone who has struggled with low self esteem perfectionism and passiveness all my life. But I always put it away finding escapism on the internet or things like a fandom. Not thinking about those insecurities not thinking about myself. Only thinking about how things might be better in the future but not thinking about me in the present moment. I am good at putting on a smile and feeling fine for a moment and sometimes I can feel good when being more active but somehow I think I not only tricked others but sometimes also myself. But honestly are you really okay when you are spending hours and hours doing nothing a day? Not doing anything? And just hating yourself both outside and inside? Just somewhat existing but that is it. I have only had two therapy sessions so far to cope with my negative selfimage and compulsive tendencies and it is like finally it clicked with me HOW unhappy and lost I am. No you are not fine just because you are not suicidal. it is hard but I think I am getting to a point where I am realising that I am fucking insecure and that my life is empty. Maybe realising this will be a turning point.Every summer I feel incredibly lonely. While everyone is off having fun I basically let two months pass by like it is nothing. I work but other time is spent scrolling on the internet. Jealousy of others having fun comes over me but I know ultimately it is down to me never asking my friends to do something I think because I am afraid they really do not want to spend time with me in the end. I can be social and outgoing when I am in class but once I come home I feel empty and I spend the rest of my day on my own in my own head. Lately I have really come to terms with the fact that yes I fucking struggle mentally. it is like every summer I realise that yes I do feel fucking lonely. I have friendships but they are superficial and I never really know how to voice my insecurities and thoughts with them. I miss meaningful friendships in my real life. I have lost friendships and it is totally due to my own lack of assertiveness. it is not that I did something wrong but I just did nothing. I do really hate myself for certain decisions I have made and not putting more effort in my life but I also do not know where to start.it is like finally I am realising for myself that I am lost I do not have it all together and I do not have to pretend I do because I cannot keep fooling myself. I am disappointed with myself and I am not really coping with how unsatisfied I am with my life. And it frustrates me to no end that I see people being busy and happy but that I feel constantly as I am missing that one thing that can make me like these people. I want to change so bad and be better live normally. But I do not know how. It sounds weird but I am done pretending to be fine and accept my depressive feelings to work on them.,Depression
12492,12512,Because all my friends are either busy or also depressed and even suicidal like me. Because no one understands and that makes me resent them more.Because they do not know how to help which only makes me feel worse.Because they turn it around and make it about themselves.This is too much for anyone untrained to deal with not even therapists do much to help and I really hate feeling like a burden and frustrating people. I hate feeling selfish. I am still just waiting to die. My physical health keeps worsening so perhaps I can bet on that. Why do not you reach out to someone?,Depression
12519,12539,I have had this depression for years I get meds and go to a therapist but lately it is been so bad that I have seriously thought aboyt hurting myself. I know I cannot do it because I am conscious of what I could because to people who care about me but i still think about doing it. One night i took 4 anxiety pills which it is more than I should take but I knew it would not because any harm even If i knew that I went to sleep hoping I would die while sleeping or at least feel better when I woke up. Instead I woke up without the anxiety I had but feeling more depressed without energy and not wanting to do anything even if I had lots of work to do. I stayed in bed all day sleeping and not even looking at my phone I ate just once that day. No one insisted that I got out of bed since i said i was feeling sick. Now I have even more things to do because I lost that entire day. I am deeply unmotivated and I just want to disappear nothing makes me feel better and I stopped liking all the activities that used to make me feel good.I do not know what I expect from this post so feel free to comment whatever you want What to do when I really want to hurt myself?,Depression
12523,12543,This past year and a half have been absolutely terrible for me. I went into college with hope and excitement to finally start my life only to be kept in my dorm room the entire time and have almost no college experience. Last fall I became depressed and my grades dropped dramatically but over the winter I got back into school and really brought my grades up. Only to hear on the week of finals that my brother in the Navy who I had not seen for over two years passed away. This led to me ultimately failing one of my required classes that I failed in the fall. Over this summer I worked at appealing my scholarship and taking classes to help boost my GPA. But because my family's expected family contribution was slightly too high I could not receive the scholarship I desperately need to afford school. The school has not given me any aid or support and my parents cannot take out a loan. I am having a really difficult time coping with this and I am having thoughts of considering to just end it. I worked so hard and Covid took so much away from me. I am terrified of even trying to start over because I am afraid I will lose something or someone else important to me. Thanks for reading this. Lost everything I worked for do not see much of a reason to keep going,Depression
12557,12577,I am too scared to go outside. This is so anti climactic. it is a beautiful day I want to go out but last time I did a kid insulted me said I was an ugly f I went home and attempted suicide. Scared of that happening again.

12564,12584,My aunt did a form of Persian palm reading on my hands and told me that Id have no lasting love or relationship in my lifetime. I am depressed not because of that but its funny because if I was neurotypical Id probably lose more sleep over that event. Now even if its true for me I shrug it off since I am too depressed to even prioritize that connection Anyways thanks for listening Its all just a simulation anyways When I was 10,Depression
12588,12608,I filled my summer with a 95 internship I exhaust myself during the day and I spend the rest of my time playing video games until I am tired enough to sleep but as soon as I have just 5 minutes for myself I have a breakdown. When is this going to end. When escapism is not enough anymore,Depression
12591,12611,I stopped self harming I stopped looking down on myself i have stopped what everybody wants me to stop but I still want to kill myself I got grounded from my friends my mom is super homophobic and abusive CPS was supposed to come a YEAR ago nobody cares about me my therapist cancelled my therapist is not the best she told me how to get out of taking my meds and if I tell my psychiatrist anything I will get hospitalized the best thing for me now is to just kill myself I am done,Depression
12597,12617,Now that I am in my 30s I realise my depression maybe because by both my parents being depressed. I know genetically it can be transferred but I am wondering if nurture wise it can be passed on? I notice that I also think negatively never solutions to problems and I know this is from my mom.My parents have no hobbies or interests and either do I but I am thinking this is because I did not grow up seeing this or being in that sort of environment. These are just 2 examples but do you think it is possible? Can having depressed parents because children to me depressed,Depression
12604,12624,it is like I have lost the energy to just.. exist. I am not even able to do simple things like watch my favorite shows or play my favorite games. it is more of a chore than something to enjoy.I kind of just lay in bed all day and do nothing. I have been stuck in a really bad rut and I do not really know how to get out of it. The approach of school soon are not really helping it either. I am not sure what I will do when it comes to studying considering I barely have the energy to get up and shower some days. Boy what a mess. I am really tired all the time.,Depression
12609,12629,Ever cried for nothing especially when you want to sleep and you burst into tears that is normal guys do not ever felt that no once looking at you i have always been bursting to tears after my father left at home because of a fight and i have self esteem since that then my father always beat me with a belt since i was 4 and put me on a sack and hung me up on a tree for 6 hour straight and when i was 13 i got home around 11PM since a little project at that time i have told my father the reason why i did not come home around 900 pm i was beaten on the ground and was hit with a belt an was shot with a airsoft gun on my body around 27 Plastic bullets and i was force to knelt on the Plasti bullets after that and i always get bullied at school when it was turning January 1 2020 i got a fight with my father and i fight back since I am 18 at that time and he left my mother blame me of that incident and i always do not talk mu problems with someone else and I do not kind of have close friends.... This is my story that why i got my depression,Depression
12621,12641,I feel like every step I take not only do I get knocked back 2 steps but when I stop and look around I am just climbing stairs to a destroyed building. that is what my depression feels like. I cannot go anywhere but backwards but even then there is nothing waiting for me at the end. I just do not know what to do anymore. It seems Everytime I try to better myself everything and anything uses its power to stop me. All I do is try everyday but at this point I do not even want to wake up or do anything. I wish I could just never wake up or wake up In a different body somewhere else. Is there any point to walk up these stairs or ladders?,Depression
12642,12662,He told me before he has depression and is on meds for it. I also know hes got a LOT of stresses right now. But I do not want to look foolish by continuing to reach out to him. How can I know if my romantic interest is isolating due to depression or if hes losing interest?,Depression
12662,12682,I do not know why but I can kill myself even if I want to die and I really want to hurt myself.I hate me a lot and I want me to suffer but even when I cut myself I do it where it cannot really harm myself where it is just a bit of pain and distracts me for a moment from other thoughts.I guess I prefer to die more naturally like in a car accident or from illness.the best way to die for me would be doing some heroic shit like saving someone from a car crash or a fire I would be proud of myself for a moment at least and hopefully it would hurt less to my family and friends if I die doing something good instead of killing me to stop this suffer. I am a coward self harm suicidal post,Depression
12692,12712,Things have changed. Even before the pandemic things were bad in terms of meeting people but now it is even worse. it is almost and probably is impossible.The city I live in is unique in terms of it as a high turnover rate therefore incidences of meeting people specifically bad people is higher than normal cities. But nevertheless the same trials and tribulations go on anywhere. But being said everything in this post is tailored to the city that I live in.But what happened? It is so difficult to meet anybody anymore. Older women like women my age they are broken bruised jaded and fed up because they are approached by pieces of garbage constantly. he is gotten to the point where I cannot even make eye contact with a woman when I am walking past her on a sidewalk. They literally look down or look away because they are tired of being approached. Also the guide to girl ratio here is out of control. there is got to be at least 10 guys for every woman that is available. Then you factor in everything from the unique primal intrigue that flows through the veins of any human being in this city and again it is impossible. Within this gigantic sea of terrible men there are few Good Men drowning not even being thrown a life preserver. it is a shame. it is a waste of time energy good souls and the possibility of memorable love. I am tired of fighting through the walls being built by women and forged by pieces of garbage men. I am fed up and it makes me enormously depressed.I never had a problem dating in this city in the past but now I cannot get a foot in the door a word in edgewise and I know it is not me. Even the caliber of personality shared with most women in this city has gotten more judgmental and aggressive. Most of the women that are younger they want money. They want a sugar daddy without realizing that we just came through a pandemic where most people are not as flush with cash anymore due to inflation.Then you have a lot of leftleaning liberal women who will not even talk to a person who is a centrist. Since when did politics have to play a huge role in dating? In the worst of it is the vaccine. If you did not get a vaccine you are basically a piece of shit to everyone who did. And I thought there was a law in place that protected your personal medical privacy. What do I know.What I do know is all of it makes me so depressed and feel so lonely. I am a good guy dedicated intelligent talented. Every single night after the sun sets reality sets into how lonely I really feel. And there is this dark hope inside of me saying there is somebody out there but I really do not think so.We dug our own holes here. we have become so selective so judgmental some materialistic so singleminded our eyes are not open and we push people away. we would rather be alone because we are afraid to catch a virus. we would rather be alone because we do not want to deal with the possibility of somebody losing their job and becoming dependent on the other. we would rather be alone because it is easier to lump everybody into a category that supports a divide that is country wide.Where I agree with most of that and I am an introvert so I understand being alone but damn do I want to hold somebody is hand. the state of dating...,Depression
12695,12715,Hey guys I am not in such a bad spot right now that I need anything immediate. But I need therapy. I absolutely cannot afford it right now. What are some holdmeovers until I can get health insurance through my work? I have got to go I think 36 months before I am eligible. I purchased a journal yesterday to try and help write myself out on paper. I also am deciding to go completely sober. I am even going to try to drop caffeine. I stopped nicotine about 6 months ago. And have been successful with it. I cut down my caffeine intake but it is still regular. As for alcohol I have cut way back. But I still have a binge every so often with friends. I smoke green regularly and intend to stop that too. What are other ideas to keep me around until I can get some professional help? I need help,Depression
12697,12717,You may not see my depression but it is with me at all times. It is the pooling of tears in my eyes while I am driving making it hard to see oncoming traffic. It is the secretive yet frantic wiping away of tears when I breakdown and do not want my significant other to see me crying. It is the laying awake at night staring at the ceiling revisiting memories that inflict hurt and pain and not being able to stop. It is the stressing about the future and then reassuring myself its alright by realising that by then I probably would have taken my own life and will not have to deal with it. It is the staring out into the distance thinking of ways to kill myself and not hearing a word someone said while talking to me. It is the zoning back in after and realising that my suicidal thoughts so frequent can devour my mind entirely at any time. It is the realisation that I have been suffering for years on end and likely will continue to suffer for the rest of my life. It is shaking of my legs and the biting of my nails. It is losing interest in literally everything and not knowing how to spend my days. It is distracting myself as much as possible so my mind does not consume me. It is not explaining how I feel to anyone because it is so much i would never get it all out anyways. It is becoming attached to one person and being so dependent on them even when I try not to be it is feeling lonely and trapped in my thoughts every time I am without them. It is wanting to be held every time I am sad because I am scared I will hurt myself. It is my awareness that my mind is the real problem constantly putting these thoughts in my head but not being able to prevent it. It is finally being willing to give up dreams and experiences like having children and buying my first house because I do not think I can live like this much longer. It is my worst fear. It is my depression. Depression and I,Depression

12716,12736,Hello guys I am not even sure if this is the right subreddit for this and sorry for my english in advance but i wanted to tell you how unusual I have felt since 2 days ago. Basically since I woke up on Tuesday I have been feeling numb like there is a fog in my brain and i lost interest for activities I normally do and really enjoy like watching movies.The weirdest thing about it is that I have irrational thoughts about it like literally 3 days ago i was watching old obscure essay films and literally the next day I found myself thinking what is the point of movies? they are fake those are actors and I cannot wrap my head around this.Added to the fact that I have constantly felt tired and sleepy I naturally thought about depression or anxiety but i have never had any of those things before in fact I am usually the cheerup guy in the family and usually find the silver lining even out of the most dark situations that have happened so it is being very sudden and unexplainable nothing has happened in my personal life lately either to justify this.I also thought it might be a side effect of Nasonex that is a corticosteroid nasal spray I have taken since the 8th of July and I have read it has some side effects but in the instructions it does not say anything about psychological effects so i kind of wrote it off. Then looking online I have read corticosteroids can actually produce anxiety or depression sometimes but it is very rare. So i basically do not know what to believe.Has anything like this happened to you before?Thanks in advance Weird symptoms for the past 2 days,Depression
12717,12737,I was asked Have you ever been surprised before? When people get hopeless they assume nothing will change for the better ever or that even if things change back and forth that it is destined to be a crap house forever. When I was asked this I blew it off as a half ass way to make people feel better but after thinking a long time you realize that nobody knows what things are going to happen in the future so I asked then what am I supposed to just deal with it until something may or may not happen to me? And he said people are not supposed to wait for changes to happen to them you are the only person controlling you so why wait to react off of someone else's life? It does not happen without effort and every single person can do it. do not doubt yourself and say well I have the worst position ever and nothing will change ever because then you would just be waiting around stalling your life away. I did just that until I realized that. The idea I was told.,Depression
12740,12760,Two of my friends just attempted suicide In the past two days and I was planning earlier on in the week but I stoped myself for some reason. anyway I just need some support I just need to talk,Depression
12742,12762,The last few months have been okay for me. I have gone to therapy and it is given me ways to cope with most of my depressive thoughts at least the ones caused by obvious thoughts process. Last night I had a dream that made me depressed. I remember running away from people all around me laughing at me as I just tried to get away from them so I could find a space to crawl into and curl up. Once I woke up this sense of worthlessness still stuck around but I could not find any of the thought processes that I know how to combat now. I just felt like an awful human for no reason.And then I imagined what it would be like if I was in a country with easy access to handguns and if I had one myself. It suddenly felt very easy to imagine myself loading it and holding it to my skull. The decision to pull the trigger feels like it would be so easy and yet I do not understand why. I am in a better place than I was last year. I feel fairly free and OK with life where as back then I was planning out the finer details of how to take my own life and yet that idea of dying still feels like the only way I am going to get away from these thoughts completely.Is that my reality now? Having to occasional fight the urge to end it all for no particular reason? Why does the decision to end it feel so easy?,Depression
12745,12765,I honestly do not know what to do anymore. I joined the Army back last year and shipped out for basic last month. I was pretty happy at the time since I just graduated HS and was making my parents proud following in their footsteps. Now not even 2 months in I am back home on con leave for a hip and knee injury and I just do not think I can mentally handle going back to Georgia. I have lost all my motivation. It just sucked being there in Red Phase. Sleep deprived Hungry Constantly getting screamed atsmoked for minor mistakes. does not sound like much but when you combine it all together it sucks. I tried to power through but got injured the last week of Red Phase. Now I am getting recycled and being placed with a platoon freshly starting. I am honestly contemplating suicide. I am just sick of living at this point. I doubt things will get better for me. Joined the Army and feel Suicidal.,Depression

Ever since he got diagnosed with bipolar disorder he depended so much on that.I want to help him but how can I help him when I am suffering like him? How do i make him stay even though he does not see a point in living? How do I make him stay when he refuses to ask for help because its just people telling you your life matters?Please help me. He will not get help. He refuses to share to any people his problems. He gets jealous when people are there for someone but not him even though he will not tell anyone.

12956,12976,Hi I have struggled with major depression through my life it has been complex and I have been hospitalised a few times in the past. In general I am happy with the medical treatment I have had and how well I have done to manage my health but I will always have depression it is not going away.Right now I am really struggling with tasks. I am an adult child carer for a disabled pareny and life will not stop just because I am struggling. I just really need to smash through these tasks on my list and get them done on top of dealing with the daily issues that seem to constantly come up. These are longstanding tasks and I know that once I get them done I will feel that there is a weight off my shoulders.I often need to drop everything at no notice to attend to my parents needs because if I do not the situation will explode into a meltdown. But after I deal with parent's issue whatever it may be I feel so drained.I struggle to concentrate and focus on what I need to get done and on my motivations for doing it feel overwhelmed with apathy.How do you pace yourself and keep making yourself perform to productively achieve work tasks on your to do list at times when you are struggling but things just need to get done? I am feeling so frustrated.Cheers Seeking productivity tips dealing with poor concentration and motivation,Depression

13092,13112,Worked with a councillor for a while who really helped me with gaining tools to stop my negative thoughts. I have slipped back into them and using these tools is harder now since they do not feel believable. I worked on affirmations breaking down negative thoughts roots of low self esteem and positive qualities with her. When I try to go through them now I just do not believe the positive conclusions I am supposed to make by the end or I get caught up in my documented negative thoughts. Only affirmations seems to work or are believable when I am very depressed. How to make psychotherapy believable?,Depression
13130,13150,tw eating disorder? not sure if it is or if the tw is needed but just in caseI think this will be all over the place as I am still not sure if it makes sense and am just wrapping my head around it but I will try. Okay so I always loved eating it was a big source of comfort and joy ever since I was a kid 20s now. When I was 18 or 19 when I started college and started spending more time with my peers as I moved into a new city I started realizing that I might have an unhealthy relationship with food as I was binge eating on the daily basis and just started seeing that people around me do not consume the food the way I do like for example they would stop eating when full. By that point I had always just assumed that everyone ate enormous quantities of food and that it is normal for food to play such a crucial role in ones life.I was also and still am heavily depressed throughout all these years and around the time the first lockdowns were happening last year early 2020 I realized I was getting high so I can eat moreopen up my apatite. I know that it probably started way earlier I started smoking when I was a freshmen in HS but that is the first time I noticed the direct link. I mostly eat junk food such as hamburgers chips ice cream basically all the crap you can think of. At some point I ate melted chocolate and canned cream for breakfast. I am pretty sure I gained 60 or 65lbs since I left my hometown which then in return directly makes my depression even worse. So I have been feeling like I am trapped in a vicious cycle for a while now.A couple of months ago I started having days sometimes multiple in a row where I would not eat at all or crave any food. I would just feel nauseous by the mere thought of eating anything. There are still days when I binge eat but I feel disgusted and nauseous by the food and the act itself while it is happening whereas before I enjoyed it. Even when I am having a regularsized meal I sometimes feel disgusted. I was walking around the supermarket today and realized I had not eaten anything in 2 days and that I have no cravings whatsoever. So I do not know where to go from here? Is this a good thing that I am disgusted by binge eating I still do it tho? Is the feeling of nausea coming from the junk food or is this an eating problem or am I just getting older and not being able to eat as much as I used to and the crap I used to? I know the obvious answer is seek professional help but I would like to hear any thoughts or advice that you might have as I am not even sure what is happening.To anyone that has taken their time to read this thank you I am disgusted by food,Depression
13136,13156,Fuck me. I have a lot of anger in me. I am not at that point where I hate women and think I am owed sex but still. Being a virgin really. I want to rip my ugly ass face off and drop kick anyone who says no one is ugly. Bull shit. I have been ugly my whole life and you fucks invalidate me I have been a social reject and undesirable af. I used to not be this angry. I usually am just a calm quiet guy. But christ it pisses me off how ugly and undesirable I am. Depression takes my soul and spits it out. Many days I often want to just go hang myself or kill myself. I am so fucking done with life. All the self improvement never pays off. I do not even feel human. Thinking about suicide gives me pleasure. More pleasure than pleasuring myself. FML Suicidal over being ugly virgin depressed undesirable,Depression
13152,13172,pretty much the title life is garbage. I do not see the meaning or worth sorry. I cannot to do this anymore. I am almost 21 and all my life I have been judged and treated like shit. I have been isolated and isolated myself for three years after highschool. So now I am 20 and I do not know what to do with my life. I wish I had more responsible parents who cared about me and the fact the I was being judged and bullied in school and did something about it. And I wish they took me to therapy before and not just nowwhen my life is almost ruined. If they did care at least a lil bit before and took me to the terapist I would have been better by now. And have my life in order and be okay. But now I am wayyy far into depression and do not know what to do more than going to the terapist and get better for now. But fuck I feel old as fuck and like my life is ruined and I have no salvation. Shit,Depression
13166,13186,Background I have suffered from bouts of depression for most of my life I am 27 now plus anxiety to varying extents and Autism Spectrum Disorder as well...I take meds for impulse control and depression management and have done so more or less steadily since early 2013 with usually pretty steady positive results and only occasional ups and downsRecently though I have been feeling very unsettled by the fluctuations in my mood and daytoday or hourtohour sense of wellbeing...I started a new job early last month and have enjoyed it thus far but another facet of my situation is that I feel as if I cannot connect to my peers no matter how much I want to And believe me I do...it is like the main thing I am lacking is healthy human connection but the number one thing I am recoiling against as my brain seemingly tries to jump on a sword is healthy human connectionToday was particularly hellish... at times I felt totally normal sociable and human while at others I felt varyingly like ripping the world's throat out with my teeth or jumping off a cliff into oblivionOne thing that really set me off was the realization that I had more work to do when I thought I was actually done for the day...something that set me off enough to become openly testy around coworkers and to become violent towards myself on the way home in the form of pounding the heel of my hand on the hard plastic top of my car's console and listening to metal music at the stereo's max volumeDoes anyone have any suggestions for things I can do in the shortterm to prevent further or god forbid worsening outbursts and the seeming descent of my mind into dark places? Please amp thank you What is wrong with me? Genuinely concerned my medicine is not working andor my mental health may be deteriorating,Depression
13167,13187,a vent I suppose My age range is 1825. I am still 'young'. I was always a person who felt young at heart even 3 years into depression because I liked childish things like cartoons and toys and sweets. But something happened last year and I stopped feeling that way and lost love for those things. Now I feel no longer like a young person but old and tired. I am tired all the time and fed up with the world. I want to disengage from it already isolated myself from most my friends. Before I felt isolated from my age group because I was too childish but now I feel isolated because I feel too old for all this. I feel like my life is nearing its end and I do not want to go on. I just go day to day without doing much at all because things do not excite me like they used to. Sometimes I look in the mirror and check if I am growing wrinkles or white hair because I wonder if my outside will reflect my inside. Why do I feel old? Did something happen to my psychology? Before I felt like a sad child inside but now I feel like an old man waiting to die. Why did I miss the middle stage of growing up? I know happy old people exist but I just feel done pessimistic and tired. Still 'young' but feel 'old',Depression
13173,13193,let us take a vote. Should I kill myself?,Depression
13175,13195,i took a shower last night and shaved my legs for the first time in 56 months i feel very proud i took care of myself yay,Depression
13198,13218,not a single person not my family not my boyfriend not my friends no one I do not feel loved by anyone,Depression
13199,13219,Why is everything so confusing? Why do i want to kms although life is going unexpectedly well?? Why am i even here. Why am i writing this..i just want to be in peace and not feel anything. I just want everything to end.. Everything is going fine but i still want to end it all,Depression
13236,13256,I do not really have much to say there is plenty to say I just do not know how to word it I really just need to know why nothing ever goes my way I woke up this morning and finally got the new face products my girlfriend and I ordered online I said we should test them all out and she agreed yeah well long story short I got out of the shower and an hour later was dumped she was packing her stuff telling me to take her to down to her sisters all because of a petty argument she started days earlier that she brought back up not only that but the argument was only started because she kept talking over me and got pissed off when I got pissed off from her constantly doing it.I have got no one in my life I never have really it is always been me and only me I have got 4 months to find a job then move out of my parents house but unfortunately I am a 22 year old with 21 to my name and thanks to covid it is now impossible for me to even get a job. Not that is was possible before because of the fact that I am a young person with Supervisor and management experience within a large company however even with that it does not count for anything because I apply for jobs lower than what I am qualified for but to employers I am too qualified for that position or I am not qualified enough when I apply for jobs I am qualified for due to being young on top of that goodluck to me in finding a job that will even pay enough to survive on.I truly do not understand what I did wrong I am not a bad person I have tried so hard to help everyone I can and yet no one is ever there for me this is all just a small brush over for some of my problems I guess after all I had a bit to say.Thank you to however takes the time to read this and I apologise for any grammartical errors I suppose I just want someone to know a little bit because it just helps to believe that. I just do not know what to do anymore,Depression
13277,13297,Ever since I was a little kid I grew up thinking I was inferior. The culture I was raised in was very colorist and restrictive and the fact my skin tone was on the darker side made me subject to all kinds of insecurity. I was indirectly programmed to believe I was not enough and that I was unattractive. My family emigrated and I grew up in a country in which I am a minority. This made it even worse. I already expected people to treat me like shit and I would not speak to people because I was almost certain that they would want nothing to do with me. Now when I look in the mirror or when somebody takes a picture of me my entire moodday is ruined. I feel sick and disgusted to the core. Society is incredibly hard wired to evaluate the worth of a person just by the way they look which I guess then makes me a nobody. I have boundless unconditional self hatred. I could not hate any entity in the universe more than I despise myself. My self hatred just continues to perpetuate itself. Everywhere I go I see beautiful perfect faces. Every time I check my phone. Every time I turn on the TV. Every time I go for a walk outside. I feel so disgusting and hideous compared to everybody else. I am unable to see myself in any other way. I feel as if I am undeserving of love affection friendship. I deserve nothing. When I see a pretty girl I do not think about how pretty she is but how disgusted she would be to know that a guy like me found her attractive. I isolate myself from friends and family. I sometimes ask my friends why they even want to speak to me. I want to be attractive. I want to feel confident. I want to be loved. I want to have a family and raise children and be successful. I want to be somebody else somebody who is not me. I just want to be happy. And I never will be. Self esteem is destroying my life rant,Depression
13278,13298,I appreciate you for having a big heart when help is needed. Even if it is the littlest thing possible you were there. I love you for being real with yourself. It may not be pleasant but you fought through it hard.Somewhere someone in this world is still mending their very own broken heart. It could be you. But best believe another broken soul is actually yearning to be loved by you. they are patiently keeping their big heart for you too. It might not happen instantly but always have faith. This post may not be seen by many and it will be fine. I am paying forward my hope for you to be as good as you have been trying to. Keep on going my dear stranger.I love you from the other side of the earth. I love you,Depression
13279,13299,Lately I have probably been at the deepest point in my life. It feels like I will never be able to get out of this dark position anymore. And then I usually start to think about some things. People say life is hard and it are not all rainbows and sunshines. But I wonder do I really have to experience all this pain? Do I have to go through this in order to live a valid life? Is life really this painful? Does everyone get tested like this? did not I really live if I could not handle the pain anymore? Is this really what living consists of? Because in that case life really sucks. Do I have to go through all this pain?,Depression
13289,13309,like the title says I am being faced with many questions regarding my future. I am so indecisive and have no idea what i want out of life. I am going to college in august and idk what to major in. all of this has sent me spiraling into research online for what jobs might interest me.. this has caused me to fall into a depression. i cannot stop thinking about how meaningless this is all is. how unimportant money is in the big picture. I am feeling discouraged because i have no passion for a job. and I am starting to fall into a little existential crisis about life and capitalism and our society nowadays and how we all just mindlessly work a 95 no joy etc. I am feeling scared and hopeless for the future. i feel like there is no point. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety and on meds but I have been doing so good recently until now. all this talk about the future has sent me into a dark depression. how do i stop obsessing ? thank you being faced with so many questions of what careermajor in choosing thoughts of the future is making me depressed,Depression
13308,13328,Thinking that everything is useless because things will not get better for you you do not deserve anything because you are not enough you are not good looking not talented not appealing not worthy and so on...so you stop doing everything and you just wait for the time to pass...sorry for my english The worse feeling of depression is hopelessness... 23f,Depression

13374,13394,Have you guys seen the news recently. does not look like the futures going to be good. Time to call it quits? Everyday the world is looking worse. what is the point anymore,Depression
13377,13397,To start I am here because of relationship anxiety. I had posted recently about having immense anxiety about a girl I barely knew. Awesome girl. Very grounded very sweet. But for some odd reason chemistry somewhere down the way I had become infatuated rather quick. And then a certain unease crept in that felt like I was screwing up somewhere. within moments I automatically jumped to very negative affirmations that swirled in my head day and night for the past two weeks. The ones that stick out you are going to fuck this up you are not normal she will find out your issues and dip from yo crazy ass!!Somewhere down the way I deeply pondered at the last part. Life looking back was rather well....Childhood!!I had parents who had issues in their relationship on their own let own their own individual demons. I acknowledge that they always did their best to make sure we were fed and had a roof over our heads. But a lot of things I felt I had to teach myself on my own. In the beginning life was okay but after awhile it got tough for my parents way back. and certain choices were made then that led to exodus from Hawaii to the mainland. Things were the best we could make but they were not ideal. At some point in time we slept in a car as a family.We never stayed in one place for longer than a year. always constantly moving since I was a kid it practically never ended until I had gotten a place of my own. It did not with my parents anger issues mother's narcissism and my father's drinking and abuse. Still through it all they stuck it out for us but I wonder sometimes if that was a good idea...When both of my younger siblings were diagnosed with autism both of my parents had gotten distant from me it felt. I completely understand and a lot of it I give myself shit for it. But also my younger siblings have been sheltered too much as well. It was hard then as a kid to tell them that there was a difference between compromising and spoiling. We gave them no structure or guidance. After awhile I was left with most of responsibilities of watching and raising my younger siblings which are the memories I enjoy most in my life. Looking back now it was not all bad.The level of abuse between my parents ruined a lot of opportunities for us. Always hurting themselves us our possessions fighting relocating separating getting back together again rinse and repeat. Lived through toxic before I knew what that meant. Ran away for the first time when I was 11 and went across the county almost. It became clockwork. because of the constant moving I could never maintain friendships. And on top of that I was scared to bring friends around. To some degree it got to a point where we filed a false domestic violence report on my father He actually was getting his shit together at the time to get into a farm program and avoid sleeping on the street. Also a good time learned Martial arts did gardening. Another good time.Parents had gotten back together at some point in time before High School. Life was good for a bit stable. Then the issues arose. I was having issues with my parents then and went out and hung out with the wrong crowd was partying and drinking all the time even skipping school. I graduated but barely. My graduation on the other hand was finding out my mother was gambling addict and also was in part to ruining a lot of our prospects in life.I do not want to hold onto any of this against my parents. Now they are still trying their best to survive and they have changed over the years. But lately this surfaced too and I have not felt well when I talked to my mother about this. She did not know what to say and I began to be frustrated about it but I realize now that she was not prepared to handle the issues I was going through and she was trying her best. Its still upsetting when she does not remember anything she has done wrong. But I need to move on I love my mother and I only have one. No matter how batshit crazy she is.I love my dad we are okay we hang out have lunch every once in awhile and he is conscious of his actions. But he still has a lot of work to do. But I am proud of how far he is come. I love you Dad.Adulthood!!! the super condensed versionRight after graduation was a shitshow. Lost the place me and pops split. ended up in a shelter for a year and a half. Dad came here from a different country under extreme circumstances I do not want to get into but frankly he was prepared for life as much as I was. Went to community college while homeless. Got an apartment with other guys my age from the shelter. Then realized alcoholism was genetic. Fucked off my responsibilities. Split. Went upstate to stay with my mother. At the time I realized she was up to same tricks which led to a lot of fights between us and eventually she stole from me and kicked me out. stayed with a girl next door first relationship then left me for the father of her baby I was still fucking off my responsibilities then and subsequently back on the street.moved around from place to place. Met another girl fell in love but she had major depressive disorder and schizo. after a year the relationship took a turn for the worst. She began to be emotionally abusive and always kicked me out. I did my best but at the end of the day we have come to terms that she never actually loved me. She went into another relationship a couple weeks later. But I fell hard.Interesting part COVIDI moved back the other side of the state to stay with my dad. The place he had for me was a clean and sober house ran by a slumlord. Then COVID hit the states. I was quarantined in a horrible place post breakup living with my dad who was emotionally abusive. I could not handle it. I got my shit together got a job at the hospital and got my own apartment!!!NOW....Been doing everything I needed to. Kept up with bills work out every day eating healthy drinking less. Then I met this girl. Same birthday independent very grounded. And now everything came back. Now my anxiety is becoming debilitating in certain areas. I am becoming more irritable although a lot of that is from the shortcomings of the healthcare industry. But if this is going to become a thing I need in dealing with this anxious attachment style. I have pushed away my remaining friends because of my last relationship and I am starting to push everyone else away right now. Either way if you made this far thanks for taking the time. I know I am better than this and I know I can be better than this. I just wish I did not mess this up with her just to learn. Frankly I just wish things like this did not happen just for a learning lesson. Feels like the purpose of my life is just to be an example. do not be like this guy. I just want to be happy and honest. I try to do the right thing in anything I do and I try to help people as much as I can. But why I cannot be happy or trust other people? Why cannot I just be happy?Wishing I could time travel now.....ampx200BTry your best because everything else is easy. Always do the right thing. Goodwill will always be paid forward. Finding closure in my crazy life To pursue true happiness within myself,Depression

13401,13421,I do not hate being alive. I just hate living. I feel like I cannot do anything right no matter how hard I try. I tend to mess something up in one way or another and I am just trying to survive. I drive my car trying to get from one point to another in a rural area with no public transportations my car breaks.I drive my dads truck and it rains living in a hilly spot the traction control comes on and now the tires smell and have a white smoke coming from them even after the traction control disengaged.I had to grocery shop and I was just trying to get the usual. I got pickles and then putting them in the truck something broke so now there pickle juice all over a 50lb bag of salts that is for our cows. Of course the bag was paper so the juice leaked through. And of course trying to get the giant box of cat little out of this truck I am not used to I smacked my lip and busted it open. These were just my blunders from this morning. The list goes onIm just tired of doing stuff. Everything I do something bad things keeps happening and I am tired of feeling like a burden I waste money I break stuff. And all I am trying to do is live with the same knowledge that was given to my peers. I wish I could just some doing thing and making decisions and have everything done for me. Then I could do nothing wrong. Fuck my lip hurts. I hate having to live.,Depression
13414,13434,At the age of 23 I am a 57 male. My dad is taller than me and my younger brothers are taller than me at 510 and 59. Everywhere I look on the internet or even just regular conversations people seem to be OBSESSED with height. Any short male is deemed as a joke these days and I cannot take it anymore.I do not even like standing up because I am reminded of my height. I do not look in a mirror because of how ugly and short I am. A reminder that men will always look down on me thinking they can beat me up and if I were to magically get a girlfriend her friends and family will always remark on how she could do better.I do not see the point in continuing on. The only way a short guy like me can find some sort of happiness in this world is by being very rich. Otherwise no matter how hard I work no matter how social I am Ill always be 57. Ill always be a joke and a last option for women.Once I move out I plan on dying. I cannot live in this height obsessed society anymore. Too ashamed to stand up or look in a mirror.,Depression
13418,13438,The love of my life left me months ago directly after a suicide attempt and she took all our friends with her. they have been ghosting me or giving me bullshit excuses to not see me since. I have multiple serious mental illnesses that are basically incurable I have never held down a job for longer than a year I have goals but I fully expect to fail and be worse off because nothing ever gets better for me. I am supposed to start school soon but I know Ill fuck that up too and that is my last option. I just want to love and be loved but the person I trusted most in my life up and left when I needed her most so how could I ever trust again? Sorry for rambling I do not even know what the fuck I am doing I feel like I am already dead,Depression
13420,13440,I have been diagnosed with depression since 2019 after a panic attack left me unemployed. I started taking meds straight away. At the beginning of this year I was finally moved to the lowest Prozac prescription as I was deemed stable.I was very happy to move to a lower dosage as I could not think clearly and focus when I was on the heavier meds. I thought I could finally get back to working. However it did not work out as I expected.I started with a high volume of job applications but over time they dropped to none. This might due to fear anxiety or disappointment.Lately I only accomplish a maximum of 10 of any task or goal I set.As of today I am feeling hopeless and helpless. I am starting to doubt my worth and competence. This week I gave up. I will no longer put effort into anything period. I am on day four without cleaning and showering. Unlike before I do not feel guilty this time. I have accepted. Light at the end of the tunnel burns out,Depression
13426,13446,In the last few years my life completely fell apart my health went to shit so did my career prospects I am 33 and even though I did well in college and got into grad school I could not make it in grad school now I am back home living with my parents like a loser. Every time I try to pull myself up my health gets worse. I take a step forward and get knocked back 2. I am very close to just being done with it all. I hate reminding myself that unless I am done living then I have to keep trying.,Depression
13436,13456,I am a 22 yo with a history of severe depression including suicide attempts. I got those when I was around 18 and seeked medical support and I thought I was getting better. I found my will to live and tried to live a good life. But my father passed away suddenly and I kept having existential crises and now I do not see any point of living anymore. Few years back I used to cut my arms and thighs whenever I wanted to distract my pain to somewhere physical and now I do not even feel like doing anymore and its a lot more scarier. Every person in my life know me as this super happy person with no issue at all and I hate to burst their bubble by sharing my story with them. And I am at a point where I do not want anyone in my family to know that I am leading this double life and therefore I cannot get a professional to help me. I am at that point where nothing even hurts me anymore not even the thought of my loved ones missing me when I am gone. I do not want to kill myself but it would be great if I could just not exist anymore. Please. Help me. A cry for help,Depression
13440,13460,Hi 4 years ago i made a long time therapy 48 hours i guess. It did not help. I have only one thing i want to talk about which happed in the past but i cannot find Therapy due to covid now i would have to wait 15 years anyone can help? No more therapy?,Depression
13448,13468,I was diagnosed with depression a long while ago with that term chemical imbalance thrown around a lot too. I only really experienced exactly what this meant this summer.While trying to make some life improvements I had decided to try multivitamins as my diet has been lacking for a long while on account of not being able to afford better meals or many of them often i was having only one meal a day of either a microwave meal or noodles. After taking the multivitamins I experienced a severe wave of depression more intense than when i had first been diagnosed. I am wondering if anyone else has ever had a similar experience or can advise me of anything on how to avoid reoccurrences or further complications in the future. PS I stopped taking the vitamins immediately after feeling this way. It took around 3 days to kick in but nearly 2 weeks to wear off. What is chemical imbalance depression?,Depression
13455,13475,Last year was the low point of my life. My wife left me I had gained a massive amount of weight my sleep schedule was completely out of whack I was extremely depressed constantly felt weak never wanted to leave the house etc. Also worth noting I have been balding since highschool and my sex drive was at an all time low.Needless to say I saw another post on reddit someone with low T levels describing their symptoms and it was like reading an autobiography. I went to my doctor and sure enough my testosterones was at ground levels. The doctor got me set up on testosterones therapy and the results have been life changing.Since then I have effortlessly lost weight I am in a waaaaaaaaay better mental state my sex drive is through the roof I am hitting the gym something I thought I would never say and I am even dating again.Seriously if any of these symptoms describe you go see your doctor. it is way more common than people realize and nothing to be ashamed of. Getting my testosterone levels checked saved my life. 27M,Depression
13457,13477,I feel like a horrible person and want to die is there anyone who wants to just talk that is 20 Someone to talk to,Depression
13459,13479,Hi rDepressionLet me introduce myself. I am a 26 years old guy and I have been dealing with minor depression since I was about 18 years old. I have been into therapy about two years ago and within two weeks I am starting it up again because things have been going downhill lately. I need a new job I need to move somewhere else I need some fucking love but I am just fucking stuck. People always tell me it will get better but how long is it going to take? I would love to believe it but it takes a lot of fucking time. I am not suicidal or anything thank god but I have done stupid shit like driving really fast at night on an empty road and turning off the lights and just blast into oblivion. Deep down inside I know it is a scream for attention or an urge to feel a kind of peculiar 'romantic' feeling. And it never lasts for more than three to five seconds before you snap out of it. Anyways that is not supposed to be me. I am still at the same place where I was a couple of years ago. Looking back things have not improved that much despite hard fucking work. So what do I fucking do? I hope I get lucky one day in the future but it has not happened yet. All my friends get lucky... The whole ordeal is not theendoftheworldbad but it just sucks so much. I really do not know what to do. Luckily I do have very happy days! Days where I feel me again a confident smart and handsome guy. But on days like these it just eats up everything. Is there any short term solution to get things going again? do not tell me to read a book or to go play the guitar do something I like because that is only possible if my mind is in the right place. The only thing that would help is I think a miracle. Where are my miracles? Like suddenly being able to move on because of sheer coincidence because you found someone or something you love. It happens to the people I know. Well not me. I was given the option of taking citalopram by my general practitioner and I thought about it but I will not take it. For three reasons 1 They do not work on everyone 2 If one is to take them it must be for a long period of time 3 I do not want to get dependent. I might take them in the future but let us first see my psychologist.Perhaps I can talk a little with you in here ask me questions or anything because I am not able to really pinpoint everything. there is pages and pages of feelings in what I mentioned above but I just cannot paint the whole picture. What the absolute fuck do I do right now? Depressed need some help. Or better a miracle. I just want to talk...,Depression
13536,13556,Been dealing with depression for a few years and although I have gotten better when comparing myself now and me from a couple years ago I still feel hopeless about myself.Had a long term relationship that ended two years ago and I still suffer about it daily. I feel like I will end alone.Got no clue about what path to take professionally and even though I am working it is outside my field and I am absolutely exhausted with the second university course I am doing currently.I just feel like whatever I do and no matter how hard I try it is never enough. Not enough to get over my ex not enough to find someone nice and actually trust people again not enough to find myself professionally and not enough to get myself better away from the pit of dispair that I was back then.I know I am a bit better but I am exhausted and frustrated. do not know how to feel at peace anymore and it does not feel like it will charge any time soon. I know a new relationship is not the answer for my problems but damn I miss not feeling alone I miss taking care of someone and feeling cared for.I am just rambling at this point but those are the feelings I have every day and no matter how hard I try to see things differently and to reinvent myself it never seems like it is enough. Feeling hopeless and could use some advice,Depression
13565,13585,Used to want to soar through the sky like a bird and see everything cool and stuff. Now I just want to go real high and dive down straight into the ground. Maybe I will go skydiving one day. always wanted to fly but nowadays it is for far different reasons,Depression
13608,13628,Its mildly heartbreaking every time I am invited to an event and I check if my friends are going and they say yes coz it mean that they were going regardless of whether i was and also means that didny think to ask me if i was going. Especially since I am 90 sure they would have asked at least one of their friends to decide whether they want to go or notJust a lil rant Never the first,Depression
13669,13689,I am 15f not a native english speaker never went to therapy and I do not have the courage to ask my parents not bc they are bad or smth like that but bc I do not feel like opening up about why I would want to do it. My life is pretty good I have almost nothing to complain about. But this year I have been feeling super stressed about school and entrance exams I just hate studying but I do it bc I have to my grades are very good but I still feel guilty for not wanting to go to college only to study more and work after. I do not have a career I want to follow and it worries me like what the hell am I going to do?. I have been having existencial crisis regularly and it tightens my chest everytime I think about how I dislike life in itself and the whole pain of being alive.I do not do the things I liked before I cannot find motivation do to anything anymore. I pass my days on my phone sometimes studying or chatting with my parents. it is kind of boring. I do not feel sad all the time but I feel empty. I laugh and I can be happy about good things that happen to me but modt times I am just existing. When I think about my future I am not hopeful I do not want to study or work. I want to be nothing I often think it would be better if I did not exist and that I do not have many motives to continue living tho I do not plan on self harming. I am on vacation from school but I am sleeping very late 2am3am and I feel guilty about that too I wish I could be motivated to wake up and be productive.I feel like a failure these days. I am not as cool and funny as before I am not as smart as before. And I am too dependant on my parents I cannot cook or do a complete housecleaning for example. I do not know how to live independently I will be an adult in 2 years but I cannot do anything by myself my parents also said that to me. I am living my life on autopilot I need people telling me what to do. I feel like I am lazy sometimes I do not eat bc making like simple sandwich seems too much work.I am crying even more recently bc idk what to do. My mind is a confusing mix of you are depressed and stop wanting to have a mental illness just bc you think it is cool. I feel like a bad sister bc I am too rude to my little sister I do not show much affection towards her and I do not play with her that much I feel so guilty about it but I cannot help it when I see I already did all these things. And a bad daughter bc I do not help my mother at chores as much as she needs. I am so tired of living with regrets I regret that I was not a bettet person every single day. I cannot seem to change myself.Sorry about my rant I hope I can find good advice here. You can ask me anything if you need more info. Am I depressed?,Depression
13707,13727,So I was diagnosed with major depression and severe anxiety. My father decided to send me to his hometown where I would be cured. He thought I just needed a company and new environment. Because I have been living alone for almost three years. At first I just had severe anxiety which pandemic caused me. But because of the repeated lockdown I literally could not go outside and I felt like I was a prisoner. And eventually I got worse and developed major depression.So fast forward. Now I am at my father's family house. At first it was really hard for me to settle but later I gradually managed to adjust. But then my aunt started sleeping in my room. I really do not want it. I am not comfortable. I do not like it when there are other people in my room. I want to be alone. I can deal with people outside but inside my room I want it to be just my own space. Although everything my aunt does is just sleep here she really does not bother me but I feel like my privacy has been invaded. I am not really comfortable. I cannot sleep despite taking sleeping pills. I am hallucinating that there is someone next to me which there is really is because I forgot my aunt also sleeps here as I used to live alone. And now she changed the set up of my room. That really made me burst into tears. it is frustrating. You know having these disorders its always hard to find to be comfortable. it is hard to adjust.What really distressing me is that I could not tell them. I cannot tell them this and that depressed me. I cannot tell them I am really not well. That my body is suffering. I cannot tell them I do not like this or that. I do not want them to offend. I do not want them to think I am making an attitude. I do not want them to get angry. But its hard. I am struggling. it is really frustrating. My body starts to act up again. What to do? How to say No?,Depression
13711,13731,This is going to be my senior year and I see all these classmates hanging out and having fun. I wish I had that. I reminisce of the times I was able to do that with my friend group in middle school. And I cry thinking about how Ill never experience it ever again. We were close but of course friendships fade especially when you go to different highschools but we still hung out every now and then but now I know we will not. I do not think any of us have reentered such a tight knit friend group like we had before and since our friends passing we just realized we would never be that tight knit group anymore. I wish I had that support system I hate feeling lonely now. I see classmates posting about them going bowling and playing at Dave and busters. I hate them I hate that I cannot have what they have I hate my life. I have contemplated suicide before but I have never acted upon it today is the first day that i selfed harmed. I do not think Ill ever fit in to a new group I do not think Ill ever be happy again. I do not think Ill ever be happy,Depression
13761,13781,I have a small penis no friends my gf cheated on me told me I was not a man and tried to peg me because my penis was so small I failed in College and have no job prospects I will be living at home with my hyper religious parents who are embarrassed of me. I used to be in shape but my depression and anxiety is taking a toll. I also have like 450 mg of test at most. I am a skinny fat guy. I have tiny balls too so I probably cannot have kids so that is good.I am a joke I managed to get a new girl but my ex gave me chlamydia after all the sex she had and made it worse. All women are repulsed by me. Yeah I am throwing a pity party but luckily for me I am the only one invited.I have never had friends. I think my only friends are porn and Youtube.Honestly if your reading this just know you have a better life than me and will be a lot happier. Just know you are not me and nothing in your life can be going bad. I went to a private school for college so just with my bachelors I will be almost 200k in debt.I am in an apartment but I will eventually just be a loser in my parents basement who wanted to be a doctor.Yeah but while I am going to be a lonely unsuccessful loser. Also do not feel bad for me I have been fucked up and done so many fucked up things hell I have been to the mental house twice. Well I hate myself. But just read this and think about the pathetic smelly uglyI am so ugly they told me not to smile in my college photo and I had professional photos taken and the photographer literally got made because of how ugly I am. you are life is going great you are not a pathetic loser like me.Yep. .,Depression
13774,13794,I am tired. I am 27. I have been struggling all my life. I cannot get over childhood abuse I was tortured by parents specially mother and I mean physical abuse until I was like 15. Add the psychological abuse not feeding me stunting my growth constant threats from crazy mother.I have this disease in my head. I am too tired. Drugs and alcohol is the only comfort. And the permanent suicidal conduct will not go away. I have survived two well planned attempts and countless drug overdoses. Too fucking traumatic to me. I cry a lot and I am a man. Being depressed and suicidal chronically,Depression
13796,13816,all i do is trigger myself. I have been doing my best to be happy and enjoy life but its really hard after knowing how much its been fucked up. its almost impossible to get used to change even if its a good change. and oh missing someone is the actual worst. its kind of annoying how someone can because you so much pain but yet you still miss them like crazy. knowing that you are never going to speak to them again after spending so much time together. fml. i hate my ex girlfriend. i hate her but no matter what ill always love her. why did we have to meet why did this have to happen. i cannot with this shit,Depression
13870,13890,I cannot turn to anyone not to freinds and family not therapy I doubt even here anyone would be able to relate to my years of struggle even those like me seem to shun me or not be able to relate to me I am alone and there is noting I can do I am utterly alone with my problems,Depression
13912,13932,I finally got health insurance for the first time in my life but the copay for therapy is still 50. Which sadly I cannot afford right now I am getting by paycheck to paycheck. Are there other options that you all know of? I have insurance but still cannot afford the 50 copay for therapy. Are there any other options?,Depression
13936,13956,I just do not have it in me to care about people anymore. It takes to much work to love or hate. And for the most part people either do not care about me or have lied to me about caring. I use the firing squad test. If you tell me you love me what are the odds you would chose to take my place at the bullet end of a firing squad? If the odds of that happening are laughably low then you do not love me. You sort of care about me. I have learned over the last few years that this is what almost every person who said they loved me actually meant.So I too chose indifference. Humans are humans as other animals are other animals. I do not have the energy to care anymore. Let them play their stupid games. It is only if they get in my way that I will indifferently do what I need to do to enact my will. The only law is what I can get away with. I will forever be alone but that is a small price to pay. It beats the alternative. Trust me I am 46 divorced and no longer speaking with the man I once called father. I know what I am talking about. The Age of Indifference,Depression
13941,13961,Since I was born I have never had an interest for a career. Teachers or whatever always asked kids what they wanted to do when they grew up and it seemed like everyone always had an answer but me. I have never been able to respond to that question with anything but I do not know. Now I am almost 22 with no job and crippling social anxiety that I have had since I can remember making it extremely difficult to just go get a job. My social anxiety makes everything outside of my house feel like a painful chore and I just do not have the energy to constantly push through that day after day after day hour by hour.The only interest I have that has any potential to be a career is making music but I have lost nearly all passion for that over the past year even after making some good stuff. Every once in a while I get a little fire to sit down and make something but that is quickly extinguished when I realize I cannot make anything good anymore. It all just feels robotic now. I just do not see how I can have a life when nothing interests me or feels reachable.I do not know what the point of this post is I am pretty much just ranting because reality is hitting me again. No desire or motivation to do anything.,Depression
13957,13977,I am a 26 F and I feel like I am completely useless. I literally do not have a use in this world anymore. I tried pulling myself together but nothing. I applied for an easy job I used to have but today I was rejected for it. I left because I could not cope with writing while I was feeling so fucked up. I thought I was doing the right thing by quiting my job to focus on me but seemingly all I did was lose a job. I have been applying for work but nothing. I have zero talents or skills. I just do not have a place in this world it seems. Fuck. I feel so useless,Depression
13960,13980,Thinking about throwing my life away. Ruining relationships losing my job then I will not have anything left and will make it easier to kill myself Thinking about throwing it all away,Depression
13965,13985,Moved out of state with my boyfriend and I am seriously struggling.I am uninsured and off my meds had a job with benefits lined up but because of a situation out of my control I did not get the job. Basically got discriminated against in the preemployment physical. Furious.Only just now got a license in this state so I can get a marketplace plan that probably will not cover the treatment I need. But I stopped 4 different meds without the guidance of a doctor because I had no choice.The job I ended up taking is scheduling me every weekend Saturday AND Sunday so now I have no shared days off with my boyfriend. I have no friends here so now I spend my days off alone.I used to have hobbies I was perfectly content alone but now I do not enjoy anything enough for it to be worth the effort. Everything is too hard.I spend my lonely days off mindlessly scrolling social media. I am bored to death but I do not WANT to do anything.. nothing is appealing.I hate working I hate these days off alone I hate everything. I was so excited for a new start but life is just kicking me in the face repeatedly. I am so angry and defeated. Just moved and struggling,Depression
13984,14004,Hello I would call myself as depression survivor because I have survived a few nearly successful suicide attempts. After some time I have thought myself how to live with depression but I cannot get rid of the option in my head to kill myself whenever something happens. That option is 247 in my head and even though I consider myself as happy person now sometimes I still think about it. My question is how can I force myself to not see it as an option. It currently is the biggest obstacle I have to face and I would like some advice from anyone that has similar experience.DISCLAIMER!I have no intent in killing myself. I have learned to not listen to those thoughts. They still remain in my head and I seek any not only professional advice in how to at least reduce those thoughts ideally to get rid of them.Thank you in advance for any suggestions or advice. How to deal with suicidal thoughts?,Depression
13987,14007,I try my best but I cannot and I feel like shit. A lot of my friends decides to trust me with their secrets and problems and still I constantly fail to support them. Sometimes I wish they did not share that much because having to think about what to do and say to help them stresses me out and its still not enough to be useful. Instead of giving actual good advice I start to tell them what I think they would like to hear and I always end up saying stuff that does not make sense and its just confusing for them. I feel like shit and I just wish they could find someone who can actually give them good advice instead of sticking out with someone that does not even care about them but just wants them to shut up about their problems to go have fun. I hate myself more and more whenever i think about this I cannot support people.,Depression
13993,14013,I am 27 and I have one group of friends that are slowly drifting apart we do not even talk anymore but I consider them friends still because we knew each other for a long time. I live with my mom and my siblings my siblings do not want to hang out with me. My mom is all that I have but we do not do anything together other than talk. So that still leaves me bored throughout the day. I literally sit on the computer all day and when I am not on the computer I am walking around the house looking for something to do or in bed. People who I think are close end up ghosting me like I am nothing to them. I am just so exhausted. I do not have anything to do during the day let alone anyone to spend time with. I am tired of spending everyday alone,Depression
13999,14019,Day in and day out I just sit at home while my parents work. I have 1 friend who I hardly ever see I never change out of my PJs I never get ready I never do anything productive or worthwhile all I do is sit in my house on my computer and eat my meals until its time to shower and go to bed I wake up at noon the next day and do it again it is not even particularly miserable it just sounds that way. It feels just practical to me why would I get ready every day just to do the same thing I do now but uncomfortably. it is just more work for nothing I know I am lazy but what does it even matter I have no responsibilities right now so why should I create any Is it normal to do literally nothing all the time,Depression
14024,14044,I am getting more and more depressed every day. I slept for 14 hours today. Its getting worse and I want help but I legitimately am unable to bring myself to tell my mom. I have been wanting to tell her for a month but I can just not bring myself to tell her. I am sure she would be super compassionate but like any time I am about to tell her I cannot. I just freeze and pretend I am fine. What do I do? SelfDiagnosed Depression,Depression
14052,14072,I feel awful for doing it Is it selfish to cry in public,Depression

14069,14089,I have been depressed for quite a while and only recently I have started to cut myself. Around a month since starting my thighs and arms look like a fucking lion attacked me. Please help I am fucking 16 and if this keeps going on I am afraid it will lead to more drastic forms of sh Need help,Depression
14070,14090,In 2018 I went to college abroad and while I had a great time living there the program was not well run nor did I put in the work and I ended up at home with my parents after one semester. In the fall on 2019 I started school again had one pretty good semester then in early 2020 as you are all aware the world shut down. I was in complete isolation strict quarantine with my parents from March 2020 to April 2021.I made it through my first three semesters at community college largely without incident despite my degrading mental health until Spring 2021 my last semester before earning an associates degree. In the previous semesters I had cheated heavily. Which honestly I do not morally have an issue with given online school but in the Spring 2021 I decided I was done cheating and was going to do it the hard way.Until I did not. I was so close. And then I just stopped. Failed 3 of my 5 classes. I do not know what happened really it just stopped feeling real days and weeks went by and then I would see missed test and missed lab etc etc.My plan was to take my associates and transfer from my communtiy college to a 4 year university. I had to email them and tell them what I just described above and how quarantine made me depressed but that was in the past and it would never happen again.Until it did. I retook the 3 classes I failed in the spring and I am going to fail 2 of the 3. AGAIN. My physics does not even require work. The answers to all the tests quizzes and homeworks are online. The prof does not care. And I just refused to do one assignment over the past 8 weeks. Now my transfer institution is going to reject me my parents are going to flip shit and I will go back to being the dissapointment I am after failing school for the first second and now third time.I do not know how to change. I do not know how to get better. I had something special. A really fucking beautiful awe worthy opportunity to get a real degree in engineering. To graduate like my brothers. And now its gone.it is not the time I am worried about. I am 22 I have plenty. it is not money these community college classes are manageable. it is just that I keep making deeper and deeper cuts chopping myself down as often as possible.I run. I go to the gym. I know how to cook. I meditate. I keep my room orderly. I read when I can. I work. All these tenets of my life just crippled architecture on a broken decaying framework. I do not know what my point is. it is just that it hurts and because it hurts I hurt. I hurt because I hurt myself and it hurts knowing how bad I hurt myself if that makes sense. Continual SelfSabotaging,Depression
14071,14091,I was trying with a girl she was to beautiful for me. But I thought maybe I got a chance she told me your eyes are beautiful we go to a subway to eat a sandwich and after that day she block me. Why? Fucking why? Just block do not told me anything. Fucking God. That shit hurts. I am losing all my confidence. I think I am a fucking weirdo I do not know. She blocked me,Depression
14072,14092,I am 18 M finished year 13 two months ago in May after assessments. I dreaded every single day in school ever since September 2020 because I saw my ex alot we were in 2 classes together. I did have friends but they were more like class mate type not the close type. My close friends I had before I do not really speak to them anymore and now I am basically alone but I do have my family.I got some good grades which the good feeling only lasted for a couple of daysI thought my life would brighten up once the last day of that school was over...I was thrilled for 3 days and then just got caught up in a lot of Netflix gaming feeling empty lots of thinking about why I cannot just better my parents and teachers had hope on me but I am just a bum in my eyes. And also questioning why I cannot be better than my ex I got declined by all the medical schools I applied for. Everyone is of to uni and I feel like I am being left behind and that will be the story for the rest of my life.Looking at myself in the mirror I have gained a little bit of weight but nothing major. But I still feel uglier the lack of jawline six pack stuff.I feel so much loneliness everyday even happy bright songs about love make me feel like shit.Some people on Reddit have said to work on myself it is hard. Everytime I fail I feel like I just fall a step further down.The only thing I really do some what consistently is music production but I am nothing near being at industry level where I can make a living. That gives me reason to believe I have no talents. In my head anyone can do what I do I do not feel special at all.The other thing I do consistently is think negatively and feel lonely afTLDR what do you do if your life does not get better?I feel like there is no point me carrying on and living if my life is just full of loneliness failure talentless and always feeling what ever you do is insufficient. I feel like my life will not get better.,Depression
14077,14097,I numb my pain with pills that are prescribed to me because I have no relationships with anyone else and people treat me very poorly. Last week I found out I was infected with an STI from someone who already treats me like I am nothing. I am just venting here because I was crying at work I just could not hold it in. TW,Depression
14090,14110,haha xd i do not have friends ' I really wish I could cry my soul out on a friends shoulder.,Depression
14104,14124,so a while ago I had a chat with friends and the topic was about girls things hahah periods cuz I have problems with my monthly cycle it is not normal they suggested that I should consult a doctor again because there might be an underlying disease whatever and that I may not be able to get pregnant and have a baby we are currently freshman college students right now so yeah the discussion jumped to plans for the future on like creating a family like when or how many kids they want to have. I felt sad because I do not have any plans for my future I do not see myself in it. Tbh I am sooooo tired of life just going with the flow because I am too weak to actually off myself No plans for future,Depression
14106,14126,I am not going to win. I am just not. Its chronic its not wellcontrolled with medication or therapy. I cannot take care of myself beyond taking medication in the mornings and dragging myself to appointments in the afternoon. I do not know whether Ill starve because I cannot get myself eat or break down from lack of sleep first. Or just speed things up myself.There genuinely is nothing to keep me afloat. I have no reason to be alive. I am not wanted or seen or cared for by anyone. I add nothing at all to the world around me. People avoid me because I am so depressed that I am a burden and annoyance to them. I am so brutally unhappy it hurts and there is nothing I can do to change it. I am going to die. Depression is going to kill me and I am going to be just another statistic. I do not even care because not a single person will notice I am gone in the first place. I am just waiting for my depression to kill me at this point,Depression
14107,14127,14 yo. i do not want to do anything anymore. my passion for everything that i once liked enjoyed or benefited me has gone out of the window. and i do not see the benefit in doing them any more. some days when i wake up from a 4 hour sleep i wish id had just never woken up at all and that i would just fall asleep forever and never wake up again. i always said that dreams were better than real life. and that has been the only statement i have ever made where i think i have been right. i hate talking to other people in fear that i will muck up. I am already quite introverted but now every time some even does something as simple as greeting me i want to get as far away from them as possible to prevent conversation where i will inevitably mess up. my daily schedule now consists of wake up do school go back upstairs and lay there until i have dinner. i have no will to get up and do something that even i know will be good for me. i want to just go away and that is the drifting thought that frequents me in my brain. i believe that everyone hates me which they probably do due to me being very unlikable and they just keep me around for their own social advantage. i frequently want to just run away from every human and cry in a corner where i can just forget i even exist. i do not want to tell anyone and i do not know if that is a good or a bad thing since i probably just burden other people with my presence and i will just annoy and make them hate me. but i want to know if its worth telling someone or if I am just being a teenage hypochondriac. what should i do? sorry for ranting i just needed to get this out of my head and online. i do not want to kill myself. i just want to disappear.,Depression
14124,14144,I think of killing myself everyday. I have tried so hard to deny this but its literally the truth. It does not matter if I am having a good day or not I think about not being alive.I constantly have to immerse myself into art to keep myself from thinking about it. I have to put on my happy face for my family because then they will get worried and be in my face 247 like they did in the past and its triggering. Then again none of them really care. Its like oh she wants to kill herself let me find out why then leavegossip after I doI tend isolate so my friends do not know I struggle with this. Its just sad when I am on calls and everyone is laughing then I am the back of my mind I literally know I just had a severe breakdown an hour ago. I feel like such a fake sometimes. I do not want to overwhelm other people with my problems so I just shut up.I struggle because I feel so empty. No matter what I do or achieve is helpful. I do tons of self care but it does not matter because I know the happiness I feel can shift in minutes.I know my disorder has an strong effect on this and its so draining. It hurts to live. It hurts to not even know who I am sometimes. I often lose interest in whatever I am doing then it comes back then leaves and its a cycle that feels so vicious. Exhausted,Depression
14243,14263,I am not necessarily scared but I am lost I am 30 working in a job industry that I feel like I can make a living in but because of covid it is just so tough houses are God awful expensive I am in debt up to my eyeballs not necessarily including the fact that I feel like I am in a relationship just to live and survive and cannot say that for the fear of everything changing more and me being homeless.. 30 year's old and not sure what to do for my next 30 years...,Depression
14252,14272,After the pandemic started my mother and my sisters addiction issues went out of control. My F21 own anxiety and depression got so horrible and trying to be there for my family was exhausting. I was put on academic probation for a summer 2020 course that I failed and then fall and spring I failed a few more classes all online. I got kicked out of school but everyone told me it would be okay because I could appeal and get back in for fall. I just received word today that the university committee felt that I needed to focus on my mental health more so they denied my appeal and I will not be allowed to apply to the university for at least a year. I worked so hard on my appeal and started going to therapy so that I could get back in school but now I just feel worthless and hopeless like some unusable product of my familys trauma. I am having such horrible thoughts about myself and what I want to do to myself. I know I can go to community college but my parents will be so disappointed in me when they find out. I am not looking forward to just working minimum wage jobs the rest of my life. I got fat during the pandemic and I just want to give up on getting healthy again I want to give up on everything now. Kicked out of university for bad grades,Depression
14281,14301,So just to let you know where my head is at these days Ill tell you about myself. I am 23M. My childhood was physically and emotionally abusive and I was neglected for a long time. The older I get I can see how this stuff has messed with me and how its always been messing with me and the way I socialize with people. I met my dad when I was 18 and he knew how my mom was but he did not want anything to do with me and my sister but he raised our half sister and gave her a great life. I never wanted to have kids and I was with this girl for 3 years and she begged me not to wear a condom said and that she was on birth control and I believed her and now she is pregnant and I am almost certain that its my daughter. She was born in April I think. I do not know her name or where she is. My ex just went crazy when she found out she was pregnant and she got back with her ex and she will not communicate with me at all. So that is what is been going on in my life. Then I met this girl and started talking to her and she seemed to really like me and I really liked her a lot too. But all my anxiety and stuff was messing with me. When someone says something good to me I cannot believe its true for some reason and I feel like things are going to get real bad. This girl is becoming a counselor and she just seemed like the girl that came right out of my dreams. We were going out and having a real good time and then I did not hear from her one day and I got real nervous and had an anxiety attack. I feel so stupid for getting like that and getting attached but I was real nervous and did not want to wait around for her to open my snap so I text her and told her how I felt and that I hope she was not ignoring me and that she can just tell me anything. She text back and was sorry but I said a lot of stupid stuff for it being that early to talk to someone. This went on for another three weeks just being like warm and not like it was before when she was sending hearts and saying good morning sweetheart and saying she loved this and that about me. So these past three weeks just killed me because she said she still wanted to get together and that everything was okay. Anyways I feel like that was too overwhelming for me and I told her how I felt and she started talking and said she was afraid it would not work out because we live like two hours away and she really wanted to be with means that she knew I was attached and she was too but she was afraid it would not work out and that she could not be what I wanted right now. I feel so stupid and I feel like I ruined things. I think I have jus got so much going on these days its already hard for me to function as it is and I was so happy to be talking to this girl it just sucks and I hate myself. I embarrassed myself so bad and ruined something that could have been great.,Depression
14307,14327,I have never had a friend in my life because everyone thinks I am weird. I am 20 years old and in college and I have not made a single friend. I just wish I had friends who I could hang out with and talk to and have a good time with. In high school I had zero friends too. I just do not see the point in living. what is the point of being alive if I do not have any friends?,Depression
14352,14372,there is nothing that seems good to do at the moment. I am laying in bed full of anxiety I would like to just disappear from the universe. it is a month that I do not sleep well and I am so tired of everything totally everything. If you notice my past posts everything started 1 month ago and spiraled down till now. Everyday is hell my family do not understand the gravity of my situation maybe I should just sincerely talk to them and ask for help What do you do when everything seems not appealing and you also have anxiety?,Depression
14362,14382,23M stuck in Life for about 5 years now. I am just at home in front of the PC. Barely going out even tho i try my best doing it. Gained alot of weight and unemployed. My Depression started with 16 even professional help could not help me. I see all the people around me getting a car getting married and such things and I am just the only one stuck. I try my best i cannot do more. I did a trial training in a gym it was fun i liked it but its financial not possible for me. I have to wait now for the woman that is responsible for me since I am unemployed and helps me through it. I just do not know had to write it. i feel pathetic i try little steps but it feels like nothing. Sorry for bad english i hope the post is not an eyesore. Everyone progresses in Life but me,Depression
14372,14392,Is there anyone out there? I am tired of waking up everyday to nothing. I am tired being ignored and feeling like I do not matter. For fucks sake is it too much to ask for just to feel like I matter sometimes? It does not even have to be all the time just like once a month or something. I do not know I try to not let it get to me and I do a great job at hiding all of my feelings and keeping this act up that everything is fine and I am perfectly ok with the fact that I do not matter but sometimes it gets to me. I guess that is what is happening right now its just getting to me is all. I know they say love yourself and all of that bullshit but god damn. When no one cares its hard to do that. Even the people that are supposed to care no matter what unconditionally or whatever your family your parents. When they do not even care how the fuck am I supposed to care? I am just a product of their stupid actions an accident. Shit they remind me all the time anyways. They set me up for failure then they blame me for being a failure. I mean it is my fault I am a failure do not get me wrong I could just keep pretending like nothing bothers me and I have no needs or wants or anything and just keep going or I could just give in and stop hurting every day. I just want the pain to stop really. I want to feel accepted to someone 1 person. It does not take much to make me happy really honestly I am super easy to please but nothing is not cutting it anymore. This world feels so empty and cold,Depression
14393,14413,Last night the my dog was poisoned... and i do not know how to deal with it. it is so unfair. He never ever hurt anyone he was a giant with the biggest and softest heart. He was not even 3 yet. Just typing this is making me cry my eyes out and i cannot stop. Knowing he will never come home again and I will never be able to throw him a ball again.. breaks my heart My dog was poisoned,Depression
14405,14425,it is depressing to know that I actually feel lonely so bad. I did not even notice that I have been being like that before I get physical symtoms. How stupid.. How can I be so crucial to myself? I want to quit eveything. I feel sick of everything. When could I let myself go away from this world,Depression
14436,14456,Money is happiness for me. I will never be rich and instead be more in debt and never fulfill my materialistic dreams. I am a failure at academics and a failure at life and a disappointment to my parents. I hate myself. I am the worst,Depression
14458,14478,I thought today would be different. I woke up early for a change went for some sprints in the park sorted out some Centrelink issues Australian government thing and helped my dad build a vine fence for his garden. I asked my dad for a short break to do do some tasks like buy a new mobile plan and the above Centrelink thing. When I came back down he scolded me saying that i should have left my tasks for night and how shitty of a worker I would be when I actual started working ditching tasks halfway. I guess he wanted me to stick with him and finish his project spending my whole day. And here I am again feeling like shit again because of my father's disapproval. I cannot even talk back because he is got anger issues and goes full retard when I trigger him he smashes plates. He never spent any time with me and only scolded me since childhood and he expects me to want to spend my whole day helping his project. Fk me dead. I thought today would be different,Depression
14466,14486,I am currently in the military. Stationed pretty far away from home. For a good while I thought everything was fine in terms of my mental health but it turns out I had completely disconnected from all emotions because I was hurting. The combination of many events in my life recently really took a toll. When I went home I realized all of this and it was a difficult wake up call. I had fallen into a very deep depression that I feel like I can never climb out of. Now I am trying to make myself stay connected to my emotions but I feel like everyday I wake up there is this plague that has itself tangled in my mind. I had so much going well and I just slipped away so much. Its like I watched myself deteriorate over the past few months. I completely disconnected from friends and family and my relationship. When I went back home everyone said I had changed and that I was not as fun to be around anymore. When I finally opened up to everyone about what Id been bottling up I was told you should have opened up sooner and what you did really hurt me and a lot of other people mainly my girlfriend. The only one who really understood was my mother. I have tried to make it better and show I still care about these people but they tell me its not enough. I am aware of what I did but I did not know how to stop it and I did not know how to open up about any of it. I feel like no matter how hard I fight this battle with depression I will inevitably lose one day and in many ways I feel I already have. I just want everything to get better. I do not know how to start. I just wanted to post because I feel like my support will just throw it in my face if I try to talk to them about it because its happened so much before. Thanks everyone for your support. I am fighting a losing battle,Depression
14471,14491,I have been feeling depressed this year and it intensified after my wedding in May. I am feeling tired demotivated worthless. All i want to do is just to sleep. My husband has not been providing me with the support i need if he did something that triggers my depression and anxiety he would just brush it off or denying things without offering me anything to make me feel better. Which reaffirms my thoughts about being worthless. I started seeing a therapist last week but were only meeting once every week. What would I do in between?I feel so alone. How do i cope? I have no support,Depression
14495,14515,i cry for hours once a week or two i lock myself in the the bathroom and cry silently i want to scream to let the pain go but I cannot let the family hear me they do not accept depression and they will just make it worse telling me I am sick or stupid they will just make my depression far worse even i have a big family i still feel lonely and empty no one cares no one want to listen to me no one wants to do or wants me to do anything it hurts i wish i was not born i wish i died when i almost drowned when i was on that Field trip to the water park I am too coward to end my life i hate myself. Am i the only one who burst out crying once a week or two?,Depression
14498,14518,Nothing scares me more than reading post of older people late 40s saying they wish they killed themselves sooner. I know my life is shit and will not get better plus i hate everything about myself too. Not interested in therapy or hearing other peoples success stories to be honest glad it worked out for ya but in a world of over 8billion people of course you will have unlucky batches I want to die sooner than later,Depression
14508,14528,If you feel like you cannot really trust anyone you personally know with how you truly feel where can you actually turn to?This is a question for all of those who are on the edge of planning something permanent and are seeking a temporary cosmetic answer. Where does one turn to?,Depression
14518,14538,I have posted here a few times under different names. I do not really know why. I guess I am hoping to feel better by shouting into the ether. I know this will not do anything and no one will see it but I find that oddly comforting. I have spent so long being a locked box that I do not know how to be anything else anymore so knowing no one is listening and that no one can help is a comfort. I am almost 30but I have always known where I would end up. Even when I was a kid I would cry myself to sleep knowing that one day I would make everyone and everything around me miserable. Lo and behold here I am. Married. Like an idiot. I just wanted to hope you know? I just wanted to try to fight some cosmic destiny that I felt was waiting for me. Maybe I was wrong? Maybe I could be happy? Maybe I could have a beautiful wife and child. But here I am. Married for 5 years and I have made the woman I love miserable. I have got a beautiful daughter that has to live with ME as a father. Why would I do that to someone? I am supposed to love these people and I was selfish enough to get involved in their lives. she is going to have some sort of emotional and behavioral issues just for being my daughter. Mental illness runs in the family but I was too greedy to not walk away and let her live a life where she did not know me. Where my wife did not choose to marry me. And now they have to suffer for it. They have this waste of space of time in their lives because I was too much of a coward to end it when I was a teenager and now it is too late. I knew I would never be happy or make anyone happy since I was ten. And twenty years later the proof is still here as plain as day but I could not stop myself from trying to live a normal life. I could not accept that it was not what. I deserved. I know they will never see this. But I am sorry. I am truly sorry that you have had the horrible luck of meeting me. there is nothing I could do to ever make it up to either of you. I just hope you will forget me one day. This will get lost too. And that is okay.,Depression
14531,14551,I am in my bf's room and I am going to go to my new job in 6 hrs. I needed comfort and hugs to feel secure and lessen my anxiety. I explain my worries and how I feel useless then later I tell him I wanted to get food from downstairs with him. I wanted some food to ease my anxiety. I ask him if he was hungry. He tells me no then I quickly change my decision bc I did not want to make him go down with me if he was not going to eat. He snaps at me and tells me hates when I get like this. I ask him if he was annoyed w me. He tells me yes bc you are not like this and you would normally go down for food if you were not feeling so anxious. I get extremely saddened by what he said I think because I was already not feeling so good and him saying that made my tears well up. I get quiet and look away because I did not want to choke on my tears. He asks me what is wrong and why I am not saying anything and he sounded more annoyed when I was quiet and shaky with my responses. I just wish he would be empathetic rather than trying to fix things and be logical all the time. How hard is it to give someone a hug and comfort them and tell them everything will be okay. Whoever reads this please any words of comfort will make me feel better. Thank you. I just want comfort,Depression
14539,14559,Nothings enjoyable anymore. At work I do not have friends and cannot figure out how to have a conversation with anyone. At home my mom hates me. Video games used to be my escape but now they do not do anything for me and the people who were my friends just get on to talk about themselves ignore me when then disappear for 2 months.Idk what to do I do not want to wake up anymore,Depression
14580,14600,First and foremost I want to clarify that I recommend anyone and everyone to at least try therapy if you are struggling mentally seriously. This is more based off of personal experience and yours could be totally different. Lots of people have had their lives saved from it. For me though I feel like I am so hopeless and such a lost because that therapy will not do much for me. I feel like this because I am not actually going to make the effort to do anything a therapist tells me to do. Whether that be eating better exercising more journaling every day whatever else. there is tons of great advice therapists have in store but I do not have enough effort to actually do any of it. that is on me obviously I do not blame anyone else for my lack of effort. Its just how I feel whenever I think of trying therapy again. I feel like therapy only works if you are actually willing to better yourself.,Depression
14588,14608,Writing this I am not depressed just a depressing thought. I am so used to never being chosen first and friends reaching out to hangout with me. Or ex's trying to make it work instead of leaving and probably never thinking of me again... Happened recently dropped me like yesterdays paper I do not feel value or wanted and it is a feeling I desire. But as an adult those things kind of leave you and you focus on yourself and hold those close to you closer. And maybe one day you will find the one who is been looking for you in the mean time I am going to do the best I can and try to be my best self without relying on someone else for that support because as I have realized people word does not mean anything and people change. But you will not change you are stuck with yourself your whole life so become someone you enjoy being even if it is not easy or fun all the time. Hope someone reads this and can relate it helps to know people feel the same way as you do I miss the days when people would reach out to me and ask me questions and miss me and think of me before someone else.,Depression
14607,14627,This pandemic cracked my mental health and I just feel like I am lingering in a void I have not been going outside instead I have been inside my room 247 either wasting hours on my bed watching videos or going on my computer I lost my passion for video games and other things I used to enjoy doing my friends and I barely talk anymore we were all close but they all distanced from me since sometimes I would not hangouttalk because I would just have zero energy to link and anything I said would have sounded like an excuse. So everyday feels like a repeating cycle of nothing while my friends are out doing normal teenager summer shitI feel pathetic for wasting my life doing nothing I was intending to get a summer job but my skin condition in the shitty weather would not work another reason why I barely go out I hate being negative but I have had no one to talk to and all these thoughts keep bouncing in my head wanting to get out. I just want to get my shit together and start eating and drinking again taking care of my hygiene and somehow gain weight?? I used to think that I was born with a curse since I was so different from everyone else I do not like thinking that but I feel so lost atm sorry if I sound completely stupid I feel like I hit rock bottom,Depression
14611,14631,I am curious if anyone here has experienced a fall from grace apologies if this is not the most correct term specifically you became the best or highly skilled at something in your life but due to whatever circumstance you are now no longer able to do that thing.A couple examples as it relates to me would be Michael Phelps or Dominique Dawes olympic athletes who competed at an extremely high level and basically devoted their entire lives to becoming the best at their chosen thing or happened to become the best through their drivepassionate. Both of them are no longer able to compete at those levels anymore and have stated in interviews that they suffered from deep depression for a multitude of reasons. What I gather one of the largest reasons is is that they wrapped their entire identities around what they did yet now that they lead more of a normal possibly even mundane life there is a lost sense of self and potentially nothing else could ever compare to their accomplishments life long love pursuits. I am asking this as I have lived this life nonolympic and have felt the same way as the both of them for many years. The problem is that I have not met anyone else personally who is experienced this which is why I am asking and it is just as isolating as the quote it is lonely at the top. What I specifically struggle with now for many years is once you have experienced a joy fulfillment andor accomplishment on such a high level the pursuit of any other endeavor seems almost meaningless. Of course one could hope to strike lightning twice yet your first love ie. the thing that you did seems to always outweigh what anything else could be at least for me. there is also a potential guilt I subconsciously feel about truly choosing to move on to something else. As a side note I have done deep work with a Therapist regarding this which has been beneficial to a degree. I appreciate anyone for taking the time to read this andor lending your own thoughts and experiences. Thank you. Fall from grace,Depression
14615,14635,I am SO FUCKING UPSET AND SAD AND ANGRY AND NONE OF IT EVER GOES AWAY AND I cannot EVEN DO ANYTHING OR FEEL OR SAY ANYTHING AT ALL EXCEPT SADNESS AND ANGER AND FRUSTRATION AND DISBELIEF AT THE FACT THAT I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND REALIZED TIME KEEPS MOVING AND there is NOTHING I CAN DO AND IT is not A DREAM THIS IS ALL REAL AND I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS IS REAL LIFE AND DESPITE ANOTHER DAY TIME RESUMES TURNING THE PAGES OF THE BOOK IT HAS BURNED AND SHREDDED AND IT PISSES ME OFF SO MUCH AND INSTEAD OF GETTING AN ADRENALINE RUSH I JUST FEEL ALL HOT AND ANGRY AND I WRIGGLE LIKE A WORM IN THE SUN WITHIN MY OWN MIND YET MY BODY LIES STILL IN UTTER DISBELIEF AT ITS OWN INCOMPETENCE AND INABILITY TO COPE WITH THE UTTER SKULLFUCK OF EMOTIONAL FUCKERY THAT NEVER CEASES TO FLOW FROM EVERY NEURON FIRING AT ONCE IN MY BRAINgoodnight. I am SO ANGRY AND SAD AND I do not EVEN WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT,Depression
14624,14644,Things just happen to go worse and worse and I feel like it is never going to go better at all I wish I had an escape pod I try to tell myself hey there are so many others in such rough situations look at them try to hold on but the pain the pain just does not feel any less I wish I had someone to support me someone I could have fully opened up to but there is not and even that feels like such a far fetched dream The chaos just keeps on increasing at this rate I almost feel like giving up on everything and not giving a damn at all Does it ever get better,Depression
14636,14656,18F and I am slipping back. I thought I was finally under control. I am not. I am miserable. I hate myself my body my eyes my hair everything. I just want to be happy. I lost a lot of weight from a ed and everyone talks about how good I look but my brain hates myself. I was at my first goal weight but recently gained 5 pounds because I started getting too thin and then lost one. This spun me into a spiral. I lost my job my partner left. This new weight gain that I thought would look good. I hate it.Today was my first day of college orientation. It was fun actually. I love school and learning. Although I do not have many friends I only have one I loved learning and having meaning. I got hired at a new place. Yet I still feel that emptinessthat cold grey feeling where you are floating and cannot see. does not help I am having issues with my partner. Hes been distancing himself I know it he probably does not love me anymore. Who could love someone who does not even love themselves.I have hidden my depression since the last time I opened up I was thrown into a sht hole sad excuse of a mental hospital. I hide it. No one even knows because who do I have to open up to? My parents think I am going to be some great person that I am doing great and I am fine. My partner like I said is distancing himself I only have one friend and I cannot tell her. So who does that leave ? No one. I am so alone but not. I hide away and wait till night to cry or in my car or in the shower. I wish I was not so messed up. I wish I did not think about oding on those pills on my counter. I just want to be at peace god. Please. First day of college orientation. Is there any hope anymore?,Depression
14679,14699,You see I am younger 15 to be precise and when I look at so much they accomplished it makes me feel like shit at my age in Sengoku Jidai there were literal 15 year olds who actually fought with bravery hell there are people younger than me that have more talent and will grow up to be something my point is there have been so many people who have done more Octavian Augustus was 18 fucking 18 when he lead Rome against his enemies point is every day I see people doing more than I could ever do I am not even sure if I am depressed or if I am looking for attention and even myself does not realize it which makes me feel worse I almost feel like a side character in my own life my sister is studying to be a nurse and getting good grades my older brother can sing a little my mother is developing her own company for makeup and other products and when I try to enjoy history it feels like the world keeps on putting examples of great accomplishments in front of my face sometimes I even cry while watching history videos not out of pity for them but out of disappointment of myself The thing is I cannot find one thing good about myself and I cannot see why living is even good if you have a ambition you can never reach because you lack the skills needed why do you struggle the only reason I live now is out of fear of death of course I do believe I am going to the asphodel meadows when I die but I still fear death and I am hoping one day if it does get worse I will at least have the heart to act it out instead of turning back like I always do Looking at history make me feel inferior,Depression
14707,14727,I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder though i am not sure if i ever actually had it. I had a couple years where i was on a lot of drugs both prescription and non prescription which caused severe depression but i know that was just because the drugs were screwing with my brain specifically opioids and antidepressants. It majorly improved once i was off them. I know that i have anxiety and many social issues possibly autism. But when i really look at it basically every time i was depressed it was because i was obsessively worrying or terrified of somethingsomeone or overthinking about a past experience. I am able to pull myself out of these depressive episodes with change of environment except for the time it was caused by the drugs and on the unusual occasion when something really bad happens. From what i understand people with major depressive disorder are not able to do that very easily or at all. I am starting to believe i never had true major depression but depressive symptoms from other issues such as the anxiety social issues or past trauma along with just being in a bad environment andor with bad people. I do not think that my negative feelings about life and the world are irrational or caused by depression i am just naturally pessimistic and have still been able to feel better without changing that i have no desire to i am perfectly fine with being a pessimist..i actually felt worse when i was trying to be more optimistic. Maybe the reason treatments have never worked is because they are just treating a symptom and not the real issue? Can depression just be a symptom of another condition? I am questioning if i ever had depression at all,Depression
14708,14728,It just feels like a drug. A bottle to drown the pain and a knife to because some fukcing dammage. It might just be me but the week of pain from one night just feels deserved. Fuck me! Why is cutting an instinct,Depression
14709,14729,lol that is pretty much it. They go from being a stranger to a friend to your best friend to the love of your life to a stranger. When you think you found the one... but they shatter your heart.,Depression
14741,14761,So I just dropped my BF 31 off at the hospital this morning for the first time ever. He had an attempted suicide in the night by taking extra antidepressants when he woke up in the middle of the night. Hes been open with me about being depressed and has been good about taking his medication. The whole situation was scary. I called in sick right away to spend the day with him which is when he proceeded to tell me why he was upset and what happened in the middle of the night while I slept. When we got to emerg I was told I could not go in with him so I waited in the car. They got him in quickly and I was being updated as they slowly took everything away from him and he spoke with medical people. Then they took his phone and it hit me like a tone of bricks. I had no idea anything that was happening and I was just trusting these people. Covid fucking sucks! I wanted to be there ask the doctors what is happening what hes allowed or not. I wanted to bring him a snack when he was hungry. All I could do was hold on tight to my phone for the day and hope I would hear from him. I have received 2 calls from him now. I know a bit more but I am still on edge. Any significant others on here that have some advice for how to do this? I am just very scared but logically I know hes in a safe space. First hospital visit,Depression
14742,14762,These were the symptoms of the last two antidepressants I tried. Starting my new ones in a few days hopefully third time's the charm cannot cum or lose weight,Depression
14788,14808,It does not matter how often I try to tell myself that Ill get through it or how often I hear others say that it will get better. I know it will not. I know that better does not exist for me because I was never good. I was always like this and Ill stay like this for the rest of my life no matter how hard I try and I am so tired of telling myself it will get better when I know its a lie. I do not want to work on myself anymore. I do not want to try. Antidepressants were my last hope I was already sure I would not be able to get better by myself but then I tried so many different antidepressants and none of them worked they all made me feel worse. I do not want to try another medication. I do not want to go to therapy. I do not want to work for a future that I know I do not have. I know it will not get better as long as I am me so why even try anymore. I destroy everything for myself anyways. I do not believe it will ever get better,Depression
14810,14830,Every day at some point I have a weird moment where I feel like I am going through the motions and i feel like my life is going faster than I can control it. It feels as though events are happening and I do not have the means to control any of it. I feel as though it is flashing before me and all I can do is watch helplessly. For a long time now I have struggled with finding pleasure in a lot of things. All of the things that used to make me happy seem to have fizzled out. Trying new hobbies seems too much of an effort and daunting task. Most of them that I research I do not have much of an interest in nor the mental capacity to try them. I have finished college. Have my dream truck. Make great money. Have a nice house. Have pets. Have a long term relationship. No material things are placed on a pedestal...I just do not seem to have much satisfaction in my achievements or activities. I am so emotionally exhausted after work that its very tough to dig myself out of this place. Prescribed Medicine seems to dull it temporarily and I only have 1 friend who somewhat understands how I feel. do not know where to start. do not know what to do. Its been like this so long I have burnt myself out thinking about it. The only thing that gets rid of it is constantly staying busy or sleep...sometimes...Any advice on those who have also experienced this and came out of it would be appreciated. Stuck in the fog,Depression
14818,14838,I lay in bed for hours to the point of back pain. I get up for work 30 minutes before I have to clock in. I have no motivation to do anything on my days off I literally stare at my computer screen and have to force myself to do something. The bare minimum. More and more I find myself wanting to end it. Would that be so bad? I ask myself. I am lonely always broke hopeless and disgusting looking and half blind. I know nobody could ever actually want me. I have a decent paying job but am always playing catch up financially.In the end I resolve not to kill myself though I do not want to continue living. I would not be upset if something killed me. No I think Id be grateful. I am always tired.,Depression
14845,14865,Some of the earliest thoughts I remember were of how I hated the voice in my head. When I was young all I ever wanted to be was older and I learned to hate and look down on all kids including myself. Just about every facet of life that I could not control as well as some that I could I loathed myself for. I have always been too introspective for my own good and as I got older my selfloathing only festered and grew. I was extremely outgoing and focused on making myself a target to be laughed at for popularity which I despised myself for needing the attention. In order to compensate for the overwhelming guilt I constantly caused myself as soon as I hit the age for dating I never stopped and throughout my school days hopped in and out of doomed relationships in order to distract myself from myself. I would always put my girlfriend on a pedestal and give her anything and everything they would want... until eventually I lost feelings and became numb to them and myself for a while before moving on to a new distraction. With each failed relationships added a host of new reasons to hate myself for. My last two years of high school is when I developed depression and I ended up getting ostracized from my friend group. When my depression started I became immediately and increasingly self destructive until eventually I decided that I wanted to force my personality to change completely. Through much selfdeprecation I stopped being the funny and loud extrovert and became silent and pushed everyone away. During this time of isolation my mental health plummeted and over a long term unhealthy relationship I finally became totally emotionally numb. At this point I feel dissociated and the only way I can get my brain to feel something is by smoking doing drugs starving myself cutting or masturbating and anytime I attempt to quit any of the coping mechanisms I just end up doing the others a dangerous amount more.I feel stuck. I have no will to get better. I cannot muster the desire to do anything positive for myself because of my self loathing. At this point I think I am incapable of loving myself. And because of it I ruin every relationship I have. I am the ghost of my family the pity of my acquaintances and I just lost the only person who I thought really understood me.I genuinely feel at the end of my rope and I hate myself for being too scared to let go. i will never find true fulfillment in life because i am incapable of loving myself,Depression
14858,14878,Hmm how to put this this thing called love its just a fantasm created by humans to feel safe or idk I mean I did not see it heart it taste it smell it touch it or feel it so I really really do not understand people who believe in this thing which is 7 billion humans except 1? Or maybe not even 1. What I mean is that how can you devote ur life to someone or live with himher ur entire existence or Life. Lol I think that I will never understand. I think that love does not exist,Depression
14870,14890,Hey allDoes anyone know a way to get through summer school? Ill cheat if I have to. I am so tired and I am sick of school interrupting every minute of my life and I just want it to end and get it out of the way. I have no motivation and school is starting in about a month and I cannot do it. I try to talk to my mom about it but she thinks my depression is an excuse when I am taking 125mg of sertraline daily and its getting to the point I want to either run away from home or end my life.I am taking red comet for summer school and I am studying pre calculus. If anyone knows a way to get the answers Id appreciate it. I need help with online summer school because I do not have the patience nor the motivation.,Depression
14872,14892,I am sick and tired of people bullshit. I love how I can be talking to a women for a few months go on dates and everything and be having a good time. But soon as they realize that I get attached easily. Also that I am insecure about the relationship and need reassurance every once awhile becuase I have been cheated on numerous times and been fucked over by family and friends they just up and leave without a fucking care in the world. I just cannot do this shit anymore. Honestly I wish I could just fucking die and not need to worry about it anymore. Becuase I fucking hate being lonely it is the worst feeling in the world for me and I just do not fucking understand the double standard in life. It is fine for a woman to act like this in a relationship but soon as a guy does it he is practically trash to them. I regret joining the marines now just becuase of how mentally fucked the left me when I got out and I just want to be done with it. Fucking done with everything,Depression
14883,14903,The title is pretty much what I wanted to ask. That said I am brand new and have only done one test stream so far. My only steaming goal is to get 4 consistent followers by the end of the year but right now I am not expecting viewers.I am starting with hidden object games. And all you would need is a discord account and any mic you have.Laptop from a phone web cams mic anything that works.I love discussing story characters inspirations and any random topic that might pop up.It will pop up my ADHA meds can only do so much. Other non game related topics are things like food artcrafting anime living with depression and other psychiatric disorders plants animalsI have 3 reptiles fandom books and shows. With other stuff you may want to talk about.I am doing this to help me work on my confidence and public speaking as well as a way to have fun. So it probably will not be seen by manyor any people so it is more like us talking over discord with me screen sharing. So it is low pressure and you can have veto power over deleting the stream once over.My schedule is very flexible and I live in the US MDT or GMT6 time zone. If anyone would be interested feel free to commentmassage me if you want to talk more about it. I do not know anyone who like hidden object games so this is my attempt at finding someone.Again no pressure. And thanks for reading this far down Would someone like to talk during small twitch streams? No long term commitment and no judgement if you need to back out.,Depression
14888,14908,A person I have fallen in love with I think has just let me know that we are not going forward I have been depressed for a while now and they were of my only friends really. I do not have anyone else to tell and this just feels like a big snowpile on what I was already feeling I am feeling really down I do not have anyone to talk about it with either,Depression
14908,14928,Maybe its just me alone in this but it feels like both the job market and the housing market are so inexplicably fucked. I am 23 years old and still live with my fucking family because no matter what fucking job I get I do not make enough fucking money to live in this shit hole of a town. Tried to apply for something better with my degree and instead I just hear Jack shit back. No apartments or homes available for rent are anywhere near my price range and I just cannot move out of town because that costs money I do not fucking have. This close to ending it all because there is no way out. Fuck it all Everything is so fucked,Depression
14912,14932,months after quitting my antidepressants I do not have the same feeling of depressed brain fog but the pain of it all never goes away. I am convinced I am still better off without them and I think my mind has been a bit healthier since I was able to quit but the emotional and physical pain brought from the depression and anxiety are not much better.there is more good days without the meds but the bad days still tear me down. I have not gone a single day without thinking about harming and suicide in almost a decade. I am terrified of hurting the people around by ending my life but I do not know how much longer that fear can keep me here. there never seems to be a way I can really articulate the pain I am in and I am ready for it all to stop. posting here has not been very helpful in the past but I am desperate and cannot keep myself going anymore it never ends,Depression
14988,15008,The only thing you look forward to is sleep. I wish i could live in a dream You know you are depressed when,Depression
15004,15024,I should be doing all kinds of stuff but I can hardly be arsed to do even one. All day long I just check my phone and procrastinate. This is the worst bout of depression I have ever had. How do I get myself to care again because I do not. Cycle of unproductivity,Depression
15005,15025,I was born and raised in a big city. Where ever I go it always seems like everybody around me has someone accompanying them. The bar the zoo the museum etc. Everybody is always with at least one other person. Rarely ever do I see people going on solo adventures like me. they are always either in a group of friends have kids with them or they are with their partner. Whereas all of my friends either do not live in my city anymore or they have tight schedules that make it difficult for us to plan hanging out. So because of that I have only been able to go on solo adventures. It feels so isolating always being surrounded by couplesgroups every time I go out by myself. I wish I had a friend who could accompany me to those places. Loneliness in a city full of thousands of people,Depression
15026,15046,Were in a heatwave in the UK right now and my mood seems to be worse than ever. I almost feel disassociated with a baseline of anxiety and panic and total uncertainty. Anyone else finding the heat and the sun making their depressive symptoms worse? Hot Weather Symptoms Worse,Depression
15052,15072,So I 17y F am so tired of my alchoolic father that one day I even taught about running away or commiting suicide I do not feel safe around him. I feel terrified of him. Basically EVERY DAY when he comes back to work he goes at his friends who he has a drink with then he comes back home enraged and he will scream at every member of my family for no fucking reason. He never hit me or some shit like that but you know the saying Words cut deeper than a knife. I am thinking about moving out with my boyfriend next year when I will be 18 that would be a dream but then I would lose all my family including my mother who is the only one supporting me in all of this this she does not agree with moving out so early. How can I just get rid of all of this? My abusive father,Depression
15054,15074,I have depression and anxiety due to series of traumatic events. Sometimes I am just too exhausted even though I am not doing anything. Just plain on survival mode through the years. I do not want this as an excuse but it is my reality. Struggling to do something. Anxious that I end up doing nothing. That by not performing I am bad. I am made to feel guilty from grieving. I also had a dysfunctional childhood. I have just lately discovering that it was not a good childhood as I have thought it was. Thr way I was brought up and my childhood experiences paved way to why I am like this in adulthood. I am grieving. My parents does not grasp that their adult child is mentally unwell. Of course it is my fault. I get all the blame. It hurts when your own mother would label you some deregatory term in our language dugyot means a lazy dirty person. It hurts that they do not understand my struggles. I am trying. I grieve that I will never have the parents that I needed. I was crying silently last night. I was a victim of domestic abuse and they offered me to come move back. I know I need therapy but I do not have the means to pay yet. I am just hoping one day to get myself on my own feet and get my own place again. Away from the judgement shame and guilt that are in this household. Mother called me names. It hurts,Depression
15061,15081,I do not enjoy anything about life. I force myself to exercise read and partake in my hobbies because I do not want to be an empty person who does not even make an effort but that has not stopped me from being miserable. Sometimes getting drunk gives me relief but I have to stop since I am on the path to becoming an alcoholic and lack the funds to keep drinking at this rate. I live in a dead area and have no clue how I am supposed to meet someone. I am basically stuck in this position indefinitely until I get a much higher paying job. Unfortunately trying to find one has been a fruitless demoralizing experience with no seemingly no hope. I probably will not be happy even if I get out of this either. I was miserable in college but when I look at it objectively that was the best part of my life by far. My life afterwards has been all work technical assessments and interviews with very little social interaction its soulsucking and this is supposed to continue until I retire. I just do not get how more people are not lining up to kill themselves hell I think about it every day. The expected cycle of life is utter garbage. No part of life is enjoyable,Depression
15080,15100,Recently I have been plagued with these violent thoughts which have left me exhausted they are like episodes of violence towards myself but I do not know why its happeningIve reached out for help telling people I am going to kill myself and even asked to be put in a hospital for my safety but no one cares I have talked to a crisis team and the access team but they are not helping meIs there anything I can do to stay safe? Depression and suicidal thoughts,Depression
15100,15120,HiI have been in a few therapy sessions up until now. I decided to go because I have mild depression and I have a hard time accepting that I am gay. Not in the sense that I think it is wrong but because I do not want to feel different. A few days ago I finally decided to come out to my therapist. There are only a few people I have come out to so this is still really hard for me. The first few minutes I could not even talk... But my therapist went immediately into trying to explain why I am gay. Linking it to the problems with my mom and thinking out loud if I might seem to look for comfort with women because my mom was not emotionally available. They then went on to ask me how I would know if I am gay since I have dated neither men nor women. Ending up with them telling me that they had no problem with gay people. Which I hate when people say that after I come out. Like okay... that is kind of what I expected. But now I am actually questioning if you actually feel that way I am at such a low point. They said everything I am afraid people say when I come out to them. I feel like they broke my trust... Worst way this could have gone,Depression
15120,15140,Was reading some article about how your parents' love style and how they behave influences your own love style and... personality? mind blowing stuff i know s. it is not like i never thought about it before but it only just hit home how similar i have become to my mother in terms of this stuff and how much they have really affected me which was very distressing because i really do not want to be like her. But it feels too late.Absolutely terrified of intimacy to the point where we will just run away if we feel too cornered or push the person away completely and yet constantly lonely. Trouble expressing emotion even admitting to ourselves that we are feeling it and we definitely are not going to share it with anyone else. I could go on but then I would be here all day. Typing it into reddit is not as hard because it feels like screaming into the void though i am constantly paranoid about my online activity. And i just feel so alone but also never able to let anyone in. The only way for me to even talk about emotion or dosay anything intimate is to sort of repress my mind from the situation disassociate maybe? Or to get absolutely wasted. Just realised i am the same as my mother,Depression
15127,15147,If there is not I think we can do it it might help to see people with depression too it would feel like we are not alone if you want to join this just send me your snap name s there a snapchat grpup that everyone talk about their depression,Depression
15168,15188,I just got pushed down more and they just told me my opinion does not matter. Like bitch I am also part of this family if you do not like me just kill me as if i ever enjoyed your company. I just for once tried opening up with people and got out of my she will but people just hate me and i just got pushed down more. when you ask your kid to open up for years and then one day finally he tries opening up you just push him down further congratulations. Just giving me more reasons to remain in my she will depressed and to hate them and myself just have to now live life like this till the point i break because they are never going to change.In this past week i already lost my best friend. I am just useless i could not even save her how am i supposed to save myself. I just hate myself Today i finally tried talking more with my family and tried to open up and guess what,Depression
15187,15207,I was sleeping with my bird today it was her favourite thing to do but when I woke up she would been crushed by me and I killed her when I was sleeping. I miss her so much I would give anything to not do it but I cannot stop thinking about it and it is all my fault I killed her and that is it if I had taken her out of my room she would still be alive but I am stupid and selfish and didn'tSo what do I do please help me I killed my bird today,Depression
15188,15208,Turns out my sister runs the local crisis center. The dumb duck on the phone did not tell me the director of the place has the same last name as me. There is literally no help for me. USA I called the National suicide hotline and my whole family found out,Depression
15198,15218,Throwaway account. I feel ashamed of myself for failing at school.. for failing at every attempt I tried to become successful.. I am ashamed of myself.I am ashamed of myself.I am ashamed of myself.I am ashamed of myself.I am ashamed of myself.I am ashamed of myself.I am ashamed of myself. I feel I have put my family behind... I could have given my daughter better things by now if I did not fuck it all up... and I keep fucking things up as I try to make things better. I should have just stayed home a few more extra hours when my appendix raptured and my death could have been excused but now I have to live with feeling of wanting to die but cannot do it because I would ruin other peoples life... I am such a loner.. I am thankful for my wife. my sister. my mom. my daughter. that is it. I got no one else. have not had a conversation that matters with anyone else in over 10 years. I come off as a weirdo. I guess things could be worst but they could have certainly been better if it was not for my stupid ass. Feeling the pressure,Depression
15215,15235,My main symptom right now is strong brain fog. Not necessarily in the sense of being forgetful or mentally slow more in a sense of a foggy feeling in my mind almost as if I am drunk all the time. Has any of you any experience with antidepressants lifting brain fog? And can you recommend anything specific that I could ask my doctor about? I was offered to be prescribed meds but I am hesitant if this is even the right thing for me. Experiences with antidepressants,Depression
15243,15263,By all accounts I should be dead right now. The amount of pain and hardship I have been through is not something that I can just live with. Basically any kind of normal life for me is out of the question. Despite me being depressed 247 I am just not in the mood to end it. What the hell? Why do I still want to go on?,Depression
15253,15273,This sucks I am really happy i am marrying the love of my life i am happy that i am planning this wedding but a part of me is depressed n sad bc my best friend my sister is not here with me to help with my big day but she will always be my maid of honor like i promised she passed away in feb and was only 32 we grew up togeather been best friends?sisters dor 25 years Depressed,Depression
15266,15286,Starting to become that clich attention starved girl...on the internet praying to make some type of connection with another human being because I cannot be ALONE with these thoughts anymore always searching for validation,Depression
15278,15298,If I become inactive in Reddit it means I have moved to another life already.I have 200 dollars in my wallet and since I look like a grown up I plan to hitch a hike to tall building will not tell where. Get permission to go on top of building and fall off.I imagine that when I am falling it would be the most euphoric moments of my life its the end I will not have to deal with bullshit anymore. No more shit no more shit.Considering quarantine rules I might delay this when the pandemic is over The plan,Depression
15323,15343,Last year my best friend passed away in her sleep. She meant the world to not only me but my wife too. They were the best of friends. She gave us a glimmer in this world of hope everything really could get better. Financial stability was not easy to come by due to covid and we lived with some really bad people. We were very much obliged when she helped us get back on our feet. Alas her health had gotten to a point where she could not exactly take care of herself as much she used to. We offered to take care of her accordingly but.. it was too late.This year.. when it felt like everything would bounce back after the 'year that did not happen' came to pass our eyes opened wider. A family friend of over fifteen years had committed suicide. Simply put this sweet man just could not do it anymore. He had been struggling far more than we all imagined. Needless to say and to not get incredibly personal the light of his world had more or less given up on him prior. She wanted to call it quits with a divorce. That killed him quicker than any poison I have ever seen kill a man. He was battling his own demons indeed and we truly did not see everything from behind the scenes. But we knew and always had our arms open offering guidance. But ..it was still too late.we have seen many people come and go since these devastating events have occurred. Everyday we grow further apart with what we thought was a friend group. I have lost countless friends to drugs sickness and crime. My wife and I have helped many through every possible tragedy and life stressors to finally get to the point where we have nobody left to help so to speak. Everyone seems to move on.. I cannot find the light anymore. I cannot find a reason to smile. If it was not for my wife I do not know what I would do. I will be celebrating my birthday on the 25th alone with her.I have no friends truly. Only memories. I live in a world without color and I am afraid I lost my smile forever. Am I selfish?,Depression
15334,15354,Took me being really fn high to realize she is keeping me around just like I am keeping her around I just did not realize till this second that is what is happening. I always thought it was me putting more of the chase? WOW,Depression
15351,15371,Just lay it out there why is it even worth living I have had money I have blown money I messed up big time in high school never went to college have no options what is the point and do not give me some sappy bullshit. I need a reason. Someone give me a reason to live,Depression
15397,15417,Is it just me or do you just feel like your not there your just not ther. Your family can see you your most loved one cannot see you your emotions do not matter to anyone but when someone needs some guess who is there me I am there the next day I need help I am on the edge of killing my self who is there??? No one just me what is stopping me I do not know why cannot I cry? Why cannot I do anything right I am a fuck up. I bet all my friends are talking behind my back do I have friends? Am I all alone people might say their there but are they who knows. Salt and sugar are the same color how do I know who cares for me she thinks I am an idiot everyone thinks I am idiot people say they will miss me if I am dead but is that true its too much for me I am about to give up this might be goodbye who knows What am I?,Depression
15403,15423,A few days ago I had the realization that I do not want to die like ever. This thought has been keeping me up at night crying. It sucks that we all HAVE to die and all I can think about is how nothing matters because were going to die and We cannot do anything about it. Then I think about how Its not fair because I did not ask to be born so why could not another human be born who can maybe accept dying better than me. Our whole lives were basically chosen for us. I mean who knows maybe I am overthinking like this because its not really dying I am scared of but what is after? Or both? because when you die that is it.. what does it feel like to just have your body shut completely off forever? No more thoughts no feelings no more...life. I mean yeah none of us really know what happens after death and some people think of reincarnation or other things as a coping mechanism. I used to think like that up until I really thought about it I mean I am definitely open minded so that thought is definitely still there but what if all the things that we think happen does not actually happen. I mean will we actually reincarnate? Even if we did the sun is going to explode eventually and take us with it right?why does dying have to be so hard to accept for me when I know its inevitable? let us talk about death,Depression
15412,15432,I am at the point in the summer break where for the past week I have been doing nothing but waiting to go to sleep. Every morning I will wake up at some absurd time this morning it was 3 in the afternoon where other days it is 3 in the morning and just waiting until I am tired enough to be able to close my eyes and go to sleep. I cannot go out and do anything the bright sun hurts my eyes. For the past few days I have barely been able to be arsed to check my emails. My friends are either scattered around the world or working I cannot get get any professors to take me on for research any local tutoring companies to hire me without federal workstudy that I do not qualify for and would genuinely rather swallow razor blades than be a waiter. I have been struggling to maintain focus and interest in the things that once captivated me for days like math and writing. I think the only times I have been outside in the past month were to buy groceries and liquor.This happens every summer. The boredom the lack of impetus to do anything where the high point in my day is when it is over and closer to the end of summer. I do not feel happy or sad or angry or anything anymore just hollow. I truly cannot fucking wait for school to start again. I really truly hate the summer,Depression
15475,15495,I 29F went no contact with my abusive family over 4 years back after finding out about personality disorders and finally understanding they will never not try to hurt me and that so many of my issues stem from being severely abused all my life. The process of my freedom got super messy eventually I had to leave everything behind and relocate to another country with one suitcase. I finally started feeling better and taking care of myself even though i had very bad anxiety for being stalked by them. After 2 years when i was already back in my country they found me with the help of a private investigator and a lot of flying monkeys and that is when everything went to s again. They had me kicked out of my apartment lose my furniture steal my car because legal troubles with my company and in my private life etc. I had already lost all my friends and everybody i knew the first time i left them because they contacted all of them and started smear campaigns against me. First i was playing along as i knew that was the best thing i could do atm but then as soon as i had the chance i moved abroad again just to be away from them. This was about 2 years ago. I am from a small country and whenever i have to go back i feel extremely uneasy as the memories of being followed stalked reported on and investigated still live within me. I do not think i can ever go back while they are still alive. They are simply too invested in my abuse and they unfortunately have the resources to because troubles for me. They would never leave me be without trying to hurt me control me make me go crazy. I have been trying to find my place abroad eversince i relocated but that initial strength and power i felt after breaking free is gone. Now I am just tired. I do not know how to mentally process the fact that against all odds i successfully identified and left narcissistic abuse i was subject to it all my life hella brainwashed then managed to self improve get better and finally take care of myself on my own for the first time in my life just to have it all ripped away from me because of some shady private investigator and a couple other people helping them destroy my life in exchange for some money. I feel like that was my only chance and I cannot replicate it anymore. My depression along with my physical health issues are getting worse and i very often have intrusive thoughts about suicide. I feel like I am not strong enough to go back to normal or to start everything from the beginning again. I feel like all the energy i had left was sucked out of me the second time I had to lose it all. Now I am just passing time basically i clearly have not recovered as well as i initially thought i had every day depression takes a toll on me and even though i do not live in direct abuse anymore i feel hopeless and unable to live a full normal life ever again. All i want is to move on but i think i broke and I am not capable of doing that anymore. Feeling stuck,Depression
15502,15522,Hi everyone I used to have depression but not any more since I have met my girlfriend but my girlfriend still have depression. she will have days where she laid down on bed all day and will not tell me what is wrong. I am in a situation with my physical health and I told her I need her to be strong for me and she said she will but because of her depression and anxiety she tends to stress easily and goes into depression. Should I face the fact that she cannot be strong for me and give up? I have been trying to help her with all of my heart but it seems like it is all going to waste. What should I do? Depressed Girlfriend,Depression
15513,15533,Idk anymore I feel like shit every night I feel like shit every morning I feel like shut 247 I try and self improve everyday of my life but every day at the end of the day all the thoughts come creepin in and I feel more and more like a weak failure. Idk how much longer I can take those thoughts. It sounds cringy but it is true. I genuinely do not know what is going to happen to me. Idk anymore,Depression
15517,15537,my hopes are dying down really fast nothings going well I am not getting anywhere. I am trying to make more friends but I am desperately struggling they either do not text back or start ghosting me. i started cutting again after a few weeks of being away this time i do not know its not mainly to cope more like giving myself pain for making others suffer. every time i make a mistake fail to help someone or anything bad in general i count them and tally it onto my arms. i do not count the smallest of bad things because I am going to be tatted with marks all over my body and i want the pain for only things that are significant to me. here is a diary entry from 18th july 1138pmtoday was a really shitty day but i love her so fucking much. i fucking hate how i messed up so fucking bad that she lost feelings. i want to marry her i love her that much but cannot even give her anything to like me for anymore. ihope she finds someone that loves her more than me because i clearly fucking could not. i cut today and ill cut again tomorrow for all the stupid shit I have done. i wish id fucking die and suffer the pain to see her either get back with him or get with someone better than me.goodnight end noteit may seem a dramatic as fuck but i do not know what to do anymore. I am not even attending my online school and i hate it so much that i have not seen my friends in so long. life is not okay.have a good day cya life is not okay amp8ampamp,Depression
15519,15539,I am okay. I am not a threat to myself or others. But every day just gets harder...Right now I am supporting myself and two other people one of them my wife. My job requires me to help support a further six people all cognitively delayed adults. I know that none of this matters it is just my life.I live in a state where people value independence traditional manliness guns and Donald Trump. I recognize that my experience does not fucking matter I am just another deviant leftist. I am poor. Both my parents were teachers so we did not start with much but I managed to lose everything I had and more. I have been homeless twice. Both times I clawed my way back from nothing. I recognize that I do not know shit about shit and I need to shut my fucking mouth and listen to my betters. I am so fucking tired. I know I do not matter but I keep trying anyway. I am stupid like that. Barely holding together,Depression
15542,15562,I just cannot. I do not want to die I want to make my family hurt but I literally cannot do it any more. I am not able to work full time because of depression and I think that once my money is up I will take the big leap to nonexistence. I literally do not have the energy for life any more. I literally cannot do it any more...,Depression
15566,15586,You ever just get that feeling of nimbly scrolling through an app listening to music. At this point its not even sad it just drowns out everything else? You do not even cry. You feel like you have to cry but you just cannot? you go through your whole day with fake smiles and laughs so everyone thinks you are okay. Or you just lay in bed numb and feel like nothing is real? Its okay....me too... Existing sort of,Depression
15587,15607,I know people love me. My great grandparents my dad my little brothers my mom my cousins and aunts. My boyfriend. But I feel like no one loves me. And its so hard to explain to them because they do not understand. I feel suicidal sometimes and I wish I could do it but then I think about my great grandparents and my brothers and how could I do that to them? I wish I had no one so I would not have to think about them. My boyfriend thinks I get depressed for no reason. But its not just one thing that sends me into an episode. Sure its that one thing. But along with 50 other things that were on the back burner all hitting me at once. I just hate myself so much. I try not to compare myself to others but once I do I just start thinking about how much better everyone is and how I am wasting space just floating by. I wish I was never born. I start crying then my boyfriend just thinks here we go again.. He tries. But nothing helps except sleep and time. I am not motivated at all. I have no interests. I just scroll through social media. No desire for sex. And I know he deserves better. But he says he loves me. But another girl could treat him better. Be happy all the time. Want sex all the time. Not shut down and wish she was dead. I stress him out. I know it. I am just pathetic. Feeling so alone when you know people love you.,Depression
15620,15640,I have had everything I ever asked for twice and still I was unhappy and ungrateful. I am not the suicidal depressed more the laugh at myself and life sucks let us get on with it kind of depressed. I have a daughter with an incredible woman who I kind of broke many years ago I left her when she needed me most. It tore her apart and 5 years later I am back with her but she only looks like that woman. She is not the same person and I am a twat for thinking she would be. The other time I got what I asked for was another woman she was hands down the best person I had ever met. She could see I was just an emotionless void but my god she loved me she wanted to spend her life with me get a house marriage etc. She was beautiful too but I just could not appreciate her for who she was. She begged and begged for me to stay as she loved me more than anything else. Threw her away and got back with the mother of my daughter. I warned the second woman many many times I am not a good person many times but she would not accept it and even after all this I do not think she is changed her opinion. Depression is horrible not for what it can do to you but what it can do to others. Either life would have made me happy yet both times I have chucked it away. I know to many my complaints are trivial. Some of you guys have it so so much worse but guess that void just hits no matter how good your life can be. One day I will probably look back on this post and laugh but until that time I needed this. Just need it off my chest I suppose.,Depression
15636,15656,All I can do is hope that my depression goes away which is a shot in the dark. It has not gone away since last year and I do not see it going away any time soon. My anxiety has gotten so bad that I do not leave my house anymore. My garbage is piling up and I am too scared to step out my door. The only way I can get help is if I try to kill myself because only then people care Giving up trying to get help,Depression
15643,15663,What do you do when you are at your absolute lowest. I hate my job and I cannot think straight about what other job I want because I am always there. When I am not I just want to forget who I am and play games with my friends. I lost my love. My self worth is non existent. My therapist wants me to go on anti depressants as she is drained and thinks they will put fuel in my fire as I do not seem to have any. Haunted by things I want but cannot get like a decent relationship and someone that loved me and does not further hurt me. I just cannot get my shit straight. I am scared of the anti depressants. I am scared of my depression. I live for my family and just not to put them through pain. But I just cannot make any headway. I cannot feel good about myself or think yes I can. Only no I cannot. I am worthless and scared of everything.I feel like I am treading water. Delaying the inevitable one day at a time. Work.. work work bloody work.,Depression
15671,15691,If I was kidnapped and they said that You will feel love for 30 minutes. You will get that hug you have been wanting all your life. You will finally hold someone is hand. Someone will finally hold you in their arms. Then you will be swiftly executed I would take that deal in a heartbeat. Because this is literally the only way I would ever experience those things. I fucking hate myself. I would die to feel loved for half an hour.,Depression
15674,15694,I feel like I have tried every medication over the years. I was on Zoloft for a literal decade and have only just weaned off it and went onto Wellbutrin. I am also on Lamictal to stabilize my moods. However the Wellbutrin while it gives me energy is making me extremely short tempered and aggravated. I am going to talk to my psychiatrist in a couple days about adjusting my meds and might ask about a low dose of Zoloft along with the Wellbutrin but I just really do not want to be on three different mood meds at the same time. Has anyone been in this situation suggestions? Medication questions,Depression
15678,15698,before anything Id like to apologies for the rambely way I writeso hey I am Dan I am 26 and recently I have not been having a good time my last serious relationship ended about 2 years ago now and ever since then I have been lonely and these few months its gotten a whole lot worse I have depression and anxiety where I often have weeks where I stay inside and do not see anyone and most of all is that recently I have started to feel like a weird little ugly alien who nobody wants.I have been on dating apps and I have been on dates and even made some connections where I have made friendships but nothing really ever gets into something I would call a relationship and my last relationship ended with me getting emotionally abused every single day until I could not take it anymore and had to end thingsbut now I want to have a connection again and it feels like nobody wants me nobody cares about me in the way I care about them and I am not blaming them if anything its myself I hate myself because if nobody wants to care for me or want to get close with me I must be horrible no wonder my last partner was abusivejust this thinking has gotten into my head so much and I cannot go outside anymore because when I do I see couples who are happy and cuddling and kissing and laughing and enjoying life and I am alone and I always will be it feels like because I am damaged from when I was abused but I just want to be happy and it does not feel like it will ever happen to me again. I am so unhappy and lonely and I wish I was dead,Depression
15738,15758,Why do i hate happiness so much. I fucking hate laughter so much its so annoying. I hate everything happy. Why cannot the world just be normal. Maybe it is because I hate not being able to see what is happy in situations. I cannot fucking process anything in my shitty brain. Why is going to the beach so fun? Why do people like to be tanned? It hurts to fucking badly. what is fun about having children? what is fun about staying up late? Why do not people have routines it is so much easier. I cannot fucking live like this. I have no memories of me being happy as a child and I fucking hate it. Why is my family so fucking annoying and do not bother trying to understand me? Why do people like romance or comedy?Today I was at the beach with my mum and brother and they were having 'fun'. But me I was sitting in the tent fucking crying cos it is too hot for me to do anything. It was so fucking noisy I hate it all. I am such a fucking disappointment. Why was I born. Why?,Depression
15747,15767,I woke up today and after feeling slightly better for maybe six months I got a letter in the mail my insurance company is reevaluating my claim for longterm disability. I feel like I just went through their evaluation by other MDs a year ago and now they sent a whole package of information for me and my doctor to complete. I am so tired of being in pain everyday and struggling to get through a regular nonwork day. I lost my job because of mental and physical health and there is nothing to go back to. How can they do this evaluation again? What if my doctors do not say the correct things on the forms. What if my psychiatrist retires next year? I am shaking with fear because the only way I am surviving is on disability and I was ready to end my life before they took me out of work. I just cannot do it. I am so tired and afraid. I am shaking with fear and dread. I cannot feel this way again. Insurance Reevaluating Disability Any Experiences or Help?,Depression
15763,15783,I have not been this depressed in as long as I can remember. I just cut myself again. I have started to use drugs again. I am going down a dark hole and idk if I can get out this time Feel like this is my lowest low,Depression
15771,15791,Lately I have been fixated on my future especially a future with my partner. I am turning 14 this September and I am freaking out. I have been telling myself since I was 11 that I would kill myself before I turn 14. I was planning on actually doing it but things have changed. I am just beyond happy that I found someone who seems to perfect yet still loves someone as not perfect as me. he is been with me for a few months over a year and we tell each other everything. we have been talking about our future together like what our wedding would be like where our future home would be our future pets ect. I love the future we have created in our minds. I would do anything for that to be our reality. Lately I have been feeling almost normal. Like the pure pain of life is no more than a slight pinch. I still have those days that make me want to end everything but I have a lot of days where I am happy and excited for my life.I have not felt that way in a long time I am not sure what to do now.... What do I do know?,Depression
15808,15828,I had a breakdown put the cord around my neck but could not hold it. I am a loser through and through. I have given up. God please kill me. Please. I just realized I will most likely fail a class I need to begin my practicum. I am already two years behind everyone my age.,Depression
15811,15831,i know this is a common problem i have anxiety and depression and its really draining. i constantly beat myself up mentally when I am not doing something productive. i see all my friends doing things productive like working out etc. i just feel useless and lazy most of the time and i just want to lay in bed and watch netflix. its not that i do not have an interest in doing things that are productive my body just does not want to DO them am i being lazy or is it something else? i really struggle with motivation and energy any advice?,Depression
15819,15839,A little backstory me and my girlfriend I have gone through some things but we have been OK for a while recently I have been dealing with depression.My depression is like this I have depression where I can barely even speak I do when I am told just so I can go back to my room into my bed and watch movies I have not even turned on my bedroom lights that is a staple of my room I have been super tired lately where I just fall asleep I took a shower yesterday and I basically felt so tired and I could not even stay awake I cannot even pull myself together do you even form a sentence I have not even change clothes or cleaned up my bedroom from my sleepover because I felt so like what is the point I have not even looked for my TV remote to use my TV I just want to use my phone to watch thingsI basically only had instant noodles today and I did not even finish that I went downstairs for that and water and only downstairs to do things my mom asked so I can quickly go back to my bedroom and be depressedI told my girlfriend about it and she basically said we had the same depression when for a fact I know we do not she goes out and gets drunk with her friends she is surrounded by family that gets to help her and cares when I am surrounded by family that just keeps to themselves most of the time she gets to have all these supportive friends to text and everything well the only two people I get that are my best friends do not really ever talk to me I do not really show that they care about my mental healthI just feel like me and her do not deal with depression in the same way And it kind of upsets me how she claims we do when were the fact we do not I just do not know how to feel or what to do I just feel really heard that she would claim we have the same depression Told my gf abt my depression trys and says we have same depression,Depression
15820,15840,Ok so I am a bit down about a different thing that Ill eventually process and get over once I clear my head so I am going to go for a long drive. I have been wanting to do some driving for a while but I never felt like it until today. Time to do some more exploring and not think about anything! Clearing my mind,Depression
15825,15845,I constantly feel isolated from everyone in my life. I feel like nobody really cares about me no matter how much they say they do. How do you guys deal with the feeling of being alone?,Depression

I am so miserable I hate my life. I have been hiding away in my room for 5 years now straight only going to the store to grab food and come back. I do not go anywhere because i know people can smell me. Every birthday i had I sit in my room and cry. I went to the doctor and they think I am lying because my test comes back negative. but you know when you smell and other have told me I smelled as well including family. I just want a normal 21 year old life.. go out have fun get drunk party hook up have one night stands you know ? I never been in a relationship and I want too so badly because I feel like I need human connection because I feel myself slowly slipping away each day. and it sucks because I am actually pretty not to sound conceited because I did not even realize how pretty I was until people told me. I just hate this so much. No one understands no matter how much i shower I feel disgusting I have a stench so bad that I had to quit my job because my coworkers was talking about me. i literally smelled like poop. I cried everyday coming home from work and it was a really good paying job. Sorry if this is so long and I doubt anyone will read this but I really needed to let this out because I am so tired and miserable I am crying as I type this. I want to work a job I want to have friends I want a normal life but nothing is working. I spend all of my money that I do get on different home remedies to cure bv. I literally overdrafted my bank account 300 just so I can buy things to help my bv but nothing does. I do not want to be like this forever and I am sad that I will. Bv is making me depressed,Depression
15862,15882,I excel academically I am in one of the best universities in the world I am very socially active and I have a lot of friends I do not have a gf but I have no problem with girls I know I am liked. Then why the fuck do I still dread every day. Why do I want to die why do I have suicidal thoughts every fucking day. I cannot do this shit anymore. Why am I depressed? Why do I want to kill myself?,Depression

I have never had this bad of a depressive episode in a long while. I cannot lean on the person I had for emotional support anymore and I do not know what to do anymore Please I need help is someone there to talk? how do you deal with relapsing,Depression
15900,15920,I do not want to live and nothing helps. I wish the world would understand than torture us like this. I wish there was a system through which we are allowed to kill ourselves than doing it outselves I do not know I wish people who did not have a purpose or do not know what to do with their life should be allowed to give up their lives,Depression
16046,16066,Hi I want to preface this by sayimg I have not been active in this community for reasons. But I just wanted to share this today.I cleaned my room yesterday not completely though but enough to give me a bosst to finish it.More importantly tho I cleaned my bed.I have not slept in ot for almost half a year and half a year in like a fourth of my bed.Well now I had my first skepp in a clean bed all to myself. And I woke up and I have not felt this good in a while.So bottom line is that a good nights sleep can change a lot. Sleeping in a bed,Depression
16059,16079,I wish I was not born human but rather an animal.Animals do not have to pay bills or slave their life just to gather enough money to retire and travel. Animals are not stressed about payments. They are free to explore and live as they please. Yeah they have predators but I would still rather fear that then my future of my mundane life.Not only that but screw people. When a bear or tiger sees you you know it is intentions It wants to eat you. When you see a deer you know it wants nothing to do with you. With people you never know their true intentions. People are more cruel then animals. Yes there are a few good people in this world but it is the equivalent of swimming in poop while rarely finding a diamond.Animals also usually do not experience anxiety or depression. Most cases of them having those illnesses is because of being in captivity by humans. I wish I was not born human.,Depression

16075,16095,I am alone. I am lost. I am confused. But most of all I am feeling sad. I feel no purpose in life. It is a burden to wake up everyday and be here. I want to go. I need help,Depression
16079,16099,Planning your life what career to persue which path to follow how to connect and socialise with other. Hopeing to find people who can understand and relate.I am feeling so hopless and lost right now. I thought I figured out my purpose what I want to do with myself in this life. But I have been knocked back down into the pit of despair obstacles thrown in my path obstacles be ongoing health issues.The friends I do have barely talk to me anymore. I put it down to living in different parts of the country plus adult life crap.I am jobless because of health issues.I constantly feel angry fed up and when I do have motivation to work on becoming a content creator nobody on my social networks share or interact.I am learning to become a life coach since I figured I have gone through a load of shit maybe I could help people l let them know they are not alone. But how am I meant to do that when my social skills or networking skills are crap and no one cares etc.Right now the only thing I think I can do is just take each day as it comes focus on activities that bring me joy.And just give up on being part of a system that clearly does not care for me.Damn human need for some kind of gratification to feel accepted by others.I have always been the odd one out on the outside looking in never invited out etc.Why do I keep trying to be part of a society that does not care nor want someone like me.To live a human life is to live a suffering existence. Is there any point in planning...,Depression

I want to stop these thoughts I want to be happy and have nice thoughts please someone help me please help me help me help me help me help me HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME A rant I wrote in my diary app today I am ok I just needed to vent,Depression
16106,16126,As my mental health deteriorates my lmaos get longer lmaoooooo. that is true!,Depression
16116,16136,I have a family and friends but cannot help but feel alone. I do not know if you guys feel the same way but I do not really have anyone I can open up with. It used to bother me but right now what is the point. It feels pointless and void of any meaning to try and feel sadness. I want to scream but the sound does not come out. I cannot tell if I have lost something or if I never had it. I have been called heartless and rude but I do not react anymore its like its become a part of my character I have grown devoid of it. Sorry for the rant I need to get it off my chest. Loneliness,Depression
16127,16147,Never thought I would do this because I should not feel this way and I have no right to cry.I am a married guy in his early 40s with a wonderful child who I love.My sexless marriage has been difficult due to my partner's serious mental issues and over the years this has pushed me right up to and sometimes beyond my limits. Most of the time I have coped until...I met a girl at work and we flirted and teased one another a lot over a period of months. I fell in love with a girl who I cannot have and truth be told does not want me. she is another trian crash but has awoken feelings in me that I have not seen in so many years.We ended up getting very drunk at a recent night out and we kissed which messed with my head even more. I left my job to escape this situation but the problem is that every waking minute of every day I think of and long for her but know that it is wrong. Heartbroken on so many levels. Rebooting,Depression
16131,16151,I am not sure if its just me but I feel the weekends are the worst. I like that I do not have school but I am just reminded that I do not like where my life is at the moment. I am lonely as hell right nowand I am trying to pick up the pieces of a recent episode I had. I was not really able to study and I am sure I just failed my most recent exam. My room is a mess cannot get myself to get up and put away clothes and dishes. Its the loneliness that is really getting to me. I got sent home from college and I do not really know many people in my hometown. My friends are busy live away from me or in relationships. Its the weekends I notice that I spend most of my day in my room. I have a huge void in my day because I broke up with my boyfriend last week. I did not realize how much of my day I spent talking to him but even before that we could only talk at certain times. He was horrible emotionally abusive at times but I miss him. I am just struggling to get my life back on track. My meds help with some symptoms but not enough to help me get through the day. I went to work today so I am proud of that. Anyone else find the weekends to be difficult Weekends are the Worst,Depression
16147,16167,Hi all. I have both depression and anxiety. My mind is always at war with itself. I am constantly overthinking everything. I am an avid music lover. I love to listen to music constantly. I have to have the volume of whatever I am listening to super high though. It drowns out all of the overthinking. You can overthink things if you cannot even hear you own thoughts right? Sometimes if I am overthinking too much at bedtime I can only fall asleep to loud music in my headphones. It probably is not the best for my ears but it is what it is. Does anyone else relate? Constant need for loud music to drown out thoughts.,Depression
16172,16192,Some are legitimate but other times its just because its easy to tell your disabled son that hes the reason for everything going wrong now! Its so hard living with someone who takes every situation out on you,Depression
16175,16195,I am struggling..... hardcore with SI and obsessive thoughts along with the return of my eating disorder. I want to quit my job binge drink and take copious amounts of medications. Find ways to get high and have fun before I die. I am not happy. I have tried to reach out to people and talk but its just not working. They do not get it they tell me to pray or my life is perfect soandso is so much worse off. They do not know my constant battle with calories and wanting to drive my car into the concrete barrier or taking the whole bottle of pills vs 1. Every God damn day. I am not in a good place even though everything from the outside looks perfect,Depression
16186,16206,I was on Zoloft for about 2 years. I just recently tapered off of it. I stopped taking it for good early June. Lately I have been feeling so empty. Like something in me is just missing. Nothing makes me happy. I try so hard to do all the right things. I am a psychology major so Id like to say I know what to do. I just cannot make myself do it. I have these bad thoughts in my head that in try to suppress but they keep coming back up. Does anyone here relate and can give some advice on how to feel better? Thanks in advance Reoccurring depression or personality trait?,Depression
16187,16207,I really need someone to tell me its going to be okay. I really need someone to tell me its going to be okay. I feel really lonely tonight. Extra lonely and scared and existential. Its eating me up. I want to cry. Scared and Lonely,Depression
16273,16293,The world felt less complicated when I was depressed and stuck in bed and in my own head. Idk,Depression
16312,16332,How do you guys figure out your in an episode? I find out like 2 months maybe even more after it started and wish I could know right when it starts so I am not such a grinch to everyone without knowing itIt would also be nice to know when it happens because then you can be proactive from the start about fighting back against it Knowing when your falling back into a depressive episode?,Depression

If I start to lose weight instead of maintain I will have to eat more. But so far it is been maintaining.I wanted to share for those of us who are too depressed to cook shop get out of bed etc. I should note I was looking to maintain weight at 12 body fat male with optimal nutrition taking 30 minutes total or less per day for everything shopping from vehicle to house cooking washing drying eating drinking trash etc.. I read online that the average American spends 105.8 minutes per day on these tasks. I am at about 30 minutes a day.This has worked for me so far. Thought I would share. and yes I realize Aquafina water vs tap water could save a lot of money but I wanted to easily measure ounces of water and thankfully I can afford 16.31 per day for everything nutrition combined. Plus I am too depressed for anything for washingdrying dishes..I currently have no dishes to washdry everyday which is nice. Everything that is not Fridge can be thrown in my backpack. So it is very convenient for storage as well. I look forward to healthier blood panel results in 152 days time. Depression but did visit Registered Dietician,Depression
16365,16385,I am sick of feeling worthless and inferior and battling the same old negative thoughts everyday. I carry around so much guilt and shame even for shit I am not responsible for. I care so much about what others think that it feels oppressive. I often think that killing myself is the right thing because it would mean one less worthless person from a worthless background on the earth.I do not feel love or liked by anyone. I do not even think I am capable of being so. Anyone can take one look at me and know I am inferior. Who would settle for me? Who would befriend me? I am the lowest man on earth.I just want this to end. I have cried so many times. I am going to therapy. Sometimes I feel okay but then it seems to get worse. I am sick of feeling like shit everyday,Depression
16372,16392,Feeling so incredibly overwhelmed this past week. The past 89 months I have been so fucking depressed. It began with moving to a new city hoping it would be a 'new start' and a change of pace. But ever since I have moved I have felt isolated like I have never felt before. I do not understand the people in this new city. The job that got me to move has been unbearably frustrating and has some what put a hold on me life. How? I do not even know. I do not have friends or family here. I have never been so isolated in a crowd of people. I do not even enjoy been up during the day. And the worst issue is I do not know how to talk to my family about things that are stressing me out. The rage frustration and loneliness is all bottled up inside and I do not know how to deal with it. The one thing I could always rely on to help with my depression is the main thing causing my depression. Honestly do not know how to deal with it anymore. If anyone has suggests that would be greatly appreciated. cannot seem to catch a break.,Depression
16402,16422,I want to live in a world where money does not exist. A world that does not have a price tag stuck on everything I need. I hate society I hate standards I hate the government and I hate how our lives solely revolve around rules laws and money. I hate this world. I wish I was born as a wild animal. I wish I could live a life where I could be truly free.I do not want to worry about finances and taxes. Like a wild animal I want to worry about survival. I want to worry about the predators that could attack me at night and the weather that could destroy my home.I just want to be free. Humans made life so complicated,Depression
16420,16440,I think I just had what they call a nervous breakdown. I got triggered by a slight disagreement with my wife and then I absolutely exploded. I ran to the bedroom and cried intensely for at least three hours. Probably the worst I have ever felt emotionally so now I am dealing with the feeling of guilt plus knowing I let down my wife and kids by not going to a birthday party with them. My wife is confused and doesent understand what happened and I am not really sure myself. My best guess is it from stuffing emotions and I had finally just hit my limit Just had a breakdown,Depression
16459,16479,I am tired of having a legal guardian complete control over me because of my mental problems that apperently make me completely incompetent. And living in a facility for disabled.My fear is that I have to live like this forever. And makes me depressed because I am basically a prisoner.So what should I do to break free or not going crazy about it? What do I do?,Depression
16467,16487,I have always been an introvert I rarely do something for getting noticed from people I just mind my own businesses and nothing else but in the last times I have been pretty depressed. I have a fried that is 4 years younger than me but he is basically better than me in everything he is slim while I am a fatball he is smart while I am definitely not I risked of not passing school this year and he has a social life while I always stay in my house playing video games because I have nothing else to do in my shitty life my dad said that my sensibility is a good thing that others do not have but let me ask this what does sensibility give you in life? Where does it bring you in life? I have nothing good my grandma died this year my dog died last year the girl I love friendzoned me I always believe everyone I know hates me I am a stupid obese who does not care for nothing but playing videogames why cannot nothing in my life be good? I know nothing in life is easy but I really cannot take this anymore I sometimes hate my life,Depression
16473,16493,For the past 4 years I have felt either flat out nothing or panic. I do not know what is wrong with me so I would like to get checked out. Yet I am just a minor and I really do not want to make my parents upset. Back in middle school I harmed myself. Not too long after my parents discovered self inflicted cuts. They asked me what I was so upset over. I could not answer them. The truth is I could not really pinpoint what made me do it. I lied and told them that people were talking behind my back. They did not really take it seriously. They just told me that I should be grateful because I had a roof over my head and a good family. The school therapist did see me a few times but it did not help at all. If anything it made me feel ashamed of myself. Even earlier on a teacher thought I had ADHD because I showed little interest in class. My parents ignored it. Everyone thinks I am doing well off because I get good grades and I am good at faking a smile. In reality i do not know how much longer i can take any of this. I either feel nothing or intense dread at times. I am constantly hoping that time will pass in the blink of an eye. I am working so much that I feel like I am on autopilot. I do not feel like myself. I do not even remember what my personality is supposed to be like. I barely have any friends but i think they are losing interest in me too. What should I do? Any advice helps. Thank you. How do I ask a family member for help?,Depression
16489,16509,God I am a wreck at the moment. My mind is just racing. My bf is away this weekend with friends and was texting and checking how I was. I said I was not good but not to worry and sorry for being a burden. He said I am not a burden and he can come home early if I needed. I just burst out crying!! Anyone else very emotional at the moment? Just had a bit of a cry earlier!,Depression
16493,16513,After having a great month then dipping and talking to friends about it I felt like a foolburden and decided to just tell people I am better again. But I am not. Some days are better than others. I am still seeing my therapist but I am really trying hard to not burden my friends anymore. I want to talk to my friends and tell them the truth.. but I am trying to so hard to be strong and get people to have normal conversations. I understand people are busy.. but then why they do not respond I start overthinking I have lost friends because of my depression. Mind you I just golfed with one of my closest friends yesterday and have more things planned. Yet.. I feel so ignored today. Fake being okay.,Depression
16498,16518,SelfFulfilling Prophesy The sociopsychological phenomenon of someone predicting or expecting something and this prediction or expectation coming true simply because the person believes it will and the person's resulting behaviors align to fulfill the belief.I have a lot of anxiety about the upcoming immigration to from Russia to Israel where my parents live now and I have been feeling afraid that I would be denied entry after I have done all the work they asked. I have been chatting about it with my gaming friends for a while which would calm the nerves a bit. But I have been feeling angry at my gaming friends today. We used to be tight when I was in the you.S. being in the same time zone made it easier to play games together than it does now. Our little group helped us get through the pandemic as we would get online every night and play PUBG Apex Destiny and many other games we tried over the year. And our little group grew first it was just the three of us now it is seven. We also knew most of each other IRL so we would hang out at a bar or play DampD together.When I moved back to Russia in April I used to ask them every day if they will be on because I have got no other socializing going on for me except for family. Every day I would wake up at 7 AM on my time just to speak with my friends. I would spend a couple of hours with them before they would peel off to sleep and then spend the rest of the day anxious about immigration.But as the time went on I started to get less and less responses. I would ask in our chat if people were planning to be online in the evening while it was still morning over there just to make sure that everyone got to reply. Also so I would get ample time to see their answers to know when I should wake up. Initially I would get many confirmations then less and less then people stopped answering consistently. Eventually I would feel lucky if I got so much as a no. The distance separated us. Over time they have become busier with jobs picking up after COVID mandates lifted with new partners just life. I however regressed I am alone or more accurately feeling alone I got no job I separated with a girlfriend of 7 years because the distance and the uncertainty of whether I am coming back to America and when made our relationship impossible. Chronic depression became more consistent. I started to realize that I was angry at them for moving on for finding people closer to them to spend time around for hanging out together without me. I started blaming myself for feeling angry and upset that I was not getting the socializing I needed. I have had my depressive episodes and they have offered support over chat which was a nice gesture. But I realized that I was angry because they said They were there for me except the times when I needed them. I cannot blame them for not noticing that me asking if people are online in the evening is a cry for help. That I am desperate for human contact other than my family members that I am forced to live with because I have nothing else in Russia. That I feel alone in a crowded room.I feel lonely. I feel unwanted. I feel unattractive. I feel like I am nobody. I feel like I have got nothing to offer. I feel let down because I have let myself down.I had a dream about living in the you.S. till the day I die.I LOVED living in the you.S.I feel like I have let myself down because I had not fought harder for my right to be there. Because I have not explored more options for stay. Because I did not participate in the Green Card lottery consistently. Because I did not save money to go to Grad School. Because I did not confront the Executive Director of the facility I worked at as a Counselor when he denied my request for a work visa which they did sponsor for past employees.During these 8 years I have learned the language almost to perfection I got a college degree I have worked I have got a B.A. in Psychology I worked again I asked politely to let me work longer. I did everything right. And it was still not enough.In my academic life I have felt like I was barely passing that I was procrastinating and not doing enough. I feel like I do not deserve both of my degrees. In my work life I feel that I was lucky I got my job and that I did not deserve it. That I was not doing more than I possibly could even though some days I would work for 15 hours straight during a pandemic ears red from the facemask loops then falling into my bed halfdead after driving home for an hour so that I could be up in another two to do it all over again.And still I feel let down because I believe I let myself get kicked out of the you.S.And now I sit in the apartment in Russia struggling to send out the paperwork for the Israeli immigration because I am afraid I am going to fail at that too. I choose not to act because I do not want to disappoint myself again. And it will come true because knowing all of this is not enough motivation for me to do something about it.So all I got left is the feeling of anger at the people who cannot play with me no more.

16516,16536,I am on a family trip in New York and I forgot my medication. I had gone back onto it a week prior to the vacation but forgot it while packing. I do not get home for another week and I am already miserable. I feel devoid of energy and life and am so frustrated with myself. I leave for college in a month and feel like I am wasting my final days. On top of this I am going through sort of a breakup and I already feel like an emotional burden to my friends and family. I have journaled but I have nowhere else to go for help. My last journal entry was suicidal and I am just very dissapointed in how pathetic I am. I am so fucking depressed,Depression

16625,16645,I know we talked about it before. But what if when I need you every time but you are too lazy to dealing with my problems then its pointless. Because you do not understand what I feel and you are just pity me like I am a homeless dog. When you want to give it the pity you give it. When you are lazy you ghost. Its not called helping. Its called giving alms and this thing is up to your emotions. Its like I begging your alms and I even have to considering your mood. I do not need your pathetically fake sympathies. DO NOT EVER EXPECT TO ANYONE SAVING YOU. Do not expect anyone to saving you,Depression

16794,16814,My 30F partner 34M is depressed. Triggered by some new personal stressors that I do not want to get into as it is personal to him. I am reading about how I can help and have heard all the general comments on setting small goals encouraging small daily rituals supporting therapy andpr medication etc. We are already pursuing medicalpsychological assistanceI would really like to know if anyone has some small anecdotes about how you have been helped in small little ways by someone else. Nothing grand just little gestures that meant something to you. I know I cannot cure him by being nice and I do not expect to I just want to make his day as easier as I can. Thank you in advance Would you share an anecdote of something a support person did that you appreciated?,Depression
16795,16815,there is something that makes me depressed but in order to change that I would have to earn money problem is that my depression prevents me from taking action and looking for an opportunity. How can I motivate myself for something while being depressed? I get older each day and feel like I waste so much time but at the same time I feel like I just cannot do anything against it. I am depressed about something and cannot change it.,Depression
16798,16818,Now I get to spend all my fucking time with my abusive parents and never get no chill nor sleep because of them. they will think of anything that Ill hate and make me do it all day every day.Yesterday was literally the one and only best day of my life because I got to celebrate my birthday which was originally on Monday with my closest friends. We smoked some weed listened to music chilled and even freestyled for hours on end. It was the best day of my life but of course it had to end on it. that is it. Back to my usual everyday shit. Therapist are not shit. Parents on their shit again. Everything is back to normal. Summer holidays just started and its only getting worse,Depression
16811,16831,Sup guys so I have had a funky time with mental health. After having a very fun depressive few months.. years on and off I really and I mean really want to get rid of this clingy stubborn crap stain of a companion.I have tried doing that by trying to enjoy life more. And you know I am really fucking happy to admit that I think I am almost there. But its like I am sitting on the edge of a cliff and when I look down I can see the type of person I want to be but becoming that person feels like I am going to have to jump off and here is why. I want to be able to wear clothes that look nice and make me feel nice when wearing them. I want to have a better relationship with my parents and sibling. I want to focus on my hobbies like art and writing. Start cooking and doing it more often instead of just eating cup noodles. I want to start enjoying train rides to cities looking at the Opera house at sunset meeting new people having lots of plants doing things that make me feel at peace. man I just really want to start enjoying life.But every time I do things that I have always wanted to do I remember why I did not do it before and what stopped me. Every time I wear clothes I am excited to wear I keep thinking how bad they look on me. I remember looking through my clothes and putting together outfits I might be able to wear if lockdown gets any better but after every outfit deep down I did not like how my body looked on all of them. I have gained weight and it feels even worse when my mum comments on how fat I look. I am 57 kilos and 163 cm which might be chubby but personally would not go on to say I am fat yeah know? however to my mum it is beyond every time I come to have a conversation with her she comments on my weight my hair my looks. I remember she used to comment a lot on my grades but after I got A's and made it into a competitive school she stopped and went on other things the constant shame of grades had driven me into trying so damn hard at school thinking maybe if I get better grades my mum will get off my back. But its as if the more I try to make her proud the more ways she finds to get disappointed. But she is my mum she is toxic sometimes but I know that she cares and certain times she shows it. but it is hard. it is hard having conversations with my family. There so.... strict and hard to talk to. So judgemental. So overdramatic. Whenever I talk to them I get reminded why I did not. My mum always says I am just avoiding my family I say that I am busy but the truth is I just want to have a nice time with them but I am scared. I am scared that they will say something mean and either ill have to pretend it does not bother me just to maintain peace or ill let it get to me and get emotional. Whenever I do art write poems do things that I like I regret doing it because I simply do not have time. I barely have time. School takes up most of my time it is like I have no free time. Every time I do have free time I study. Study study study. Even though I am well aware it will not mean anything to my parents. it is like second nature. I cannot stop thinking about school. I go tutoring in the city so aesthetic train rides to the city? Yeah reminds me of all the hours I spend on Saturday doing math. it is just that. When I start getting better all I can see are my flaws. I am emotional a workaholic stressed all the damn time insecure. I get so disappointed Soon enough before I know it. All the motivation I have to get better disappears. And I am back to square one. I think one of the first steps to getting better is understanding I am very flawed but what after? And how do i get past this? I want to get better for myself for my mum to stop worrying about me so i stop getting annoyed at my little brother being a bother to my friends. I really want to stop hating life because to be honest I have got so many good things i want to look forward too so many good people i love. Yet deep down i always get worse i always get dissapointed i always get fucking tired of life all over again I want this time to last. How do i look at my flaws and not hate myself and get depressed all over again? How can I look at my flaws and still be... ok?,Depression
16849,16869,Over the past couple of years I have been suffering from loneliness. My immediate family who I live with were made aware of this by me after I admitted to them I had felt suicidal this was near the end of 2019.Fastforward to now and although I spend most of my time with my immediate family which helps me out I still suffer strongly from loneliness as I only have one friend who tends to be busy but we hang out occasionally.I have a deep desire for a deep and meaningful connection someone I can call a close friend who I can trust and also a partner I can spend time with.This loneliness is emotionally damaging to me as I am seeing an abundance of content online on TV YouTube etc. where people are happy with their friends andor partners and here I am wanting someone to call a friend or partner to be happy.I am trying to meet new people but I cannot find any meetup groups of young people like myself who share my interests. I will not open up to my family due to feeling a sense of being pathetic embarrassed for my lack of social life and because I do not want their pity or to be treated differently.I just feel stuck and hopeless now and this drives my thoughts of suicide and misery.All I want is someone to talk to that is not my family but I also feel like my feelings are not valid because I have not tried everything. Loneliness is emotionally painful,Depression
16852,16872,I know it may sound clich but I am just tired of living the way I am. I cannot even change anything in my life because I fear my mums reaction. I have been thinking of running away but I would probably get hauled back home by cops and just ruin my life further. At this point I do not want advice I just want someone to even pretend to understand me but I do not think that anyone cares enough. I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up... I am just so tired of everything,Depression
16891,16911,I do not know where to start I am 22 no real friends only a few girlfriends but the last few years of my life I have felt so low I keep trying to motivate myself to do things like playing football doing MMA for instance or just generally exercising but when I am in the heat of the moment I just feel so lost and helpless. I do potter around with the devil's lettuce now and then but it helps me sleep at night or get through the day when my mind is in an overdrive of thoughts of what I should be doing with my life what my peers are doing how successful they are compared to me etc. I work alongside my dad so that does not help in pushing me along really every time I see an opportunity I do not go for it like I should do I just go to work sulk all day come home and smoke weed till I fall asleep that is no life for a 22 yo but it is the way it is and I cannot seem to break the cycle I do appreciate that I have a loving family etc I just want to make them proud and be happy for once in my life . Any advice is greatly appreciated. Lost,Depression
16892,16912,I have realised the root because of the problem after countless hours of thinking and from now its only going to be a race to get ever better. I hope I come back to this subreddit to post that I am finally out of it in the coming months. I made and deleted 3 diff accounts to post here. I am finally going to get myself together because nobody else can I hope you all make it too and let us race to finish line!ironic but had to say it lol Would like to recommend a song to you all Avicii ft Alunageorge What would I change it to.Beautiful Verse Losing is only a sign a sign that you really really tried really tried. Take care amigos Godspeed! I THINK I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT!,Depression
16905,16925,is not that the saying? Or at least some form of it ? Being in the middle of life ans trying to make friends or relationships seems to be my perfect hell. No matter what strategy or style I try it fails . My life this past month has been nothing but a spiraling out of hell from my mothers cancer diagnosis to my grandmothers passing nothing seems to work out . I get that everything happens for a reason but why do some of us get the short stick every time ? It just make me want to give up on trying . Trying for a better love a better life a better outcome . I know that is not how I was raised but something has to give .were born alone and we die alone so why keep with the waiting game and just do it now ? I know this is an empty plea but would someone give me a reason not to ? Were born alone we die alone,Depression
16915,16935,I am so utterly miserable i cannot help but see the world in black amp white and how miserable the rest of society is around me nothing is appealing about the 95 suburban lifestyle there is no way anybody actually wants this right? we just settle for it because were convinced that is the only way to make it in this world. i hold onto this little bit of hope that ill get out of the cycle and live the life i want to at some point but i fear until then ill never find satisfaction or an appeal to living. life is fucking short and its a hard thing to accept once you realize it I am constantly chasing after time. if i do not make it out of here by 30 i genuinely do not see myself continuing to stay alive. this is impossible,Depression
16934,16954,Hey you all. I just discharged from the psych unit today after about 4 days of voluntary hold. it is hard to sum the experience up fully but to put it simply it was beautiful. I met some amazing people who were struggling right along side me. These people will forever precious to me. I was prescribed medication and I am feeling a bit better already going through the weirdgettingusedtoit phase. Overall I feel that the visit gave me a new perspective and a renewed desire to live. To anyone feeling like they are at the end of what they have do not be afraid to reach out for help. We can get through this tunnel together. Your life is precious and honestly it is worth a trip to the ER if you are feeling ready to give up. There is hope and there are people who care about you and want to help you. Please do not be afraid of getting help. Thank you guys for always being there throughout these years shit has been rough but I feel like I am finally on the path to crawling my way out of this. A small spark of hope,Depression
16975,16995,I used to be a brat in middle school only wanting to play games and run around. My grades were terrible and I was always a sidekick looking for the popular kids to accept me. One day that changed. I was in chemistry class we were learning about atoms and I became very intrigued and it suddenly snapped. I was no longer that brat I became more reserved felt more conscious and aware of things heck I never studied but went on to graduate high school on top of my class. I was no longer the same person. I was very ambitious in high school. I wanted to be a scientist or an engineer work for NASA and be a part of all those amazing projects. As I progressed through high school however my life slowly started going downhill and I became very depressed and suicidal.I have aphantasia so I cannot really imagine anything so some things are a lot harder for me when it comes to studies. However that is not the reason my life was ruined in fact I did not really care much about that.I never had any real friends I have general anxiety puberty fucked me in the ass I realized life is not fair and so on. I mean can you imagine how hard it is for a high schooler at the peak of his youth to get back hair hyperhidrosis and a bunch of other things. I was always made fun of for having excessive body hair I did not mind it much but back hair is a new beast entirely. Every other dream I have I feel exposed anxious I can almost hear everyone making fun of me and casting me out. I suppose this stole my youth and that is where I got very existential. We are not born equal we only die equally I told myself. If there is no God and life is all about randomness then I drew an awful straw and wasted my one shot at life If there is a God then why did he do this to me? I quickly became an absurdist and then a cynical nihilist. Depression tore me apart every night I would think about suicide. However I was still hopeful I studied for the university entrance exam daily failed my first choice spectacularly and then realized how choices mattered. If I woke up earlier and studied in middle school got into a better high school that was math heavy I would have passed. Anyway I failed another exam and finally got accepted to study physics. I loved physics so I thought why not? Although my first 2 fails really shattered my confidence. I started out okay but I felt like the odd one out in my class mainly because my end goal was suicide and In this room there were many with great ambitions. I could not focus on classes because of this anxiety but I still went to lectures. I was dying already and not even a semester had passed. The work load was too much and my only goal was suicide. Because of the obvious lack of motivation I dropped out and my parents subjected me to mental torture in the coming months. I have an awful sleep schedule and go to bed at 10 am not because I am on my phone or something but because I am overthinking and despairing too much to fall asleep.Nowadays I am a shutin neet just waiting for an opportunity to die. I have some thoughts of just changing forgetting about everything getting a job living a different life than the life I have always wanted but I do not see myself overcoming this I guess a big part of me just does not want to. If I did not have empathy I would have killed myself ages ago. Thanks for reading this long and boring post. From a life of ambition to a dead end,Depression
16990,17010,Just wondering if anyone has gotten past that part where they just want to disappear from everything even memories and become nothing? It feels like this part is never going to end and its killing me with people saying it gets better or you learn to handle it better over time. Gotten past the want to disappear part?,Depression
16992,17012,In September I was finally planning a wedding with my SO the person depressed of 3 years. He spent weeks picking out the perfect ring and he even picked out a house to buy for us. He was going to put the deed in both of our names but take on the loan in his own since I did not graduate with my doctorate until this May. Fast forward to February when his family fell apart when his Dad and his best friend other than me hurt his mom in addition to other difficulties in his life not involving me. It was like someone flipped the switch off in his brain. He said he felt numb. Like a piece of him died inside. It continued to get worse until it felt like he hated me. He said mean things would hang out with people he never hung out with before and seem truly happy but when he got home he was emotionless again. He did not talk. He lost interest in sex and if we did have sex it felt cold and emotionless. He assured me he still loved me but it did not feel like it anymore. In the first week of May he seems to perk up and finally opened up about feeling depressed and I left for 2 nights to go visit family and he went right back to numb. I texted him and went off because I could not take it anymore and asked him to fight for me but he said he could not. A few days later he told me we fell out of love. I recently heard about anhedonia and it seems consistent with a lot of his sudden actions and ability to have excitement with only some people. I do not expect to get back together but some kind of understanding of an issue that I do not understand or personal experiences would be appreciated. I am struggling but in a different way. I tried to be enough but I regret not realizing he may have needed professional help. I know this is for those with depression but I could use some advice,Depression
16993,17013,I am in my early 20s it seems like all people around me are extremely happy have a functional family a solid economic floor great friends a ideal relationship and they are living life like a fantasy. Why those people are happy and they have stability in all aspects of life?My soul at this age is consumed literally... I do not have social life since 7 years and get used to stay alone long periods of time in my room the weirdest part is that I reached such level that I do not use my voice anymore I prefer communicate in my own house with signs silence pact.I spend 68 hours everyday studying until burnout because I am pissed off I will not stop until complete my goal because this is the only thing that root me in the real world. My rage and deception of life is such deep that I suppressed my emotions years ago I converted my depression into pure angry 247 it is my only gasoline to continue my day forcing my brain to collapse to get a decent job and leave this hell called home. The problem now is that I am very furious and I contain all of this without leaving my mind I would like to punch a sand bag to reduce my stress.Right now you are reading this and you could see me but I am not here my mind left me years ago one day maybe Ill return when the things be better... for now I have to continue in this automatic strict routine. I would like to have friends to feel something but idk... I became a coldserious person. Today I make 7 years with depression try me bich.,Depression
17054,17074,I am not sure if I am living anymore or just taking up space. I wish I could find a purpose. Something... Anything to give myself a meaning to being alive. I know I should not be thinking such dark thoughts but I cannot help it anymore. Just let me drown for once. Let me fall apart. Stop caring for me just because I do not seem ok anymore. Truth is I have not been for a while. I have been holding onto every last thread within reach. I am TRYING TRUST ME I AM. but it hurts to breathe... do not you get it? IT HURTS.... so fking badly.... can someone just... pls ... hold me... bc i cannot anymore... floating.,Depression
17078,17098,that is it. I do not have friends anymore. My last friend got away from me when my depression got really bad last month. One by one my friends drifted apart from me when I was suffering.I never had a meaning for any of them. I feel alone. I wish I could obsess over something and not care about being alone. But it hurts. I wish I had someone to talk about random stuff.I am on antidepressants right now and the dose was increased so I am feeling a little numb not as depressed and suicidal as I was last week.I do not know what to do. I know no one is going to read this nor reply to this either. I do not even know why I am writing here. I am just crying for help. I do not have any friends.,Depression
17082,17102,New medication. Therapist going fine. Walking an hour a day. kind of doing everything.My therapist told me it seems that depression has become my purpose. And it is true. I have no point in living. I spend money and do not feel anything. I save money for what reason? To buy property? cannot do it in my hometown. cannot move either. cannot make more money at my job because I hate it.Women? My looks suck. Women do not like me. I can talk and carry a convo but my depression or looks scare them off. Which is fair. Suicide? Thought of it. A lot of ideation but nothing serious. I am just ... tired. I want to run to the end of my lifespan and die. I do not want to go through it anymore. If I could have a button and fast forward my life to the eventual last few hours I am not saying I would click it but I would hang onto it as an option.I do not want to do this anymore.

17101,17121,!!VENTING NOT ASKING FOR HELP!!For the past couple of months ever since I quit my job after having multiple crippling panic attacks at work I have been finding it hard to leave the house. it is gotten to a point where I just do not go outside anymore and hide away in fantasies my brain makes waiting to die. Before I tried getting jobs but I cannot hold any down and eventually just stopped trying. For the last 3 months I have been forced to see a therapist the drive there makes me physically ill and paranoid. I still have a hard time expressing to her how I feel in person but I cannot stop seeing her. She has ordered me to go to a doctor twice but I just cannot go.I have a very loving family but they are too loving and not in the ways that I need I have no autonomy or word in decisions made for me. I no longer have the will to argue. I cannot see a future for myself I had plans on moving out before I quit my job but now it is just a cold dream. These feelings are taboo in my family but my parents have been very patient with me until now. I think my mom just kicked me out. I have until Monday to pack to my things she said I am not upset or sad by this it is what I deserve. Not to sound like I am in my own self pity party but I was told that even if I am in such a dark place I still chose to be in the situation that I am in and really I cannot help but agree. How is it that others can still live their day to day lives but I cannot I cannot comprehend it.Anyways I think I am going to homeless but I cannot find the will to do anything about it. disappointed in myself,Depression
17106,17126,I feel trapped and I feel like I have lost myself. I am on here because honestly I have no one else to talk to about this. I have started to hate everything about me mentally and physically. I want to do good and do better but I honestly do not think I can. I cannot make anyone proud of me not even myself so I drown myself in work music movies and video games but honestly those only last so long and then here I am alone in my head again. Its like a personal hell being in my headspace and I just feel completely gone from the world and feel like everything is worthless and I will never amount to anything in my life. Idk what to do,Depression

17168,17188,Pretty simple. I have had depression among other mental illnesses for most of my life. Been in therapy for 78 years meds for 6 tried 56 different meds and they have worked with varying degrees of success. I started a job I really like two years ago. My depression has been getting steadily worse since...Marchish? In April I received a written warning about my performance forgetting things missing meetings etc. It got to the point that I spent most of June in a disassociate haze that culminated in going to the psych ward for 5 days june 30July 5 because I tried to kill myself. I was off for 5 work days. Two days after I came back from FMLA leave I was given a final written warning for my performance with all of the listed incidents happening the last two weeks of June. The ultimate kick in the crotch was the writeup was dated and supposed to be given to me the day I went to the hospital. I feel absolutely lost and confused. My supervisors know I was in the hospital my immediate boss knows off the record why I was in the hospital but I feel like I am being unfairly treated. I feel like if I came back and told them I had cancer they would not have written me up. Getting the writeup basically reset all the progress I had made in the hospital and I feel hopeless. I do not know what to do my therapist suggested I take FMLA to do PHPIOP or ECT but I am scared if I do they will fire me when I get back and I absolutely need this job for health insurance. Has anyone dealt with something like this before and what should I do? I was written up at work because of my depression and I do not know what to do.,Depression
17182,17202,I am so confused.... so I was talking with a friend I do not talk to anymore. he said he was raped and molested for 3 years. we started talking about my trauma... and I kind of realized I have all the symptoms I guess is a way to put it of getting rped... but I do not know...I guess I just find it hard to believe but it is possible...I cannot remember anything before like 8th grade I am going to be a junior this coming school year besides the fact that I had a friend and we had all of our classes together besides like 1 or 2 classes. anyway I am also either hypersexual or completely disgusted with it. and... I keep hearing kinks stem from childhood trauma not sure if that is true or not but I have some pretty hard kinks... for example cnc but... idk I never saw that like I possibly got rped... I just thought that was normal to not remember anything and are sexual in a way...and of course I do not want to say I have been because idk if that is true. I truly do not know so I cannot say anything. I guess it is finally time to talk about this... tw rpe amp slight sex talk,Depression
17255,17275,I am so done with my misery. I am tired. Tired going to bed every night. Tired waking up every morning. Tired listening to how fucking dumb i am every day. Tired looking for a job. Tired opening up to other people for them to just make fun of me or pretend that they care. Tired to tell myself only reason I am still alive is i do not want to destroy my brothers life knowing that my brother would not even care only real reason is me being a coward. Tired looking for a fucking reason in tomorrow...I do not know what to do. I do not know why even try.When i fell my friends my family showed their real faces. Showed how much they do not care. How much they do not want to deal with my shit. How much they just want me to leave...I wish i had the will to just end it. I am done. Take it away i do not want it...I wish I could just restart this fucking game. Just delete old saves and start over. I fucking wish.I hope everyone reading this have someone around during hard times. Everyone deserves it. I hope you are happy. Tired,Depression
17262,17282,Everyone has it easy everyone has it better everyone has a financial safety net and if they do not they probably at least have better earning potential everyone has a significant other everyone has a home and a bed everyone has a dog or cat they cherish everyone has no anxiety everyone has confidence. Except for me. I am all alone. That is how I feel. I feel like I am the only one suffering,Depression
17265,17285,Friends are few family would never miss me literally. My husband and I have grown apart. I am bored lonely and hate my life. I am 53 and completely disappointed. I want to know if I can literally escape and start a new life. Can I run away and start over?,Depression
17272,17292,Okay first of all I start by that my native language is not English and I am also really bad at tellingexplaining.So here it goes.As the title has suggest I do not know if I am living nor existing I am just here for with no purpose in the past few weeks it feels like that I am sitting in the void in an empty room whatever I do or want to do brings me down makes me exhausted and tired I try to enjoy the things that I think I like but it just will not do it anymore everything feels like a chore or even better said it feels like that I am just a mindless robot I wake up go to work come back home and that is it even if I try to go outside it does not feel like living. I have someone in my life that I have feelings for but lately I am asking myself whose feeling they are as if I would not be me. I am in a constant self hatred quilt shame and all sort of negative emotions. I have already written two letters one for her and one for my parents You guys know what I talk about and it is just getting difficult by the day to fight against it. I have been trying to get help but in the Area I am living in is almost impossible to find someone who is available and specialized in the type of therapy I need. It is a constant struggle and it just feels like what ever I do makes zero sense.I tried to explain it as good as I can I am sorry if most of you will not be able understand what I tried to write talking is not my strength at all. But I thank you guys for taking your time and reading it. I do not feel like if I am living nor existing.,Depression
17276,17296,I am scared that I am going to die alone or commit suicide before 30 if my life keeps going the way it goes. I am 19 currently never been in any kind of relationship socially anxious and all i do when I am not at work all i do is whack off and play video games i see fucking nothing in the future for me i have only a few friends and even they seem to just tolerate me instead of actually enjoying my company. i got medication about a year ago and they help from day to day but i still just feel hollow like nothing i do matters I have been getting my drivers license for the past fucking year because I am too scared of failing to actually try and do the test... I am just tired of this sometimes i wish it was me who died and not my brother but then i remember that he would probably be in my shoes if it was me who was gone and i would not wish that on anyone. I am terrified of the future.,Depression
17281,17301,Even though i have a diagnosis even though i know I am clearly not well mentally i still feel invalid because I am not completely at rock bottom. I still smile I still laugh I still feel joy. Every damn time I laugh at some stupid joke or something I immediately think why are you laughing? you are supposed to be depressed. you are a fraud you are an attention seeker you are a loser you are a piece of shit I feel like I am faking my feelings and I feel really bad about it. i feel invalid because i still feel joy,Depression
17290,17310,I dated someone I thought was finally the one for 6 months until he suddenly pulled away and ended things without giving me a reason. 3 weeks later my new job that I loved and just got a glowing review from superiors cut me loose because they hired a more experienced person for my position and did not need me. I was floored by both endings. The firing happened last week. Now I cannot stop crying cannot get out of bed and feel miserable and sorry for myself. I take meds but its not working. I feel like a loser. I have nothing now. Back in May I had the perfect boyfriend and job a d things were finally working out in my life after a lot of setbacks. Now I am back to square one and I am exhausted. I was laid off from my last job in Oct and was dumped by previous boyfriend last June. So 2 breakups and 2 job losses in one year. I am at the end of my rope. I am highly qualified in my field and I never had any work problems before covid. But working from home while going through a breakup a family member death and financial instability completely alone was making it harder to hit deadlines and it took a toll on my work performance. Neither company had any empathy towards its employees my co worker was fired a week after his mom died because he missed one deadline..because his freakin mom died. If that tells you the cutthroat nature of the field I am in. Still no excuses I take responsibility for not being my best. Does anyone have any uplifting stories or things to make me feel a little less hopeless? Got dumped and fired within 3 weeks and I feel despondent. Not sure what to do.,Depression
17293,17313,Not one childhood memory not tainted by the knowledge it ended in abuse. Not one romantic memory untainted knowing that everyone I kissed moved on to better people. I am so low I realized today that I do not have any memories untainted by sadness or worry.,Depression
17328,17348,I have done everything. I do skincare twice a day and have no acne I brush my teeth and floss I brush out the mats in my hair and keep it clean I exercise in the mornings I do yoga before bed I meditate I journal to vent I eat healthier I do my favorite hobbies and I do what I enjoy. But I still feel like shit.I am healthier now so much more than I was a year ago say but on the inside I still feel constantly tired. I have tried everything everyone recommends. I mean self harm is still an issue its an addiction after all but I am twenty days sober and am going weak but still going.Everyone is proud of me for making it this far but I am not. Everyday is a struggle to do it all and everyday I find it harder and harder to get out of bed. I do it for my pets and my hobbies and my friends. Its a momentary happiness but I feel plagued and exhausted once these tasks are done. I cannot relax because my brain fills up with those nasty disgusting thoughts again.I am also terrified because not even three months ago I was crying sobbing constantly and self harming like mad. I could not even bring myself to brush my teeth and my hair became impossible to brush. There was a period where I did not get out of bed for four days straight. Then my health declined to the point my dad finally took me to a doctor which was just a side effect of my depression. Nobody actually knows how mentally drained and exhausted I am. No one knows my mental illness that is constantly looming over me. I do not want to go back to that.I cannot take a break. Because once I do I remember it all. If I could just hop off a building and hit the ground then get up afterwards without dying Id be fine. Or if I could just die and wake up a year from now that would be amazing. it would be refreshing. But that is not reality.This feeling of weight pulling me into the ground and the constant tiredness and sore muscles will it ever go away? Will all of this go away some day and I can just be healthy like a normal person? I am doing everything right. I really am. Everyone is so proud of me. I just do not want to let them down. I just want to be normal. Even when I improve my habits and health the mental strain of depression never goes away. Will it?,Depression
17331,17351,I have been having more and more suicidal thoughts and I keep going through violent mood swings which just ends up hurting people I want to talk to mom about it but she is just going to send me to a mental hospital like she did with my sisters I cannot talk about my issues,Depression
17337,17357,I was bullied like almost everyone else and ever since life was different. I always thought there was a predefined mindset that I had to get myself to believe in to be happy like ''I do not care what others think etc.. But that is bullshit affirmations do not work and they will never work because they do not change anything in your life.Everything somebody else can do for you is give you an explanation on why your brain is the way it is. There are no supplements Affirmations meditations drugs Therapies that will make a significant change.If you do not physically change something in your life everything will stay the same.Being bullied left me in an unconsciouss shame state that followed me everywhere. what is the easiest and most reliable way to live with Trauma? Coping strategies. My coping strategies were Videogames and social media.The bad thing in your life are not the circumstances its how you react to them. Lock them up cope them away with addictions perform compulsions evade them at any cost will never ever change something.Be clever and start recognising what your coping strategies are and just do not commit to them anymore. No affirmations necessary your brain will sort things through by itself.Coping strategies are basically everything that make you feel good immediately your smartphone food drugs.... If you do not try to stop your coping then you are not allowed to ask for help in my eyes because you should know what to do.How can you heal in circumstances that made you that way?You will notice that your life might get very silent even lonely. But that is just the demons you locked away. You will learn to regulate your emotions again. Shame is the Key emotion why mental illness is so prevalent nowadays. This is how the sequence usually goesTraumagtShamegtcoping strategiesgtaddictionsgtdepression ocd anxiety borderline extreme narcissm... What your mental illness will be in the end depends on the person some might get ocd and do compulsive information seeking some might become grandiose narcissists and completely ignore their problem and just make it their daily life to get affirmation from others on social media.that is the thing about self esteem It does not need a reason.Narcissism always needs a reason mostly multiple times a day a. What does your brain need its emotional regulation for if you perform instant reward coping strategies instead? If you are as desperate as I was you should take my advice seriously. It will not be enjoyable but that is what life is like.What if instant rewards would have been accessible in ancient times? The people would not have evolved and would probably have died because nobody wants to work for long term goals if there are instant rewards. Everyone is responsible for their own mental health.Get off the internet use it only for important things. Buy an old Phone without internet. Move out of your parents house if you have not already. Learn to be alone with yourself again. Live for yourself. do not depend on other people for your happiness. If you do not help yourself nobody will because no one can anyways. What 99 of your problems are caused by,Depression
17443,17463,At first i did not know what it was i just felt empty sad lost interest in all of my hobbies nothing was fun to do anymore. I did not take it seriously probably just your teenager hormones messing around i told myself.I began searching on the internet for weeks and i eventually understood what it was fucking depression that is. Probably caused from many years of extreme shyness social anxiety and self isolation i was scared of people and i had no personality.I failed highschool 3 times it took me 6 years to finish highschool. In my 5th year of highschool 1920 years old i only had 4 subject to finish so i had pretty much 80 of free time the whole year. I promised myself i would get a job and actually be someone do something with my life. I failed got called for 6 interviews and i did not even attend 4 of them huge panic attacks last 2 were on a more discrete place with less people around so i eventually had the guts to go inside first one i had a panic attack right at the beginning interviewer seemed cool about it at let me take some deep breaths i went through the interview but he said at the end I am sorry but you should really consider seeking a therapist. Last interview i did sweat a lot i had a very shaky voice i was extremely anxious and could barely look at her in the eyes 5 minutes into the interview she says you are not really qualified for this job I am sorry and i left.After that day i hit the rock bottom a few months later i rested my forehead on a loaded shotgun for more than an hour trying to get the courage to pull the trigger but the only thing that came to my mind was my mom's reaction seeing me dead with my head blown out. I could not do it.Last year of highschool only 1 subject left and again could not even apply for a job my anxiety was getting worse and so was my depression. One day at 5 in the morning i decided this is it I am going to end it right now. I got into my car and drove to the nearest cliff by the sea huge 100m drop i just sat there on the edge for about 20 minutes trying to find a reason not to do it once again the only thing that i could think of was my mom's reaction. Eventually an old fisherman saw me and called the police i kind of got away saying i enjoyed sitting while looking at the sea and i do it nearly every morning.Got into university at 21 years old 2 years went by and just being occupied with something eventually kept my mind busy and suicide thoughts went away for once. Nowadays 23 years old 2 years of university went by still never had a GF or even a female friend i made 0 friends i still have 0 experience talking with women i have not had a female classmate since i was 16. I promised myself that university would change my life just like it does to many people once again i failed myself my social interactions got a lot better and people do not notice that much that I am weird but I am still shy as fuck.Summer holidays just began depression is growing again at a fast rate no one to go out with i have 3 friends from highschool but we go out like once a month at best my closest friend just got a GF so he only talks to me like once a week just for regular stuff. 2 weeks ago i spent most of the time searching for ways to peacefully kill myself without making too much of a mess i planned to jump of a 75m bridge into the water or maybe try again the 100m cliff and also thought about taking a bunch of sleeping pills go into my car and and let a butane gas cylinder open inside... I do not know how to help myselfSorry for long post i have too much shit going on in my mind and who knows if i end up doing it in the near future i will send my reddit account to my closest friends so at least they know what i had going on in my mind. 4 and a half years of depression and suicide thoughts is there any hope? 23M,Depression
17448,17468,I just wish some days I could just go into an emotional void. Just turn off all of them and be numb for a little bit just so I can fucking rest. My anxiety makes me so hyper aware of them and my depression makes them so intense. I am in a streak of lows this week today at work my anxiety is going fucking nuts so at least its out winning the fight with depression to occupy my mind. My brain just feels like the neurons are firing so fucking fast and all at once that I cannot function and I am going to just break . I cannot breathe today. I just need to breathe and I cannot but yet I am suppose to function like a normal adult in public with clients and coworkers but yet my brain feels like its circuits are about to fry. I try to go forward and I am stuck in this perpetual rerun of stuttering to get my thoughts in order and words formed to come out of my mouth. I just need to fucking breathe Does any one else need an emotional void some days?,Depression
17469,17489,I have been nearly depressed for more than 6 years and now i feel bad all the time and even scared and terrified about the future .It hurts a lot seeing myself as a loser and think where is that confident happy cheerful guy that i used to be and what makes life worse is when you let down the people who love and believed in you and it feels like i wish i was better off dead than letting them down. People say those are lucky who have their loved ones but i think it does not matter when they do not understand my pain rather blame me even they know me it hurts really hurts .I think of ending my life as though i do not have guts to do it i think i can when am so hurt but i think of my mother parents my loved ones and think what would happen to them if i die . I think it would be better for them if they never had me as am there in this world to let them down and make their life much more terrible than it already is and the thing is even if i live it gives them and even if i die it gives them pain and i still do not know which one would be better for them .There is a girl who liked or loved when i was in puc but i did not have guts to approach her as who would like a loser like me and she still texts me even after 4 years of college and i feel she is not interested in me. My family does not let me take any decision of my life related to my studies degree or anything and to their surpise i flunked in my degree for a guy who is 80 in every year in school and college. Yet in this miserable life i sometime still hope that things will get better maybe even fantasize that i would be really happy rather pretending to be and doing something in this life am passionate about make my parents proud happy and be successful and have a life rather than suffering alone always in pain disgusted by myself about the decision i took that brought me to where i am in life and as the day am so scared what suffering and pain the future awaits for me and i wish i could disappear just like that. MY LIFE,Depression

17525,17545,I am barely holding on and nobody has noticed I have been sad everyday and my anxiety just grows other times I feel numb or calm. A lot has happened the past couple of days its hard to process.. everyday I wake up and this feels like a literal nightmare. I also do not know if I can trust anymore I just feel so sad and I want to end it all. there is no hope left I do not see a future I do not see all the great things others see I just see more trouble obstacles up ahead I have been through so much already and I do not want to go through more. My city has been in shambles and under attack because of looting and violence buildings have been burnt to the ground and now that things are a bit quiet they want to rebuild. The residents would patrol everyday and night taking turns but they issued a statement that they have done their job and they will not be patrolling anymore which makes me anxious and afraid I feel as if they are letting their guard down way too early those looters want to come destroy our homes and lives too. I do not have a good feeling about this how can anyone feels safe after this? This life is already unbearable I do not feel good being alive anymore there is nothing for me here.. I want to leave bed for I suffer more.. its scary I cannot explain this to people. I feel sick to my stomach. Its only a matter of time before they get us.

17536,17556,You know that feeling of going insane ?it is a hard feeling to describe but I will do my best.it is losing the ability to think clearly. it is all just chaos. No real thoughts anymore.it is looking at yourself in the mirror and seeing your eyes are not what they used to be.it is doing weird things that you cannot explain why you are doing them. Nightmares or no dreams at all.Impulsively hurting yourself not hurting myself serious things like slapping myself over and over or biting myself etc without thinking about itampx200BSometimes there is a good day but they have been becoming rarer and rarer. At best a good couple of hours.I have been dealing with mental illness for close to 10 years now and I am only 19I find it hard to believe that I will find my way or that it will change when I am older.I am held on a leash by all these issues I have got and the list keeps growing.I have been looking into legal euthanasia a while ago read up on some stories of people my age asking for the same usually denied so they end up committing suicideI am not ready to die yet but i cannot see myself going much further then 30.I wish i could be a kid again. I was social smart and without a worry in the world.Nothing seriously traumatic even happened to me. But one side of my family is riddled with mental disease. I guess I am just another victim. I would not be the first to end it on my own terms. Not yet .. but maybe soon. have not left the house in about 6 months. Reaching my breaking point.,Depression

Just being mentally tired all day. Still wondering is it worth it,Depression
17619,17639,what is the point? what is the point in anything? right now the only reason I am not dead yet is because i cannot die with trauma from the mental fucking hospital and also because i need to gain the trust of my parents.I will need to wait for a few more months till i can plan my next attemptbut really what is the point in all of this?nothing matters and i have no hopethe reason i live is because of this one person this ONE online friend i havesomehow i still have enthusiasm when talking to himbut my parents forced me to stop talking to him so i do not know what i will dotheres a difference between 'reasons I am not dead yet' and 'reasons i live'reasons I am not dead yet would be factors that are an obstacle to your deathreasons you live would be the reasons that give you some sort of purpose and meaning to not die yourselfbut i am mainly here due to 'reasons I am not dead yet'nothing makes me happy and i despise almost everythingnothing worksi know that this is temperorary and whatever i know itbut that does not mean i have to bear with it everytime it comesit eventually goes away yes but it comes back as welland i can see that the tiny amount of time these feelings are not as intense is not a proper reason for me to liveits not worth itthat tiny bit of peace and then this suffering againits not worth what is the point,Depression

Its just so much to find the right one and god the phone calls. I cannot do the phone calls. I so wish I had a parent who would call for me n but that is just not my life . I also have a billion other phone calls I have been needing to make for weeks about other medical stuff but I just have not gotten thereIm doing really bad my meds stopped working two months ago and I quit my job and my mood is a rollercoaster throughout the day even though I do nothing but sit in my room. But does it matter. I do not even want to be happy. I am just fishing around for validation and attention. I cannot find the want for me to be happy in me so I search and hope for it in someone else. Fukin save me complex. cannot force myself to find a new therapist. make phone calls,Depression
17668,17688,Tomorrow is the only day off I have for the next two weeks so I am drinking as an excuse for the roller coaster of emotions I am going to have working 10 hours a day. I am an introvert so my only hobbies are video games manga anime and cute animals Working full time and coming home just to be lonely is the worst because I am usually uncomfortable with rl friends coworkers Would anyone like to talk? My depression is bad again,Depression
17686,17706,When the topic is about loneliness and being alone people say attractiveness do not matter TOO MUCH but they are lying because they do not want to seen like an bad person.When you change context where they can say what they really think truth comes out. Here is an example i read today on r relationship advice.Post is about a young man getting more fit and his close female friend asking him out. She rejected him before because he was ugly.Some of the comments when you do not look bad saying it in this context but it is true all the time I feel like physical attraction is a huge part of a relationship. does not really make sense to date someone you are not physically attracted to but you are right that physicality is a fraction of what makes people right for each other. Sexual attraction is a MUST. People keep saying like oh its the confidence difference like dude I got more confident because people were telling me how good I looked when I put on muscle and trim up better. it is mostly about looks. Get over it dude. Physical attraction is just important and generally a prerequisite News flash ... Many people who like their partner like them because of how they look. Every girl has a filter for physically unattractive men. Luckily you had the only unattractive physical quality that can be easily changed weight. And now you are past her filter. Congratulations. These people comes places like this and tell us its about your personality. No it is not. Some of us ugly. that is it.But i believed these people before. I thought oh if i improve my personality i can find someone. Yeah you can improve your personality IF YOU HAVE BIG PROBLEMS. Like really bad habits or addictions that makes your life worse. Examples like that can be really make big changes. But other than that improving personality do not actually mean anything. it is an empty word. Everyone has different personalities. Having depression is not a personality. it is an health issue and it can be fixed. Depression stops you being you. it is an illness. Doctors literally gives you pills for this. There is no pills for personality.it is your personality is an insult. What do they mean it is our personality ?? They do not even knows us. All of us so different from each other. All of our hobbies and lifestyles are different. Our political view is different. Our views about life and what we want from it is different.These is why sometimes we see people saying even bad people have relationships but i do not have any. They think this and feel bad about themself. They believed the lie. If we look how many people started a relationship it will be LOOKS gt PERSONALITY. Always. This is why. it is this easy. What personalities change is how long the relationship will last and what will people experience in this relationship. that is it.Looks come first and THIS IS NOT A BAD THING. it is so much better when you know you are alone because you are ugly. Saying everyone it is personality is actually the bad thing. Like swear to me or literally punch me in the face. It hurts so much when everyone lie and say its personality. it is like it is your finger print. This is why you are lonely Everyone has different finger print stoooop.I am saying these because i believed this 5 years ago when i was 19. I tried improving my personality. I tried everything these people said to me. Nothing worked. And i find myself having a major depression. I used pills with doctor prescription for 3 years. I lost all my friends. Just now I am becoming healthy again and now i can find friends again too. I asked them about my apperance and most of said you are unattractive and I LOVE MY FRIENDS because of this. Thank Youu!If you do not have a relationship and want to have one here is what you ACTUALLY SHOULD DO1. Improve your looks. Make yourself look attractive as much as possible.2. Fix your bad habits. Most of us has bad habits that we do not actually like doing it. Like watching too much tv or playing video games. These can be little lifestyle changes too. Like living in place where you do not like or working in a job you hate. These things are habits too you do it every day. Try to change this things becasue they supress your personality and emotions.3. Try being more healthy. Mentally and phsycially.4. Dating is NOT a must. do not believe the media and people. You can be happy alone too and your friends. If you want someone try to do not make this your main goal and take it easy. Personality matters more. made me have major depression for 5 years.,Depression
17692,17712,That recurring sentence in my life just basically proves that people do not understand depression.There is nothing you enjoy! that is the whole point! For fcks sake... Just find the things you enjoy,Depression
17700,17720,I constantly feel like I am not good enough for anyone or anything. Can someone help me get out of this reality? Need advice,Depression
17720,17740,Genuinely just looking for any resources at this point of other survivors that might have some advice for another? I am a 26 year old male who previously survived Hodgkins lymphoma. I have tried talking to professionals in therapy about my mental state but its always the same answers. My anxiety and overthinking has hit an all time high and I do not feel as though I can speak on the things I am thinking about with the people closest in my life. I cannot tell them because I do not want them to have to deal with my personal struggles and Id rather just keep them out of where my mind lingers. I have had people say its selfish but the last thing I want is for my issues to fuck up the only good things in my life. Post Cancer Depression,Depression
17730,17750,I suffer from severe depression and anxiety for years now. I know I most likely need medication but the problem is I am a sex worker for a living and I cannot afford to lose my sex drive. I know antidepressants have a side effect of making you not horny and that is why I have not gotten treatment even though I definitely need at this point since suicidal ideation is coming into play. Any alternatives or are there antidepressants that do not have that side effect ? Antidepressants and loss of sex drive,Depression
17738,17758,I take AP classes and am on paper a great student but I absolutely hate school. The second semester of last year I was selfharming and leading a very inconsistent life. I would stay up days at a time just doing work just waiting for it to all be over. I do not have any aspirations for my career and I do not even want to continue school. I do not want to be dependent on my parents forever either but clearly I am too worthless and lazy to actually do anything about it. Is this normal to feel at a very low point during Summer break? I just absolutely loathe school but it seems like I have to go in order to just lead only a possibly more comfortable life. Most people and probably I will end up in the cycle of workingandwaiting for the next break or end up dependent on others both of which I am doing now. The future looks dim and adulthood seems like a hopeless incessant version of what I am dealing with now. I am not sure I can even become a capable adult at this point. I have thought about just ending it all but I am ready to say goodbye to my family even if I know I am disappointing them and everyone else by being this way. Does anything get better? Advice for how to deal with the impending doom of age.,Depression
17775,17795,I do nothing of value to me or anyone else. I have nothing and believe in nothing and I am pretty sure I am no one. This life feels so worthless. Why am I here? There is nothing left,Depression
17801,17821,I am 28 unemployed and sick with Covid. I am single do not have my own place and am constantly being moved from house to house just trying to make it by. Now I do not know where to go or what to do with my life anymore and its driving me insane...I have always been a pretty cheery guy but these past few years have really solidified my loss of direction. I feel like I have no sense of self anymore. I am smart physically capable no records even own my own car. But I still feel like its all in service to nothing. Should I just strike out and try and get my own place? Then what? What do I do with it?! What is my purpose!I never really thought like this before a few years ago. Stupid thing is nothing even happened no big break up or great loss in my life. I just woke up one day and started asking why. Ask enough times and eventually the silence starts to eat away at you at least it did me...I do not really think I believe in suicide as an answer here but it would be nice to not feel so damn alone and isolated in my own head. Maybe I just need someone to share the space with. Someone to reach out and grab onto just to make sure I am still on earth from time to time. I do not even know anymore... Sorry I do not know where to put all these feelings. So I will leave them with you...,Depression
17811,17831,I realize that one of the things that really makes me happy in life is video games so I am always thinking about them and researching them and buying them. However its like every time I buy a new game I am happy but then weeks or months later I am depressed again and I always want more. I do not get it the moment I think xy game will make me happy xy game will cure my depressionit does not. I am just spending money on games just to make myself feel good a bit and then I realize that these things only bring small periods of joy. they are just material things I think I get too obsessed with materialism and I drive myself crazy sometimes because all I can think about is games and being happy only if I have more of them. What do you guys think I should do about this feeling idk. Its just embarrassing. I have a problem Materialism,Depression

I really do not understand why I have to deal with this.....,Depression
17851,17871,I used to be so smart at the top of my class. I had so much promise. But now I struggle with basic human functions and social interactions. Depression has made is so hard for me to focus on anything be it school work or even just taking care of myself. I feel like my mind is stuck in the past just replaying all the regrets and failures of my lifetime this leaving no room for any new information new skills or new ambitions. it is like a mold festering over mind slowly shutting off parts of my brain untill I am braindead with no option but to end it. does anyone relate? Depression has made me so dumb,Depression
17852,17872,This is just one long rant.My family fights. Mainly it is just Daniel and I Daniel being the one my mom married before I was born. I do not consider him anything close to a father figure but he is the only thing I have other than teachers counselors or school staff. Fighting has taken a toll on me a lot. I am always the one at fault and he makes sure to phrase it in a way that makes me the one in the wrong always. This has ended up with me scared of loud noises feeling like a failure feeling unloved depressed scared of hurting people scared of being around people scared of making mistakes scared of offending people scared of authoritarian figures that would coincide with father figures defensive rude in many cases and in some ways unable to properly read cues though this might be an autism thing. For just over ten years we have been digging a huge pit of anger and hate mainly my hate for him and the grief that comes with not feeling loved by someone who you see everyone else loved by. The depression stemming from the constant battling has ended me up in hospital three times due to being suicidal after fights mainly because I feel like a disappointment. I end up wanting to punch him in the face push him out the door and lock every single entrance but I will never be strong enough emotionally for that. I am already a failure as is.I find it incredibly hard to cry mainly because of how much I did in the early years and have ended up being semiviolent when it comes to confrontations with him. I will end up throwing things or slamming doors because I want to get away from him at all costs I want to put something in between me and him. This usually ends up with me wanting to kill myself like today. I did the only thing I could think of in the midst of the pain and depression today I left the house and walked to the open space nearby. there is a bench there I am fond of. I managed to cry up there. I am glad nobody was out today. I contemplated commiting. I am glad I did not. I contemplated running away. I am glad I did not. The only thing keeping me sane is the people I love and I hate it so much. I feel like I should live for more than just spite and to make others happy. I just want to be happy.The thing that hurts the most is when I see families having fun together. A dad and his child reading a book on the sidewalk. A mom and her daughter walking the family pets. A husband and wife taking their toddler in a stroller.It makes me feel raw hate. Hate to myself that I cannot be a better person. Hate to myself that I cannot have that because I cannot control what little temper I have. Hate that despite everything I do he cannot take responsibility for anything. I hate it. I hate me.How can I be happy when my whole life is pain and sadness? How can I be happy when the person I am supposed to look up to despises me more than the dogs I pass in their yards? Why do the dogs pause to see if I am ok longer than he does. I want happiness. Please. I would give anything for that peace.tldr I am in pain. I hate myself my dad everything I am. I just want happiness. I feel like shit and I need to rant. Thisll be long you do not have to read. Tw suicide self harm,Depression
17855,17875,my mom has been pretty dismissive saying that I am probably not depressed just deep in teen angst ... since age 7 somehow. but then just said to me that my dad has been depressed recently because he cannot go out and see his friends. It could be that I do not see the full scope but I do not think so. I have said that I match all the criteria and she just says that I should not jump to self diagnosis based on the internet but then diagnosed my dad based on the internet. I do not want to have her pity me but I also hate when she says I do not want to be dismissive but how do I make my mom stop being dismissive of my mental health,Depression
17871,17891,I have just switched SSRIs and I feel better like I feel stable. However although I do feel better its like my brain can never switch off I am not anxious but its like I have developed adhd because I feel like I always need to be doing something constantly I find it near impossible to just sit or lie down and just watch a video or movie etc. And before you say it no its not to distract myself from feeling crap. Like I just want to be able to relax again and just enjoy things. Help? Depression and HyperactivityADHD,Depression
17897,17917,I am so miserable with my life. I feel so alone and depressed. I feel disconnected from my family I feel like no one cares I am sick of it. I am sick of having mental illnesses that make me scared to be alone and clingy and codependent I am sick of having to go through various coping exercises to deal with small issues. I am so sick of it. I want to have a normal brain and normal reasoning naturally I do not want everything to be a wheel of mental torture anymore. I want to be normal so badly but its so hard.

17916,17936,He just says Your emotions and feelings are entirely your choice and in your controlOr he will say You look tense and frustrated. If you do not smile genuinely I will revoke privilegesIt makes me feel more like shit. It makes me feel worthless and hated.I just have to take a smile in front of him to make him think I am okay.A voice emerged from deep within my twisted mind reminding me of how hypocritical I am.I never give him the genuine smile he expects from me. I am not good enough so I do think that I deserve all of the things that he takes away from me.I should be able to just snap out of it as he wants me to.But I cannot and that just makes me feel more worthless.I do not have the right to feel like this when there are people out there that have it worse than me.that is why I should die.

17997,18017,I have been working 3rd shift this summer and i really fuckin hate it. but i do not have a choice. i need this job so i can save up money to pay for rentutilities and my future student debt. every day i wake up at like 8pm to go to work and when i get home i end up sleeping 10 hours. the worst part? I am still fucking tired!! i could sleep for 14 hours and wake up still tired as fuck and wanting to go back to bed. it sucks because i have things i want to do chores i have to do but by the time I am awake to even think about doing them i have work in like an hour. it is also probably not a good idea but i stopped taking my zoloft because if i take before work it makes me even more tired. this is all temporary but once i move into this apartment and start school again I will have to find another job while juggling my course load. after graduation i feel like I am going to be stuck flipping burgers to get by and i fucking hate it. sorry for the rant I am just really frustrated and hopeless right now. fuck this shit y'know?,Depression
17998,18018,I was living with my partner's family in a foreign country during the pandemic. During the onset of the pandemic i was highly stressed and crying all the time. I had to return home to renew my passport. I got home and felt so depressed. I am almost 30 and my parents were criticizing me constantly. Started having constant suicidal ideation. I finished my MA during the pandemic and have struggled to find work. My parents were supporting me but when i chose to return to my partner. They cut me off. Which i understand but now its so much more pressure. I have applied to over a 100 jobs in the last 6months with several interviews but no luck. It'a affecting my self esteem in a BIG way. I am now dipping heavily into my savings. I thought i would be happier with my partner. Suicidal ideation is less but damn. I feel awful. And i have no motivation to apply for jobs or wake up. Now that I am in a foreign country with 0 friends or support systms i feel like i just made my life worse. But i feel like all options are awful. And nothing would make me happy anyway.

18168,18188,Dear allI am so tired from the past years. A lot has happened and after graduation I cannot seem to build an adult life. In the city where I live housing is crazy expensive and in contrast to my friends I come from a poor family with quite some problems. When those problems flared up during my studies they influenced my grades. Which now influences my chances at getting a decent job which of course influences the fact I cannot rent an apartment let alone buy one.At this moment I am living with a few flatmates to save costs but I am almost thirty and really want to have my own place sometime. The difference between me and all of my friends is making me depressed. Especially since I got good grades and did loads of side activities in the periods the family problems were more to the background. It just feels unfair but that is probably life...Any advice on how to cope with this situation? Do I need to make practical changes or is it more of a mindset thing? Like I try my best with coaches and looking for new jobs. But in the meantime I feel miserable and tired. cannot build a life as a near 30 year old.,Depression

18213,18233,I never had anyone to open up to not until I met my girlfriend. Things were going great. The moment I get attached to someone I start to slowly open up. I trust her. I share my traumas to her and I think it is now overwhelming her. By the time I open up about the people causing my trauma she gets mad at how obnoxious these certain people are. I do admit that at times I speak ill to these people. This is the time where I am infuriated and speak whatever that I have been locking up in my mind. Unconsciously bottled up emotions then start to act up. I am a very distant person. Once I get attached to someone its something else. The everyday person that everyone knew well is far from the way I act towards the person I am attached to. I have observed that she is starting to get overwhelmed about the problems I have gone and still going through. Despite talking about this and that I can easily perceive her body language. She checks up on me and wants me to open up. she is the only person I could open up to. I remembered the moment where she told me she is THAT special for me to finally open up. She was giddy about this idea. I have reminded her that she should not fix me but I do understand that as my very partner there is a sense of responsibility to it despite the constant reassurance. I am doing my best to pretend to her that I am having great progress on being genuinely happy. Since then I started to keep silent about my personal conflicts however she could at times notice. Now here I am in reddit venting out anonymously. It is my only escape. I can vent out have temporary peace knowing there is such media platform with users I deeply relate to be detracted from reality and avoid putting much burden on my partner. This may sound stupid to some that I would sacrifice my own wellbeing and dignity to her but if I had to be honest I have never felt love being in love and being loved for a long time. she is the best that has ever happened to me. I value her to my very core. Without her I am certain that I would be dead right now. Losing her is my last straw. As long as I have reddit a place to vent out there will always be a number of people who will bring me to a whole sense of belonging. Hiding from my partner,Depression

18285,18305,No one takes my depression seriously. They all think I am joking or coming up with excuses for my failures. it is getting harder and harder by day and I do not know what to do. Next year is my Bacaloria and I feel like this illness is going to make studying for it x100 times harder. I cannot mess my Bacaloria up. Pretty much the rest of my life depends on it.Since no one around me seems to care about my depression the only choice I am left with is to treat alone but I just do not see how that can be achieved. How do I treat this illness alone?,Depression
18289,18309,Does identifying the source of depression even help? I have been taking lexapro for a few months now and i think it works sometimes but can still get down real quick. Feel like therapy is a waste of time when its a chemical imbalance not sure what talking or finding problems is going to do. Like now I am aware of why I hate myself instead of thinking its just how I am. Identifing the problem,Depression
18314,18334,About a month ago I moved out of my hometown because of someone who i used to be close with. Being near her makes me feel all kinds of negative emotions mostly because I am torn about what to really feel about our situation. I cannot fully hate hermaybe because I really loved her in more ways than one. So I moved out and I had my birthday recently. It was one of the most lonely birthdays I had but some people still managed to send me birthday greetings and some even video called me. I was starting to feel better about when I saw a notification informing me that one of my friends commented on her new post. When I checked it it was a provoking post subtly informing the world that missing some things in your life that were there for a long time in this case my presence can be the best thing that can even happen with a picture of her smiling. I was so angry and sad and my depression starts kicking in again. After what I did after giving up my proximity to my family and friends the comfort I had just to make things better she just did that. I did not tell anyone why I left just did for her privacy for no one to bother her and this is what I get. And it sucks more because I have no one to tell this except strangers online. I just want this to end. I have been doing well for two months but a post from that person makes me want to hurt myself again.,Depression
18323,18343,For fckin 7 years I have been treated like a machinedo what you are told and stfumy opinion never mattersI am not allowed to make mistakesI am not allowed to be myself and I never have a choice if I am told to do something by family members and etc.I have been isolated from having friends and if I do I will only see them for 2 years and that is it and now I feel comfortable when I am alone and I often do not feel anything anymore but for some reason when I am in my room for the whole dayalone and not bothering anyone...they say I am being rude but when I do the opposite of that I am still being rude and now I am on the process of being disowned just because I do not act like the other kidssmileslaughact like everything is okay and make friendsall of that is now hardI literally have no energy Apparently I am not allowed to act like myself anymore and my mental health clear does not matter,Depression
18372,18392,I am 18 and I am depressed and no one knows I have been like this for awhile now but it gets worse as the years past by i remember the last time I have actually been truly happy and it was in the 6th grade. I have never felt at home when I am home. i hate my parents and even though they are not that bad i feel like they only take care of me so that when they grow old someone will take care of them instead of the actually loving me as the first thing they say when they tell me what job to consider is that they want that when they grow old that they will be taken care of. i also feel really shitty due to my social life not being that good i mean i have a few good friends but no one knows how i feel. my love life is also shit because i keep getting rejected which i understand cus who would want to be with a guy like me but what makes it feel bad is that i feel like people especially girls i like only want me when they need help in their studies the constant rejection made me numb to it and emotional pain as even when i want to cry i cannot but i really want to because everyday my heart aches and i just want to release all this pent up frustration. i also have a lot of suicidal thoughts and keep thinking of using the kitchen knife to cut my wrists and slice my throat. i also feel like going to the college of my dreams is impossible due to me being just average. my life is so shit but i do not want to die I am just so tired of it because all i want is to be loved i just want to vent,Depression
18447,18467,This is a throwaway as my friends and some colleagues know my main reddit. Also sorry if this is not the right subreddit.ampx200BTo start I had a pretty good upbringing and almost no problems at all. I went through school without much trouble. My parents were good to me. Really nothing to complain about. But I just do not feel joy in anything at all hobby's I had just feel so mundane like everything else. I quickly get annoyed or just drained when I am able to hangout with friends. When I am alone for too long my thoughts just get so deep and sometimes get suicidal. This has been going on for sometime.Despite Covid19 rampaging around I could find a somewhat decent paying job. I drowned myself in work just so I could not think at all. My colleague and now somewhat close friend was worried about me working too much but to be honest I do not mind it. That was until she made it clear I was really just living to work the past year. I recently made a promotion to a supervising position but frankly it does not do much to me. it is not that I miss my old work that much but it just does not trigger anything inside of me. If anything I am sort of left with a bittersweet feeling. This is just me in a nutshell. A 22 year old who had a normal upbringing who for some reason has no joy in life or a goal at all. Why,Depression
18448,18468,A long warm cozzy hug. But i do not have anyone... I am just writing hopeless text that will not help me... it is so hard to accept that you will be lonely for the rest of your life. To accept that you will fall asleep every night wishing for a hug that will never exist... I need a hug...,Depression
18472,18492,I have been in this sink of depression for months. I cannot get up most mornings I lay in bed I play PC games to escape and I just throw myself a pity party all of the time playing the victim when its all my fault. A few months ago I broke up with my gf of 5 years for a lot of reasons. She was more career oriented she chose it over me. I cannot be mad at someone for following their dreams but I was so hurt she chose to go to an out of state school especially since already just up and left to work far away without talking with me about it. She then contacts me saying she is actually not going to an out of state school but the school we talked about in the first place. But I cannot stand talking to her she makes me so angry I fall into this rage filled depression. I am supposed to start school as a fire fighter at my local college. I feel fat depressed and disgusting. I have waited for this opportunity for so long I cannot get up to find motivation or anything. I do not know what to do or how to handle this. I feel horrible,Depression
18488,18508,Legs grow heavy with each day that passMind cloudy and a heart full of scarsBut i will not break till the end of my lifeAll i can give is all for you my beloved wife My heart grows cold with each day i fightEach day it grows dimmer my hope and my lightBut each day i feel the warmth of my loverGrants me the strenght to fight till its over My mind grows darker with each day i failMy hopes dreams and will fading awayBut for you my love i will prevailUntil i break with you i will stay But when I am gone do not mourne for meWipe those tears and keep staying strongYou were always what i hoped love to beAnd with my last breath in your arms i belongBy fyzanfyzz211 For you,Depression
18502,18522,They were arguing like usual but this time it was the first time it got bad. My mom broke a window my dad broke the doorpushed my sister and so much more. I feel like I am worthless and I cannot do anything for my sister.I cut myself and it took away a lot of my anger towards him. My parents got very physical today,Depression

Cuz you are going into that sweatshop shithole and you are going to have to pretend like everything is normal or you can be unemployed and miserable you unlucky sack of shit!

18524,18544,I'v been crippled with depression and anxiety since my early teens and it had a catastrophic impact on my life.I am now early 30s and recently started antidepressants i cannot help looking back at my past and compare myself to others.I had no social life or professional one for the past 15 years my whole life is like a big steamy crater after a nuke there is nothing but sadness and despair. How does one forgive himself and move on? How can i start my life from zero in my mid 30s?!thank you for reading. How do you forgive yourself for the lost years,Depression
18558,18578,I am currently over thinking about my relationship and I am headed to a dark place. I feel like I am not good enough for my partner and that they will leave me if I end up hurting myself. I have been clean for a over a year now but I am having the urges to do it again but I know that my partner does not like it when I did so I end up hating myself because it hurts them too. Over thinking,Depression
18607,18627,So a friend of mine sent two posts about how equally worthless everyone is. I asked him what happened and tried to help by remind him that he is good at singing and suits. But he said he got drunk and messed both up. I feel like i need to say something but i do not know what to say. Please help My friend got drunk and messed up urgent,Depression
18612,18632,Instead I got this. So I was trying to do a little light reading...,Depression
18622,18642,I am a great listener and a lot of the time I want to be listened too but the thing is that I do not want to make people uncomfortable with my feelings.. Like I know I have very good friends that love me but still. It just makes me feel weird to share my emotions with people because I feel they are going to get bored or so. Does it happen to you too??,Depression
18627,18647,well to be honest I do not even know why I am here but I just need somewhere I can voice my thoughts as I feel like they are building in my head to the stage that I would rather talk to my self than others. it may sound like I am exaggerating right but I spend soo much time alone that even when I am with others id rather not be. this is my fault either I was such a funny kid class clown so popular in school and even after I finished school too. but that all changed when I was shipped over seas by my mum. I cannot lie and say know I do not see that it was for my benefit I could have simply died had I stayed there and for a parent that is enough reason. but to send me somewhere like that and treat me the way they did really stripped me for humanity. I saw things I should not have and that is when the thoughts started. I was locked up for about 7 months over seas as my family thought it would help me but there is where I create a version of life in my head and know I cannot escape it. my life is finally going good I have worked soo hard for that but mentally I am suffering soo much. I cannot tell anyone this in real life because why would humans care. they never cared when I really needed them and know it feels like if they do care is because they want something. and also I promised my self that I will never be vulnerable again in this life which is another reason I can never tell anyone. so I smile at the few people I do see but in saying ALLL OF THIS I do want to make friends and there is apart of me that wants to be accepted in someone is life as I really feel like I have never belonged. I would love some tips or maybe books to read that may help me. I REALLY FEEL LIKE I AM DROWNING Why I made this account,Depression
18665,18685,I am tired of being alone feeling lonely amp feeling like I owe the world an apology for no particular reason other than the fact that that I am not adding up to what anyone wants me to be. I want so bad to meet everyone is expectations but there is something inside of me that also says fuck your expectations! And I am sorry! Why cannot I just be normal? Why cannot I just be what everyone wants me to be? Why cannot I just be happy? Why cannot I just do what I am supposed to do? Why cannot I just respond to every single message from every single person all day every day? Why cannot I just take a joke? Why cannot I just stay cool and not get upset so easily? Why cannot I just go on a diet and get my body in shape? Its up to me its not hard to take control! You just have to decide to do it! Its that easy! Why cannot it just be that easy? Why cannot you just do it? Why are you always so sad?Why cannot you suck it up and move on? Why do you drink like that? Why do you feel like that? You should not be like that! Why cannot you just be normal?Why cannot you just be ok? Why?,Depression
18679,18699,Mostly things seem to be circumstantial but it weighs much heavier when you have a constant sadness looming over you the stones life throws ar you get much larger. Being numb feels alright I guess its better than pain sometimes.Grief hurts loss hurts bad choices hurt. Being a lump of coal hurts. Depression causes me to deal with things so poorly. My head is swirling and I feel so low.I want to be excited for things I am doing but I feel like I am leaving things behind and I feel like I have lost a large chunk of myself one I am still desperately holding onto because I do not want it to be gone but I do not have a choice.Life feels cruel I blame myself for a lot of pain I feel. I do. But I also just wish I could let go of it but I know it is a pain that will not ever get easier just less prominent maybe. I am just really not doing that great,Depression
18688,18708,Hi guys I am looking for podcasts to listen to that tall about depression anxiety mood disorders grieving trauma healing etc. I do not want a comedic approach not after interview's success stories etc. Ideally one host just talking you through why people feel this way tips on managing your mental health etc.I am going through a very very dark time and while I would like to eventually listen to more light hearted podcasts I find people making jokes and laughing etc a bit off putting at the moment. Hopefully I am making sense. Thanks. Podcast recommendation,Depression
18702,18722,ampx200Bso had my breakdown in march have anxiety and bouts of depression but i am also weak as in i cannot fend for myself and am hypersensitive . i feel like most healthy people can get through these mean taunts etc but when you just are not of sound happy mind is this depression to a degree? the reason i am asking this question and do not know myself is because i do not necessarily feel deeply sad every minute but i am also not happy in the slightest. I want 2 do well for my future just have lacked motivation for last whileperhaps i have lived like this for so long good 45 years now that i do not know any better and thought this was the norm?Just started zoloft for the record. so hopefully i will become my stronger real self again soon Do you think I am still depressed if my sister says something mean and insensitive and I just cannot take it and am hypersensitive and immediately plummet into sadness and emptiness?,Depression
18729,18749,It all started 2 months ago I unexpectedly lost my dad to cancer. Now my girlfriend of 6 years is leaving me we still talk and I am trying like hell not to lose her. she is the only person I got we have lived together 5 years have a great rental. So on top of working full time managing a store and dealing with losing my dad I worry about her and paying for the rental by myself or moving which I really do not want to do. These are the darkest days of my life and my will to live is at an all time low. I do not know what to do anymore. 26 and having the worst year of my life,Depression

18750,18770,They talk about their own achievementsThey love to judge others invalidate others bc they are so fcking insecure inside. They value their integrity and worth as higher than the regular person. These people talk dirt about people that do not work and hope they end up poor and in the dirt bc well they worked for it despite the societal benefits they took to achieve it. I want to threaten to kill people like this bc I do not like the attitude and I am jealous of what they have. I sometimes seriously want to do something to people like this despite the consequences. Is that bad? I know exactly how successful people talk,Depression
18764,18784,I was raised by my grand parents because my parents broke up and left me when i was very little. When i was a child the only people i could talk to was my grand parents because i had no one other than them. I am the only child and i had no family other than my grand parents. I also never had a friend because i rarely see people other than my grand parents. I do not know how to talk to young people like me and make friends because all my life I have been around really old people. I like my grand parents but I am really tired of being around old people they suck all my energy and make me feel like I am old too. I do not really have anything to talk with them now so they just watch tv all day and we do not talk much. So the problem is I am in my room all day with nothing to do no one to talk and nowhere to go. When i go outside i see people around their friends and family and knowing that I am all alone makes me feel worthless. So i feel bad and head home again. But there is nothing to do at home so i start thinking questioning my life and existence. And that makes me feel worse because i got nothing and no one to live for. I do not know what to do with my life and i do not really enjoy living. Life seems really bleak right now and I am hopeless.This is my second language so I am sorry if i made any mistake while writing this. .,Depression
18821,18841,I do not see normal to tell a person who practices SH and with high suicidal tendencies that why not commit suicide I genuinely want to know if this is normal therapy behavior or should I change psychologist... Sorry for my bad english I am not native. Is it normal for a psychologist to tell me that if I want to commit suicide why have not I done it yet?,Depression
18844,18864,I do not like my life I do not like society I do not like the future that is awaiting us and I do not want to live anymore. If I did not have family I would kill myself but since I know they would blame themselves for the rest of their lives I sadly do not feel the freedom to do that. Over the last years I have been increasingly isolating myself from the world often not answering phone callstexts etc. because I just do not see the point in doing anything if at the core of my beliefs I do not see the point in living. Some facts about me I am male 29 pretty healthy have a university degree get by fincancially live in one of the best places in the world and had a decent childhoodupbringing. My feelings are not an emotional reaction but rather a rational conclusion formed over the years.I really do not want to go to therapy I have tried it twice. It makes me feel like this life is even more useless if I need to work my ass off just to be able to afford therapy so that they can ask me fancy questions tell me to meditate or to medicate so everything might get a little bit more bearable.I just do not want to live! But I also do not want to be the asshole that messes up other lives by killing myself. What can I do? I just do not want to live! But I also do not want to be the asshole that messes up other lives by killing myself. What can I do?,Depression
18864,18884,I am almost 24 years old and lately I have been feeling absolutely horrible for context back in 2018 I have had an open abdominal surgery for a condition called MALS Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome I had been ill for about 3 years until I was believed and the reason for my illness found up until today I feel more like a hull of myself I can cope in daily life but sometimes it just gets so strong unbearable almost to the point where I just do not know what to do anymore.I can barely sleep my own mind haunts me the words I have heard the feelings I felt the experiences I made sometimes it is just so much.Oftentimes I will look into the mirror and I just cannot bring up the love to look at the image sometimes I cannot bear the sight.I do not want to be this way but I just cannot bring up the energy to get up and try again over and over and over especially when there does not seem to be anything worth looking forward to.Sometimes I wonder does it not feel weird when you look through my intimate posts and photos in the evening MZ? Is there no shame besides the one you attempt to push onto me? After all this time the ship did not arrive at the harbor nobody came out and the harbor was quiet a preacher stood on his wooden stand glancing across the cobblestone plaza as if it were the home of his long lost friend the eyes were blue.nulla est in nobis veritas I feel so lost..,Depression

18930,18950,Whenever I voice out my suicidal thoughts to a friend she always says just think about what your mom would feel. She does not explicitly say that killing yourself is a selfish act but that is the point I am getting from her. Makes me wonder if a person really wants to die is not it selfish for them for asking the person to stay even though they know the person is has it so bad? If someone wants to go cannot they just let them go?? Is it selfish for wanting to die?,Depression
18964,18984,Drawing is the only thing I have. it is the only thing that makes me feel ok sometimes and I occasionally take commissions because it makes me happy to be able to draw for other people but my mom wants me to turn it into an actual business a full time thing and I keep telling her that I do not want to because I do not want to grow to hate my hobby I do not want to grow to hate the one thing that makes me happy and I know I will if I am forced everyday to do commissions and she just does not understand that and she always tells me that I am being stupid and that I always think I am right and it fucking breaks me down so much I was just coming out of a depressive episode and now she is just fucking pulling me right back into one and I do not know what to do....One of the reasons I am taking some commissions as well is so I can get out of this house even for just a weekI just want to feel ok again I need to rant...,Depression
19047,19067,All I do is bitch about laughably minor things. No one wants to hear that shit. People keep leaving me because all I have to offer to every conversation is bitching about something.

19070,19090,I know this does not really fit here but it still kind of does because these are the pieces of S I have had to grow up with and deal with on a daily basis. They got tested for COVID and their results came back positive and they are still acting like it is not worth worrying about just because they are lucky enough their symptoms are not that bad.. they gave it to me too and I have been doing the best I can taking all of the precautions this whole time to avoid getting it.. I tried to tell them to stop going places without a mask because they have COVID stop going places at all but they insist they still have to live their lives and that its not that bad.. I honestly wish their COVID was a worst case scenario.. because they truly deserve it.. who knows what they are actively doing to other peoples lives.. I have struggled for a long time with how I feel about them because they are my family.. but they are just evil.. knowing you have the virus and still going and spreading it so you will not be slightly inconvenienced or worse to prove a point at this point they are just literally evil I feel awful that I cannot do anything to stop them from doing this no matter what they will not stop.. is this a crime? If it is I would like to report them honestly My POS parents keep going into stores without a mask on while knowing they have COVID,Depression

Idk what to do anymore. Also thanks to anyone who found the time to read all of this I feel like I really need another perspective or something idk feel like I cannot move on from things that happened in my childhood like being bullied in school or treated unfairly. What should I do?,Depression
19108,19128,The other day. Depressive emotions overwhelmed me. Shrugged them off like other thoughts and moved on. Later. I realized I cannot.Processing thoughts in itself become hard. Much less insignificant habits of not wanting to do anything. I wished it remained there.... it did not.I had begun traversing to unknown territory desiring the comfort of nonexistence. Cherished this thought like it is home for me. Normalizing Wanting life is like crying from a happy dream. it is never reality.do not get me wrong suicide is not in my options. Me dreading existence is not me loving human death. Experiences in life are precious. Feelling emotions which a rock cannot feel is a meritkind of. I love happiness but feel burdened by my past my experiences and my existence. To embracing the hypothetical world of no me. Daydreaming the noeverwashere. IDK. Therapist is not an option either. I am 19 dependent on my parents who I tried to get me checked up for ADHD but received my veryhappy news of me possessed and should real the holy book etc. Am I really depressed?,Depression
19122,19142,I feel like the only thing that adds value to my relationship as a man is my job. That as a man I am only worth my paycheck. If I do not have a job I cannot see my kids my fianc will leave me. I hate where I work. Its keeping me from seeing my therapist. I have to work over till 5 every day and my therapist can only see me in the mornings. I get pointed even if I have a doctors note. I am really feeling down. I do not get any support from anyone. My fianc tells me to stop being a pussy. I do not know how much of this I can take at this point. I feel so broken. I feel aa though I have no value.,Depression
19145,19165,I felt good. I was happy I thought. But old habits slowly crept back in without me noticing. I stopped cleaning my room stopped being interested in things and began to day dream even more than usual. I was slowly sinking back into it. Tonight tho I feel like its hit rock bottom. I have never had a HUGE issue with my body. But recently its all I think about and all I notice about others. I hate myself again. I want to sleep forever again. I want to do anything to escape again. The perfect body waving in my face. As if to mess with me. I hate my body even more than I did during my last depressive episode and I want to fix it. You all are thinking rn just work out and eat well. WELL haha when you depend on food for happiness and a distraction idk it just makes me feel good from your depression even on a diet when I get upset I am quick to binge. When I start a work out routine it starts off well but then I lose interest and want to stay in bed all day and sleep as I do with everything nowadays and please do not bash me saying I am making excuses. I know its my fault and that is why it makes me so upset. I tell my body JUST DO IT but then I cannot move from bed. This kind of became a rant haha. Sorry about that point of the story tho I relapsed. I was better. Was.,Depression

TW MENTION OF SH,Depression
19169,19189,i am a 14 years old boy going to be 15 in 5 months and 14 days. i hope that day does not come as fast as my whole life has went. i have never hated myself so much more. I am an overweight kid that struggles to make friends because I am fucking useless all around. and I am not trying to look for compliments but i really am useless. i have one friend that devotes her time and tries so hard to keep me happy but i cannot give her happiness back. whenever she is around i cannot think of anything else. she is everything i ever wanted. today she was a bit upset today and today is not the first time i was not able to be of any use i manage to be just another obstacle she has to deal with. she has the biggest heart on earth she never looks at the bad side of things there truly is no one like her but she goes through so much and the one time she ranted to me a few weeks ago what did i do? i fucked it all up. i decided to comfort her but I am pretty sure all i did was make her feel worse. after that i have a fear in my heart and heavy guilt everytime i feel she is down to ask what happened. today i was not able to help her again. she makes me feel so loved i have never felt this nice from anyone before. i really fucking hate myself in fact at that moment i was looking at myself crying in the mirror i had never seen an uglier piece of shit. ever. what i saw in the mirror i fucking hate him to death. i have never seen an uglier face before never seen a more crooked smile before and never seen shitfilled eyes before. i have never met someone who cannot comfort anyone that bad as what i saw in the mirror. i went downstairs to my guest bedroom to lie down because that window has a better view at the sky than mine. i had never felt so disappointed at myself before i could sense even the clouds being embarrassed at how shitty of a person i am. i broke down again. and then comes my mother. my mother has always been a sweet lady always caring and putting others before herself and I have always loved her but showed hatred to her for no reason. she saw me crying she had not seen me crying since i was in 8. she immediately came beside me and asked me what is wrong. she had started tearing up i had never heard a more painful voice than that. i realised how shitty of a human i am how shitty of a boy i am and how shitty of a son i am. she burst in tears held my hand to her heart and said to me do not cry its okay. i had never felt more guilty than that moment of making my mother cry. i hope one day i can be a better son a better person and a better human. i hope one day my friend finds happiness maybe in someone else i hope she leaves me because i can sense she is having a shitty time dealing with me she is too kind to let go. i hope one day I am a better person for her because i truly love her nothing more. i have never loved a person so much i have never cried over a girl this much from the shallowest pit of my heart. i hope her and my mother forgive me for everything I have done. I am a living asshole. i broke down for the first time in a while in front of my mirror today i have never hated myself so much more.,Depression
19176,19196,I have had 5 jobs in the past year and only one has been longer than a monthmy first job which I went back to after leaving as a safety cushion with one lasting 2 and a half days.The most recent is my current job and I am worried I will hit the wall I did with the last few. The point where my brain decides that making my life better is not worth the work. It does not help that I have no idea what I want out of life so working hard feels pointless most of the time.I do want to have a good life but I do not know what that means. I do not know what to do with my free time because nothing seems very interesting and I lose attention after a bit of doing it anyway. I am not sure why most people stay alive because it does not seem worth it to me. All the good parts of life do not seem to make up for the bad parts. it is so hard to stay at a job because I do not want to be there and I do not have reason to need it. Why would I go be miserable for a quarter of my life at work just so I can be bored and unhappy for the rest of my life? Keeping a job,Depression
19202,19222,I am just a Fucking disappointment to everyone.I feel like a burden if I ask for help or show any inclination of what is actually going on.I am a year behind on school.I have food stains on my shirt I am out of shape. I just hate everything about myself I am so fucking sick of all the shit going on in my head.its so hard to cry.no ones asked me if I need help I know its hard for people to notice but I am not okay even though I tell myself and everyone else. I am worthless,Depression
19222,19242,lately I have been having a really hard time. i cannot bring myself to go into detail but it seems like my life is unraveling. there is so much that is out of my control and so much i do not know. I am exhausted both mentally and physically and I am starting to feel very lost and alone.with so much stress and sadness I have found that I am getting angry at every small inconvenience. i shut down over the smallest things and cannot seem to get a grip. this is completely out of character for me and i cannot get a handle on it. I am so disappointed in myself.help? I am becoming overreactive and miss my levelheaded self,Depression
19244,19264,If someone is depressed because they are not able to find a relationship no matter what their reasoning is telling them that nobody will want someone who is depressed is not helping... if anything now you have just solidified my belief that nobody will ever want me and there is no point in trying. I cannot just snap out of depression because you said well nobody is going to want you if you are sad. I hate this life. I hate myself. I hate existing on this stupid planet. I want out. Just a thought...,Depression

19261,19281,I just feel guilty all the time. I feel like I am always burdening someone. I am pregnant and I have a fianc who loves me but I just feel bad about everything I do and everything I feel. I feel bad for being sick and tired all the time because of my pregnancy. I feel guilty for not pushing through the sickness and working during this time. I feel bad for being pregnant and not wanting to be. I feel like I do not care enough about my baby. I feel bad for crying so much and being so sensitive. I just wish I was a different person with a different life sometimes my aunt died in December and I look back and feel guilty about not doing enough for her and spending more time with her before she died. I feel guilty for not wanting to express these feelings to my fianc. I feel guilty for being overly sensitive and overwhelmed by the world. Sometimes I feel like Id rather just not be here. It feels like no matter which path I choose I will mess it up and hurt someone and I do not want to mess up my babys life. Sometimes I wish I could just kill myself without hurting the baby and my fianc. I really love my fianc and Id never want to make him feel that sort of pain. I just wish there was a way I could disappear like I never happened. I feel guilty and ungrateful for not cherishing my life and what I have. there is a lot of people who have it a lot worse than me and I feel bad for being ungrateful for what I have a loving family a caring boyfriend a roof over my head good field of work and clean water and food. Wish I never existed,Depression
19263,19283,I never told my dad about my depression and anxiety. I never told him about my counselling and antidepressants or that I was crying every night for 2 months and went through hell to get myself the help I needed. So I do not know how he found out he must have seen the discarded medicine package in the bin. I thought he was trying to spend more time with me when he asked me to lunch with him. Turns out he was trying to get me alone to tell me that mental illness does not exist. That they need more prayer and help from God I am not Christian but I do not want to reveal my familys faith. He even said nonsensical stuff mentally ill people are possessed by lost spirits??? When I asked him who hes referring to he played coy and shrugged. Id been relatively stable for a while now until his words triggered anger and one of the worst anxiety attack within me which I had to suck up and pretend to look fine. At that moment I was forcibly brought back to months ago where I was questioning my self worth as an individual. I started thinking of killing myself again the temptation to OD when I got back home was so strong.All the work I put into managing my anxiety attacks and depression all down the drain in a matter of minutes. This is why I do not tell you shit dad. you would been preaching that mental illness is not real since my childhood days and that such people found themselves in such sorry states because they lacked faith in God. Always all about that fucking religious nonsense never once asking if I was okay or if I needed a shoulder to cry on. All my efforts to keep myself from suicide managing my mental illness all ruined and shited on by a few insensitive words,Depression
19277,19297,In the past few hours I have got so sad it feels like everything has sunken into my stomach and there is this really painful feeling in my chest and i cannot stop crying. I tried to talk to my mombut hey I get..think abt the good nothing happened to you for you to be sad Like no shitthat is why its an issue. I love getting blamed for things I cannot control. When my thoughts are in my head screaming at me that I should have died when something happened before that I am not naming and I should not have woke up this morning and Ill never be able or get anything I try for and everyone is who talks to me does not genuinely like me which I have a reason to think that but that is besides the pointits kind of difficult for me to just be like stfu I cannot just make my thoughts shut down but according to her everyone else can and I cannot function in this world without being able to do that??? But I get blamed for that?? Ok buddyI probably just sound like a untitled bitch who is mad at her mom so I am sorry for that I just need to get this out. I am so sick of the think of all the good you can just change your thought process if you think about the good and not the bad,Depression
19294,19314,Does anyone else experience sudden bursts of agitation restlessness or confusion? I have a low mood almost all day but I also get small bouts where my emotions are just all over the place and get extremely restless or feel like I cannot think clearly for about 30 seconds. I have been diagnosed with MDD but I also experience all these strange little periods I am scared that something else is going on. Idk. My mood also changes many times throughout the day for no external reason. Random bouts of confusionbrain fog?,Depression
19311,19331,let us just get straight to it. My dad is an alcoholic. He has been to rehab SIX TIMES. SIX! He has been drinking even before I was born and he continues to drink to this day. he is drunk right now. When I was 11 I was in baseball and one day he showed up at my baseball game completely drunk. I was so embarrassed and really really hurt. After the game teammates were making fun of me Hey I really like your dad. He seems fun. Hey when is your dad coming to the game next? Your dad is a real wino. I was hurt but I had to go to the next game and when I did one of the teammates brought a can of beer gave it to me and said I know your dad will love this. I asked my mom if we could leave. I told her I was not feeling well.I went home and decided to quit baseball. I told my mom that it was because I was not having fun but in reality I did not want to keep playing because I did not want to keep being bullied by the other kids and being embarrassed whenever my dad showed up drunk.My dad continued to drink. About 6 years ago my brother and I visited him for Christmas. I thought it would be nice. On Christmas Eve he said he was going out to the store. Usually it is about a half hour walk. He lost his drivers license due to a DWI He came back FIVE HOURS LATER absolutely hammered. On Christmas Eve. I was furious. I wanted to leave but I did not want to ruin everyone is Christmas. So I kept my mouth shut and cried myself to sleep. Worst christmas I have ever had.I stopped talking to him after that. I ignored his texts and I came up with excuses to avoid speaking to him. In September of 2019 my supervisor told me she would have to cut my hours. No reason given. I was barely making any money to live on. I could not pay my bills and for a while I had to park my car and walk to work because I could not afford insurance. So my dad decided to move in with me and said he would pay the bills.I was really upset with this decision. I did not want him to move in with me but I had no other choice. Ever since then I have had to deal with his drinking. CONSTANT DRINKING. I have screamed at him and pleaded with him to stop drinking and he does not listen. I have even grown to dread the sound of a can opening.About 3 months ago my 17 year old little brother came over. My dad decided to get shit faced. He was acting like a dick and was just being obnoxious. My brother ended up leaving and went home. My mom texted me and told me he came home crying. My 6 foot 7 inch tall brother who weighs 280 lbs cried because of my dad's behavior.On Monday my dad decided to start drinking at 1145 in the morning. 4 hours later and plenty of beers later he asked me to take him to the store. I was hesitant but I took him. We get inside and already my father is embarrassing me. I go off to get what I needed and I realized I forgot my wallet in the car. My dad pays for me and I thanked him twice for that. I paid him back when we get back in the car and we head home. On the way home my dad starts acting like a dick. He starts mocking me and going thanks for the money dad. Even though I thanked him twice. I was on edge at that point. I responded I already thanked you twice you idiot. Was it the best thing to say? No. But I was really upset. He got upset for me calling him an idiot. We get home and I am walking up the porch. He throws an empty bottle at my head and that was it. I had snapped. I turned walked down the steps and approached my father and punched him right in the jaw. I knocked him out. He was out for a good 3 minutes.He regained consciousness and I helped him inside. I do not really know how to feel about it though. I feel good for standing up for myself after dealing with a dismal father. But I also feel terrible because he is my father. I really do not know how to process all of this. Even 2 days later. I punched my father.,Depression
19327,19347,I am scheduled for my first session of therapy but I honestly do not see the point. they are going to drug me up and trick my brain into thinking I am happy. I cannot see that possibly happening. Every day that goes by I feel like I become worse. I am tired of people feeling sorry for me and I am tired of my depression ruin the friendships I have. I just want to disappear. I tried tricking myself into doing happy things like going on a date and at the end I felt worse than before. It seems my life is a one way path to dying alone and all my friends getting sick of my existence. I do not even have the motivation to cry any more. there is a wave of anxiety and sadness constantly drowning me and I just feel dead inside. I do not see how anyone or anything can help me any more. I just feel that everyone gets sick of me at some point or another and I am at the point where I feel dead inside.,Depression
19365,19385,Does depression get worse at certain times of the day? Does depression get worse at certain times of the day?,Depression
19395,19415,I feel like I am giving slowly my only option now is to probably get on some kind of antidepressant before I end up killing myself. It seems that there is not much else I can do otherwise. I talk a lot to my friends in general I cannot complain about having a lack of people yo talk to. But I lack the ability to derive I guess some kind of feeling of security from even that they are good friends I just cannot connect with them it seems. That problem has had me thinkimg about death all to often n just sustaining myself with distraction really it feels like things are all over the place but I want to get better I will try to get some antidepressants n see if they help I do not feel like doing this just as I am without some kind of help anymore. I just feel like I am drifting,Depression
19442,19462,21f I have struggled with depression for many years so this feeling is not new but it feels more real now if that makes any sense.I am severely unhappy with my life and although I could definitely be in worse situations my whole world just feels like it is crashing down. Friendships relationship family none of it seems important.But it is not that I do not value these relationships I just do not feel valued but I feel as though I have no escape from these situations.I just want to run away sometimes and start over. Everything Feels Like its Falling Apart,Depression
19568,19588,I do not know how to kill myself i do not have access to any kind of gun i cannot stand seeing blood or making myself bleed heard that hanging yourself is real painful maybe jumping from somewhere works but i do not know any place to jump and do not have any energy to find either the most reasonable way is to overdose on something but even that is so fucking hard with the drugs I have got like I got to take too many but that is just needs too many energy yk and I do not have access to any hard drugs to od on I feel like I am fucking drowning and it keep hurts my body and there is an exit but I am not able to go and use that exit please help me and tell me some easy way to quit this life I cannot stand it anymore. can you please help me,Depression
19591,19611,I want to matter to someone. Am I asking for too much? I just want to be worth something,Depression
19595,19615,I am just so tired of feeling completely misunderstood by my mum. I am tired of being sensitive and being hurt by the things she says to me because I know she worked so hard to give me and my sibling everything we have and all the opportunities I had. I have traveled I went to uni she supports me but I feel like I only disappoint her. Even thought I feel like her own trauma and the way she handled raising us is partially to blame for a lot of my anxiety and depression issues I cannot just blame her because I know she did her best....Now she found out I smoked weed and I cannot even face her because I feel so guilty. I feel like she blames me for everything and when I voice my feelings I get told I understood everything wrong and I am to blame for how I am.I love my mum I do not know what to do but she is had a massive impact in my most recent and worst depressive episodes and suicidal thoughts and she does not even have the slightest clue of how shitty I am feeling. And I cannot bring myself to tell her.I am just scared. I feel like I am alone and no one understands me. I do not know what I am going to do I cannot get myself to finish writing my thesis and I just want to finish this damn degree and figure out what I am going to do with myy life. I am so lost and confused. I feel like a failure.it is also taking a toll on my boyfriend and I feel so bad for bothering him with my depression I know I am not nice to be around and he is tired of listening to my problems. I feel like a burden and like I do not contribute to anything good. I really just wish I could fall asleep and not wake up anymore so my mind body and heart could finally rest. I recently started antidepressants and it has really helped my anxiety and depression but I still have awful lows even though they are shorter periods of time. My mum does not understand my depression and now she thinks I am to blame because I smoked weed when in reality weed was a coping mechanism I used in times I was feeling very bad some times caused by her. It might have not helped in the long run but it was not the bottomless hole she says it is. It helped me stay less depressed distract myself and in times it even helped me get work done when I could not get myself to do it sober. I know I hadhave a problem with it that is why my consumption was always very on and off because I could see myself losing control. But I am aware of it and ever since I started the antidepressants I have stopped smoking and I want to quit it for a long time if not forever. I want to get better and I try so hard to get up clean myself take a walk but everything is so hard.. And now I hate being at home with her because of the tension... I would love to have a nice relationship with my mum that is why I kept trying to talk and work things out but I was always met with victimization and accusations of guilt... I do not want to leave my mum alone but... I do not know what to do and this environment does not help me get better. Also I do not have a job right now and I do not think I have the strength to worki cannot get myself to do anything productive. I just... do not know what to do..... Except lie down and cry and scroll on my phone and think and blame myself and blame my mum and just want to stop existing...... I never thought I could actually be depressed but there is no denying it now and everything just feels hopeless. I do not know what the future looks like. The mental health support in my country is shit and I have been to 2 therapists had 1 bad experience with theFirst and an underwhelming one with the second and looking for a new therapist starting everything all over again and asking my mum for money for therapy just seems.... Exhausting English is not my 1st language Another depressed and misunderstood girl in her 20s rant,Depression
19607,19627,Nothing is helping the pain I am feeling right now crying does not even give me relief What the fuk do I do then cannot even off myself if I wanted to. Trapped in my suffering I am so tired of crying. it changes nothing,Depression
19641,19661,gtIf its too long do not read .Ok this is so lame and desparate sounding. but I have some questions which I do not want to keep asking or to be thinking and wondering when I start to get better with my ocd. I have two Questions. Anyone who can give a good answer thanks. Not just what I want to hear. But the truth. Because I am not planning on asking these questions ever again. And I want to know the real consequences of this sin. Its really important since it was singled out and I really want sound bible advice on this sin and the punishments if you know it . First on the blasphemy of The Holy Ghost. I did it like 5 months ago out of bitterness for my life. gt gtAnd as paul in the bible said that because many were bitter many be came defiled I think that is what he said. So when I realized I was angry at my life and was trying to do better. And I was not done with some habits I tried to promise God TO quit. I still had no real joy in my life and I promised to give up things I loved. Like certain music and foods. Also I was not very nice. Because I loved my family. But they like other things because of their judgements and the things they say to me I tried to protect myself. So it could have both been bitterness and like ptsd and trying to avoid them and being tough and walking with a hard look and a stump so they would not feel comfortable enough to try to speak to me. gt gtJust to say some messed up useless stuff. which is harder for me to get over. Mainly because I do not have any real friends or people who just like me. Only my siblings and parents. I have depended on them for a lot and that was where I went wrong. Trying to make them love things about me they just hated and they basically shuned me. For an example this may be tmi. But just to show some sick stuff my dad has bullied me about. Once I had a pad. For periods. And you know not to flush them. gt gtSo instead of like my mom she wraps it in the paper and puts it in a bag so it will not leak or anything and so you cannot see it in the trash. Now I was feeling bad and did not want to get one. So I got like basically the whole roll of tissue and wraped my pad in it. Now like in the next thirty mintues my dad was wodering where all the tissue went and freaking out. And he decided to look through the trash because he was trying to firgure out why it was all gone. And found a wad of tissue and then when seeing there was a pad init or it was bleeding through and then he like came out and asked if it was me. gt gtThen I said yeah that is mine. He said it was disgusting and that he did not want to see that. And then he grabbed me by the arm and like brang me in their mom and dads room and yelled at me. And like said it was gross and nasty and I looked at my mom and she was like what ever I am tired of you and then he ask what was wrong with my hair and I said my hair is fine. Then he got a mirror and was mockingly like does this look done and laughing. Then he said Id be shocked if I saw you in heaven. Over a pad with blood that he went looking for in the trash. gt gtThink he went and dug through the trash looking for shit. that is like me going and putting my hand in the toliet and finding shit and being shocked what did you expect you was going to find doing that. So that is just a taste of what he does. Trust me I do not always complain about every minor inconvenience. Then I do not want to be ew because God is God and can say what he wants. But I have an older sister she is 24 and is kidna fast and she was a teen mom. And I kind of judged her tho I was only jealous of her because dad loved her so much. Like anytime my sister would come around Id love seeing her and my niece. gt gtMore then all my siblings and mom. she is my half sister by the way only one who loved seeing her more was my dad. So that being said I still was jealous of her and it totally was not her fault. Now all this shit was in my head and I was bitter. and I kind of would take it out on my siblings not out loud but in my head. and I was angry at GOD AND MY FAMILY FOR WEEKS BLASPHEMYING AND STUFF BEING RUDE. And I decide to read the bible and then he had like passages for me cuz I blaspheymed and was trying so hard to be good. And then the bible had a passage about the virgins in israel doing a very horrible thing and saying as if it were a little thing they were more defiled then everyone idk. gt gtBut also it had one about ahloa and her sister and I knew that was for me tho I am not a whore. It was like this is the sins of your sister. And my golly that were totally describing my sister being a little fast eatting a lot and being pridful and kind of selfish. But then he said init she is better then you. Like it said your sister is like in all she has done better then you and for that momment it was like a badly written sitcom. You know like where the sad and depressed one keeps trying to show their good and better. gt gtAnd the other is care free and happy and does not care as much but some how ends up better then you and that is how this is God tried to paint me out to be this evil and envious person which sometimes I am. So that brings me to these questins like in my other post I do not like suprises I like to know things so I do not have to worry about them. I sont mind being told no I am not peter. But thinking your going to do or get something and then not is like not very good and I know you guys are so much more wiser then me and read the Bible more and listen so this is the question this maraggie supper of the lamb is said only blessed are those which are called. gt gtAnd I hate being left out of stuff. Tho my dad says some in heaven will not go now like saul when he was rejected from being king because of his disobediecne. I just wanted to know since I called the holy ghost evil and also I um publicly tried to slander him in a sneaky way online if you look at my other post you will see.. Dose that hurt my chances like is there any bible verse to back this thought of mine up just asking. And that last one is as you all know this see I read something about like in the greek bible translation it was a novum testamentum graece and it said I do always let go the sons of men the sins and the blasphemy as much as it is blasphemyed but he who blasphemys against the Holy Ghost has not let go but is guilty of an eternal sin. gt gtSo I also do not really want eteranal guilt so those are the only two questions thanks.

19702,19722,I do not even want to die that much. I just want the pain to stop. But it will not by itself. Just increasing and swirling together like the thoughts. ,Depression
19747,19767,I am just exhausted emotionally. I am on meds and they work for bit but then they stop. I am too embarrassed to make another appointment to get them fixed again. I feel like I am trapped in a never ending cycle. I am watching everyone around me grow up. I did not plan on making it this far so I did not make any future plans. Everyone else went to college and is graduating next summer. I have not even fucking started. Everyone else is moving out of their parents house. I cannot find a place to move to with jobs and rent I can make work. I just work a shitty cook job. And I am dumb and quit therapy. I do not know anymore. I am just in revolving door of confusion of what to do and it makes it so much worse. I do not know I am just rambling,Depression
19756,19776,honestly I do not want to be here anymore i am not living I am tired. I am losing weight losing self love. just constantly falling. detached from life,Depression
19762,19782,I used to be extremely hypersexual but it was frustrating because I was not getting any. Citalopram massively reduced by libido and made it impossible to orgasm but I did not mind this change at first. At one point I was taking 40mg which is the highest allowable dose.After tapering off my sexual function never fully returned and I kind of miss it. it is been over a year now. I was on the drugs for a few years.Prior to antidepressants even at the age of 27 I would get random erections. I would sometimes get so aroused I would HAVE to masturbate or I would be agitated and could not think about anything else. Not to get too graphic but I used to get a lot of precum and when I ejaculated I would squirt quite far often over my head and it would be A LOT of volume. It was easy to reach orgasm and when I did they were intense.Now the end of my dick is dry and lacks sensitivity. it is really hard to reach orgasm and I am significantly less aroused in the first place. I miss the thrill of trying not to cum prematurely. Now I cannot cum without vigorous stimulation and it does not even feel good. Did your libido never fully recover after quitting antidepressants?,Depression
19764,19784,So when I m alone I always get sad that nobody cares of me that I have nobody to talk about my problems but when there is people who starts caring about me b it gets so fucking annoying I get jealous of their other friends I do not even like seeing them fucking happy but when I push those people away I regret doing that and it is starts over and over fucking again Hate being around people but getting sad being lonely,Depression
19772,19792,I think to the point when I get tension headaches. And that is when I cannot think anymore. that is when I just have a headache and hate myself a lot without any logic. Although I still hate myself even when I think. For the things I cannot even control. I am such a loser. I was blessed to be born in Iran a 3rd world garbage county. And I was also blessed by being lgbt in this fucking place to spice it up my family is also broke and do not accept me. Sometimes I think my dad did not even want a kid.. But then again I keep thinking if I had anything that I ever wanted if all my issues disappear would I be happy? I do not know. Happiness feels like really non existent concept. it is all the naive happiness when I was a kid. I am like 17 now. It feels like nothing absolutely matters. I did not know what matters anymore except my 2 friends. But I feel like a damn burden with these amount of issues that I have how much I hate myself and how much of a loser I am. I am constantly thinking they are going be tired of me soon enough They are so kind and sweet but it feels like In the long run maybe even they would be happier to not have me.Thing is I think I do not want to die. I do not know why. It just seems like this is not the way. This is not it. Thoughts of offing myself keep popping to my head and make me feel like it can be a solution and it annoys me so much. But I want to live. I am just so lost and confused and I feel like Idk what is it that can be done. I just.. idk. I really do not know. I keep crying like a baby at times. With this broken sense of mine. Self hatred to death but I want to live,Depression
19822,19842,I may be stupid but quick question. If self worth is not determined by what you do what you have done and what others think of you then what is it determined by? Everyone says what its not determined by but no one says what it is? Also if it is not determined by other people what is the point to ur worth? What does determine self worth?,Depression

19844,19864,I just hate the place that I live in I hate engaging with people here their're so toxic and selfrighteous and I am tired of being interrupted by them every 10 minutes I just want to be alone for a second and enjoy doing things that I love but the paranoia prevents me for doing so.I have no friends to reach out to or spend time with I try to go out but I do not know where to go I feel like I am in prison.I am depressed for years because of this I told my mom about it in hope of recovery she told me she will look for a doctor but mouths have past now and I have not got any treatment she seems to not give a flying fuck about me it fucking hurts man.I just want to leave this place but I have wait a couple because I am still at school I want kill my self but the hope for a libration from this shithole keeps me patient I do not how to deal with this situation please help. I hate where I live,Depression
19847,19867,I have tried everything different medications meditating talking with a therapist weekly. And my doctor even labeled me as a anomaly. How am I supposed to find solace in someone else dealing with what I am if no one even knows what is wrong with me? I am sick of never enjoying anything I am sick of constant thoughts that are not mine 247. I am sick of crying over simple things for no reason. And I am sick of feeling like an outcast I am done. I have given up,Depression
19851,19871,I have been depressed since 14 people bullied me I have been told I am ugly short some how balding at young age I have been told all kind of shit even my family used to bully me and make fun of me calling me ugly i felt alone... now I am 17 yrs old still depressed every single time i find a solution it does not work maybe ill cheer up for a day or two but then get right back to it because of depression. So my actual question is is there hope like for real everybody told me there is and i should keep on going and never give up that kind of stuff but really I do not see anything changing the only thing that has changed is my overthinking anxiety insomnia and stress are worse that is all so should i just end it? Am i going to continue till my end of my life like this please tell me I will not. I have a quick question.,Depression

19917,19937,Do you ever wake up suicidal spend the day feeling suicidal and go to bed wishing you would never wake up again? I have been dealing with this feelings for a while now. I believe that things will get better that life will get easier but lately I kind of feel like it is not worth it to go through all of this mess just because i feel like i might get a glimpse of happiness in the far future. I just cannot take it anymore.I tried talking to some of my friends about this stuff they try to be nice and supportive but they cannot make me feel better. I know i should seek professional help but let us just say it is not an easy option for a person in my circumstances. What would you do if you were in my shoes? I feel like it is not worth it,Depression
19918,19938,little bit of background info I am a 25f arabmuslim who has never been in a relationship. i have typical arab features big black eyes long black hair etc. 170cm 80kg curvy I have been depressed since i was 16.4 months ago i lost a close friend of mine who never really appreciated me. i went into a spiral after that and realised no one really stuck around. I am a fairly good person who admits to my mistakes. I have been seeing a therapist and I have been working on myself and things have been going great but today i feel overwhelmed. lately I have been projecting my feelings into anyone i meet. my therapist chiropractor physiotherapisti chose them as males BECAUSE i wanted to see what it would feel like to have a man around me. they are all taken.I have recently fell for this guy i met online on clubhouse were a bunch of friends who hang out everyday and talk and hes so sweet to me i just told him i cannot go to sleep without hearing your voice and that that is weird to me and he said that i would change my mind when i wake upi took that as a no thanks. and i just started crying and have been crying the past two hours because a man has never admitted that he wants to be with me me or has been with me or love me or even loved me and proved it and i am realising i am so touch deprived that my depressions root because is being touch deprived and passion deprivedis this normal. why am i fucked up. i am so sad it hurts everyday. i make big scenarios in my head just to validate myselfwhat do i do. how do i get men to be attracted to a muslim girl who wears a hijab i cannot even take it off bc that is my religion every shot i shoot never goes according to plan. why do i feel like i need a mans validation why am i like this why do i project into people who want to help me i cannot stop crying at the fact that I have never felt passion,Depression
19921,19941,it is only my 2nd week on this new medication and I already fucking forgot it along with my whole backpack that I NEED for school. I seriously feel so beyond stupid and I cannot stop crying. hy the fuck am I like this?! I somehow always manage to find a way to fuck everything up. I am so sick of everything and I am so sick of even trying to get better. Why does everything have to feel like fucking shit even when everybody around me is having so much fucking fun and happy as hell I still feel fucking indifferent. I am so done with this BULLSHIT.Even writing all of this feels pointless and is making me feel worse venting does not even help anymore. Why is this happening to me? Why could not my life had just been fucking better? Why did stupid fucking people have to ruin my fucking brain as a kid?! And I cannot even fucking talk to anybody about it. I am so sick of everything I just want to feel good again and stop feeling so goddamn empty. I am so tired of being a burden. I would kill myself if it were not for how terrible my girlfriend would feel. I forgot my medication. Venting.,Depression
19934,19954,Its important to take your time when getting better considering mental health. But holy fuck I do not have anytime to get better. I am failing year 11 and if I keep going like this then I am going to have to repeat the year and I just do not know how I am going to cope with that. But I cannot get myself to do any of my work so what the fuck am I supposed to do? I cannot wait to get better because I am failing in the present and I really need to be better NOW not Fucking later down the line. An alternative would be dropling out and getting a job but frankly my anxiety makes going out hell so fuck that. I am going to therapy I am on antidepressants I have good friends and a good family what the fuck am I doing wrong????? I do not have enough time,Depression
19957,19977,I just want to know what its like just fucking once. I have gone my whole fucking life without it. My dad hit me more times than he hugged me. My mum did not give two shits about me tried to kill herself 3 times before I even turned 12 just to prove that point. And that is not to mention all the other shit they both put on me. Never even had friends growing up moved around too much just did my best to assimilate with new groups by wearing masks and leaving them behind just as quickly.Only ever had one friend in adulthood. Think she did care about me for a while but I fell in love with her and she did not feel the same way. Between that and my constant mentally ill bullshit guess I scared her away because she is barely spoken to me at all for almost 2 years now and I have not seen her in just as long.Never had a girlfriend either. cannot imagine it would be anything but a total fucking disaster and I do not think I can handle losing someone I actually care about because of my own bullshit again. Tried using shit like Tinder but it fucking sucks. Besides I know I am not good enough for a relationship so what the fuck am I even trying to accomplish by asking women out? Sex is just fucking pointless to me at this point so I really do not know what the end goal is and I just stop bothering.I know people say you have got to love yourself first but I do not know what the fuck that feels like because I have nothing to go off. Feels like I am caught in an endless cycle of cannot be loved till I love myself and cannot love myself until I learn what being loved is like. Its fucking torture. do not even think it fucking matters anymore think I have lost the ability to be around people anymore anyway. cannot handle it. Every time I have tried to make myself be around people or make new friends I just get fucking agitated with everyone and want to be left the fuck alone. cannot even hold down a job anymore because I cannot speak to the public on a regular basis without doing shit that gets me fired. People just aggravate me and I do not know how to fix that. Medication does not fix it does not do fucking anything neither does therapy. Guess there is no solution.Just so fucking sick of being completely alone in the world having to do all this shit by myself every fucking day with nothing ever getting better or easier. And its a fucking catch 22 because the longer this shit goes on the harder it gets to be around anyone the worse my truest issues get and the more I realise I am probably always going to be fucking unstable to some degree and Ill never be good enough to have relationships and shit because I have got nothing to offer but chaos and selfdestruction. I just wish one fucking person loved me,Depression
19976,19996,Recently diagnosed with mild depression. Its day 3 and I have started to really feel like myself for the first time in months. My doc told me it usually takes two weeks to work so I am pretty confused because I am already feeling completely different. what is going on? I am only on day 3 of Prozac and feel AMAZING,Depression
20034,20054,Recently a lot has been going on in my life. I gained 5 new mental disorders lost my SO lost interest in most the things I used to care about just in time for me to get a call telling me Congrats! Your application and interview went perfect! you will start this weekend! Now with everything piling up I do not even want to start. I feel horrible because my best friend got me the job but I just do not want it anymore. I do not want anything. I just want to sleep and cry. Finally got a job now I do not even want to start it.,Depression
20053,20073,For some extra context I was also diagnosed with GAD ADHD and ASD 4 for the price of one! and I have been on meds for 6 months. My highfunction self gets mad every single time that I cannot get out of bed which is literally almost every single day every time I eat buttered toast for the 5th time during the day instead of actual dinner and every time I run out of underwear to wear bc I was too tired to handwash them in the shower with me whenever I actually did manage to get in the shower. WHY cannot I JUST GET BETTER??? was not diagnosis supposed to fix me?? Now that I know what is going on with my brain should not things be easier??? But instead they got so much harder. And I fucking cannot right now. I am so damn tired of it all. Was diagnosed with Dysthymia persistent depressive disorder 8 months ago and I am mad at myself for not getting better yet,Depression
20077,20097,I know that doing nothing all day in my room not going to change my life. I need to get the fuck out of my bed and find a job but imagining myself walk out in public just makes me trembling. I hate to say this but i do hate myself. I am a coward.,Depression
20095,20115,Is this what life is? Just going through the motions chore after chore for the rest of my life? Just one meaningless day after another? I ruined my life. I hate myself. I have no passion for life no hope no dreams anymore. I lost my chance at true love. I have no worthwhile future. I do not think I can do this anymore.,Depression
20105,20125,its been 9 years since i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when i was 8. i also have adhd. since my diagnosis so many terrible things have happened and i am now also diagnosed with bipolar ptsd mdd and GAD. every day it gets worse. I have been inpatient hospitalized 3 times and am on a path to being hospitalized again. my question is why. why am i still living in this pain? i go to my therapy appointments I have done dbt done cbt tried animal therapy i take my meds and i actively try to get better. but I am still in pain. i dwell and idk how to stop. so many people have left me and I am not longer any fun to hangout with so nobody invites me anymore and I have spent this entire summer alone. I have tried everything at this point i use my coping skills and they just do not work. i miss the days before my first hospitalization. sure i was depressed but it was nothing like it is now. i had people who loved me and cared about me. now I am just completely institutionalized. i cannot seem to stay out of the hospital. my life is so pathetic and that is why i come on here and rant about how terrible things are. because reddit is the only place i can be fully honest. i have another suicide plan but knowing my luck it will not work and ill wake up in the emergency room again. what is the point in life if you are in constant pain Why is nothing working,Depression
20134,20154,I do not have much to say. I started cutting myself again and I cannot really tell anybody and get it off my chest so I will just confess here. I started self harming again,Depression
20138,20158,I think this could also be posted in unpopular opinion. If I decide to take a nap and do not set an alarm I can easily sleep 34 hours and still get to sleep at bedtime. I usually hit snooze though and sleep a little longer. Its very rarely that I have trouble getting to sleep at bedtime after taking a nap. I assume its the depression and anxiety I deal with or a combination of this and my PCOS but I have always been this way. Anyone else relate or thoughts on why this is? One does not take a nap without setting an alarm.,Depression
20173,20193,Just another boring post here I guessI cannot even remember the last time I was actually happy. I feel like happiness is something only others can have not me. I am just waiting waiting waiting for a random event to help turn my life aroundIve always had a fear of dating I do not know why. I have always fet ugly I lost my hair at 17 and I never truly got over it. Always felt like an outsider an alien past my peak at 17I met a very cute girl at work 5 years ago and we got super close and for the first time in my life I was getting attention reciprocated to me from someone I loved. Long story short she turned out to be a real ho and took everything from me including my last shred of insanityIm in my mid 30s and oh so alone I cannot bear it. I have totaled two cars in a year gotten several STDs from escorts and have yet to have a real relationship or have sex with someone that was not an escort at my advanced age. I do not know what to do I cannot bear it They said my 30s would be great. All I have is crippling depression. My life is spiraling out of control,Depression
20296,20316,Want to lay in bed all day. Everything feels pointless do not even feel like trying,Depression
20328,20348,I just drank a bunch and spilled my guts to my husband about how miserable I am every day and how I low key want to die. I feel super Embarrassed and hopeless and I do not know how to proceed.Everyday of my life has been so exhausting and meaningless except when I get the rare chance to lay with my husband or go get taco bell as sad as that sounds its my reality How do I find the will to exist on a day to day basis especially when my brain has been wired to be miserable for as long as I can remember?I feel like I cannot go on much longer. I have never seriously considered suicide before now but i just want to rest. I am beyond lost,Depression
20334,20354,After crying your brain releases endorphins so you tend to cheer up after letting it out but I actually hate this feeling.Me feeling better does not change the fact that my mental space is completely fucked filled with constant anxiety suicidal thoughts past regrets and extreemly low selfesteem.Me feeling better does not change the fact that everything I do is never good enough and my parents are always disappointed in me while the people that I am lucky enough to call friends are all hundreds of times more talented social and driven than I ever could be.My parents' biggest mistake was not in how they raised me or how they acted around me their biggest mistake was having me in the first place. I detest the society I was forced into and I have nothing to live for in order to tolerate this society.Without a dream to strive for or someone to share life with there is nothing for me here. I want to die but I do not want to get hurt. Man I actually hate that feeling of feeling better after crying.,Depression
20349,20369,No one cares whether I am happy sad angry excited anxiouswhatever.They care that I am alive because if I killed myself they would not get to talk to me anymore or they would look like a bad parent they would be lonely they would be traumatized etc. etc. They care that I am working volunteering paying rent taking care of my appearance going to therapy etc. etc.They do not care how I feel.I posted something on my main account asking about how to talk about feelings because I really genuinely do not know and I am feeling very alone and all three comments so far can be surmised with do not. This is pretty much the same reaction I have gotten from everyone in my life. Even my therapist has asked why it is so important to me that people understand how I am feeling.I do not need people to understand. I just need someone to care. it is deeply deeply upsetting to me to think that it makes no difference to anyone in my life besides me obviously whether I go through life constantly on the verge of suicide taking meds having panic attacks and sobbing alone on my floor every couple of days as I have been since I was about eleven years old... I am now 25. or whether I go through life feeling generally content and lovedjust so long as I am functional and do not take up too much space with my emotions.Every time I try to talk about how I feel I get shut down the subject gets changed the other person starts complaining about their own life or I am told that I am upsetting them. When I was fourteen I told my friend that I was cutting myself she told our priest and the priest CALLED THE POLICE and my parents and had me detained until I swore up and down that I would never ever do it ever again of course I did lmao. I still do sometimes. That was the most extreme reaction I ever got but others have been similar. I had someone I would been in a relationship with for MONTHS ghost me after I cried to them over the phone for instance. I tried calling three different friends for help while I was hallucinating from alcohol withdrawal a little over a year ago and literally Every Single One Of Them had a response like Um... that really sucks... Good thing you are quitting though. Okay here is what happened to ME todayit is just so frustrating. Even when you Google how to talk about your feelings you will get a lot of results telling you that no one cares.I do not know. It makes me want to end it sometimes. I am just so fucking sick of being all alone. I want to just LOSE IT and scream at everyone sometimes but I do not think that would be fair. I know it is ultimately my responsibility to cope with my depression but... I cannot. I just cannot do it without any support. I have been trying for so long.I have been in therapy for years. I take meds. I exercise. I eat healthy. I try to get enough sleep. And now I have been sober for about a year. I even tried to make a career change but I have discovered I do not really want to do this either it is not the job. it is me. it is depression. I am just about ready to give up.Anyway. I am ranting. I did not know what else to do. Have a nice night if for some reason you read this hahaha ,Depression
20362,20382,Hello Reddit.Forgive me if this comes across as messy and disorganized but I am trying my best to collect my thoughts on this thing that stresses me out so much. And I am not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this and I apologize in advance if this topic is too severe to be posted here. I got no one and nowhere to turn to so please bare with me. A little background My brother has been living abroad for quiet a while before I was born. He in his late 20s came back to visit when I was around 1112 the same age when I started going through puberty. Long story short he was sexually assulting me when I was asleep but fortunately it did not go as far as rpe. Back then I did not know what to think of it or what to do as my parents never told me anything regarding the topic of sex. The act did make me uncomfortable and confused but I did not give it much thought and just ignored it. it all hit me later when I was around 15.Now the said brother is going to be visiting again sometime soon and my anxiety and suicidal thoughts are over the roof because I do not know what to do in a situation like this. I tired to forgive him but he was a grownass man an adult he knew exactly what he was doing and coming to think of it I cannot even imagine myself doing that to anyone let alone a child. So that process was not a success as you can tell. To be frank just the thought of me being under the same roof as him scares me so much. My family does not believe in therapy and this is my first time talking about it ever. So if you have any advice please do not hesitate to let me know. Thank you so much for your time. TW sexual assault,Depression
20368,20388,My depression just or sadness just kind of left one morning. It feels so good! My smiles and laughs are genuine! Its been like that for 3 days now hopefully this rain of happiness continues! This will probably be the last time I post here so goodbye and thank you everybody who gave me advice sayonara. Gone.,Depression
20380,20400,I graduated college a few years ago but it was the worst time of my life. Became depressed first day because of growing up leaving all my friends and taking harder courses because I was in Special Ed since elementary. My therapist involuntarily sent me to the hospital for a few days I could never trust anyone not even myself again thanks to her. Had to change majors and take an extra year because I kept failing classes. Graduated but I have to pay off student loans but I do not have a full time job. Used to work 3 part time jobs but due to the pandemic I am only left with 1. I feel like I ruined my own life by going to college wasting my parents money taking courses I did not want to take like Italian I wanted to learn Japanese all to make them happy. I feel like I failed them and myself. I could have gone to a technical school or learned a trade or even gone to community college with all my friends but I chose the traditional university route like my sister except she has a Phd and a good paying job director of a childrens museum meanwhile I cannot even get unemployment and living in my moms. I sometimes wish I was dead. Been feeling this way since I was 18.Any thoughts? I feel like College has ruined me. 26M,Depression
20390,20410,I am wide awake thinking about life. A 20 years old with no concrete plan in life. No motivation to do things. I barely have any friends. I am studying a degree that my parents want me to. I have no purpose in life. I have never truly been happy. I always live in my head. This small fantasy world that I made up from the expectations that I want myself to be. I feel like a fraud. I am useless and good at literally nothing. Every time I get out of my head the reality hits and I feel like my world is falling apart. Sometimes I just want to be okay. I do not need to be happy. 433am,Depression
20406,20426,I was about 14 30 now when I was first diagnosed with depression and put on antidepressants. I used to do this thing where I would come home from school every day and cry from the moment I walked in the door until I fell asleep at night. I would literally go about my entire day dinner homework whatever crying. Obviously that is not normal and I really internalized that it was not. But my life at the time was also not normal. I had a very abusive childhood and my emotional responses were all normal of a kid in my situation. And now when I think about all that it just makes me fucking angry that my family's reaction to all of that was to put me on antidepressants when it was pretty clear what I was depressed about. There was not anything wrong with me or my brain. The problem was my situation. For 15 years it is been the same story. Try this drug try that drug go to this therapist and that therapist and rehash the same shit over and over and over again. Nothing really works because really very little has changed other than the medications and therapist. I still have a hard time being with family and I hate feeling completely trapped in the state and country I live in. Now that I have finally got a job that pays well enough for me to take a step back and see what I want I realize that what I want is to not spend 40 hours a week for the rest of my life working. it is a total scam. and I think it is the real reason a lot of people are depressed. it is a depressing system we live in so much so that they have to drug us to keep us from killing ourselves. After all who is going to do the work if we all just off ourselves? I have been on more antidepressants than I can count and I truly believe it emotionally stunted me. Your emotions are supposed to be like an ocean. Mostly calm but sometimes there are waves. For me if I was not on something they were always a total tsunami. I really think this is because I was on antidepressants at such an early age when it was important for me to be learning how to deal with those on my own. I did not and it really fucked me over as an adult. Recently I was put on Abilify which seemed fine until I lost the ability to laugh at or enjoy anything. Normally I would describe myself as a very passionate person but that is all gone. I stopped taking it two months ago. I still cannot really hold long conversations. I do not really give a shit about anything. I guess my point to all of this is that I think a lot of us who are depressed actually have fairly good reason to be. I do not think it is just some disease that is just happened to become common in humans recently. it is a result of how we are living our lives and what we are able to do. I have always internalized my depression as something that was just my fault but I think it is really just a result of not being in control of the world around me and not really being able to do anything about all the problems in it. We were never supposed to have 247 news about every fucked up thing that happens in the world blasted at us constantly. I hate going to the store and knowing that merchandise could literally be called not made by slaves but it would totally be made by slaves. Our systems make it nearly impossible to live ethically and that is too fucking depressing for medications to fix. I have no solution for this I just think maybe sometimes depression is actually a justified response to fucked up world. not advocating for not taking meds obviously there are people who need them. I am starting to think there is not really anything wrong with me..,Depression
20472,20492,Hello everyone i hope everyone has been feeling a little less shit than usual. Recently i have been upset about being numb. I hate that i have not felt any real emotions except occasional cryingsadness for years. Does anyone know how to cope with that make yourself feel a little bit better? Thank you.. Asking for advice.,Depression
20491,20511,Finally set a date to end my life in August. Just quit my job and currently sitting in my car it feels like such a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.I want to enjoy the last few weeksmonths of my life doing things I have always wanted to do. I have a 5000 credit limit on my credit card and I am going to max it out before I go. I am thinking of going to a nice steakhouse maybe sushi a couple times skydiving and a couple other things right now. going to add some more stuff as I think of it. Just quit my job going to enjoy my last few weeks on my own terms,Depression
20493,20513,Tired when I wake up tired during the day tired after work tired when I go to bed.Just want to stay in bed and never get up again.Feel like my head explodes it cannot handle every day business anymore.Was very closed to write my therapist an mail but he has holidays so I will not disturb.Every time when I feel sad and tired the other day I think I get better but tbh I never was. Otherwise I would feel a lot different.Afraid that one day I lose my job or my home etc. Everything goes well currently. But I am so fucked up my body is fucked up and my brain is dead. Tired all day long,Depression
20506,20526,I have been struggling with my mental health for a few years and have made very little headway in finding a way out. I suspect it is more complex than simply depression however I am continually being let down by the NHS mental healthcare and am prepared to go private. I have decided it would be appropriate to acquire a diagnosis so I can try to undergo therapy or medication that may be more suitable to whatever it is I am dealing with. Could anyone recommend any good psychiatrists or anyone else who is trained to diagnose mental health conditions in the East Midlands area of the UK? Good psychiatrists in the UK East Midlands,Depression
20509,20529,I am depressed but I do not want to kill myself. I am just depressed. I do not complain about it. Sometimes I feel good. Sometimes I feel bad. I get really bad manic depression sometimes but my face ALWAYS gets commented on. Cheer up you look lile you are about to cry even though I am not... I could be feeling great that day and somebody will make a comment. I have been hearing it constantly at work by new people I have met. Like I are not happy but I am not trying to be Unhappy and I wish It did not annoy other people! But today really got to me never had this in my entire life. Foreign guy to my country walks past me and starts laughing and fake crying while making a crying gesture... only me and him as I am walking past him. At first I am thinking he must be on a phone call... no way some guy is this loopy and could be so cocky...I could of seriously hurt this guy. I wanted to throw everything away and seriously hurt this guy. What the fuck is wrong with people or is it just me Another man walked past me today...I was very close to doing something stupid.,Depression
20548,20568,The one thing i hate most about being undiagnosed is i get all these things to help me cope. Like take a walk or do this when I am feeling depressed. I have a new therapist who is a temporary one while we look for a permanent one. And so i cannot get meds even if i wanted. But people do not understand that I am depressed most days and i hate the days that I am actually happy and forget about my problems because the depression is soon to come back. Its weird. I have a boyfriend and we have a great time sometimes and other times he sees me upset and wants to help but he cannot. I hate when people offer ways to get through it when they do not understand that it effects everyone differently. And yes my bf does make me feel better when he stops what hes doing to try and comfort me for whatever reason I am depressed. He trys his best to help me get through it and I have asked for help from this therapist and online I have googled ways to help. Most of them are the same of go for a walk get some sun light do something you enjoy doing. But the hard part is finding the motivation to do any of that and its like they do not understand that. My bf kind of gets it because hell come cuddle or hell rub my back because he knows its hard to get out of bed for me. I am just tired of people thinking that everyone with depression is the same. I am tired of people assuming,Depression
20570,20590,When I am in a manic episode everything seems possible I have so much energy I barely sleep 5 hours a day I am working around the clock and compliments from my workcolleagues for my productivity is driving the manic state even higher. I go out clubbing and my altered selfesteem makes me appear more charming and attractive to women.As usually a few weeks ago the lack of sleep physically degraded my body so much that life has collapsed like a house of cards again. I called in sick for a week work piles up my home became a mess friends called me asking me for a reason why I am suddenly not responding to them to ashamed to tell them that I am mentally ill they think I am just sick of them and they stop talking to me altogether which is accelerating depression even more.I am used to all of that but the reason why I am writing today is because in my manic state I met a wonderful girl at work. We laughed together we partied together. We worked together. We became good friends and I fell in love with her I never experienced love like that. And I lost her not because I am a psycho which I am I lost her because I shared my feelings for her and she did not feel the same way. At first as a good friend would say she assured me that this would not affect our friendship but after all she avoided being with me. I believe she started seeing me as just another guy hitting on her.What bothers me most is that she never even saw my depressive side knowing that even my best was not good enough. Sorry for this long post. Struggling with manic depression for a few years now.,Depression
20597,20617,Why do I always feel so lonely to the point of wanting to be gone? Guess I can be lost for a couple of months without anyone looking for me. L O N E,Depression
20603,20623,I been through a lot of changes lately I just quit the perfect job with a really toxic boss. I could not even talk to her bc she wanted all written in case that she needed to prove that I was the one that did something wrong. I ended my long distance relationship 3 months ago he was a completely different person when he returned to the us. We are still in the meddle if the pandemic here in mexico. I am super scared of not having anything right now.... I still feel is for the best this changes but I am so depressed that I do not have a partner to rely on or work right now.... it is been so hard to change,Depression
20604,20624,I woke up today not wanting to be alive anymore. Its been a couple of months since I have felt this way. Ugh. Today is a really bad day.,Depression
20642,20662,Currently in a meeting at work. Going through a bad tick right now of negative feelings very common for mehave highs and then super lows but as far as most people are concerned nothing is wrong with me because I do not show viable symptoms. I wish I could flip the switch back to good mood time so badly but I just sit here constantly telling myself bad things about myself with serious apathy and hopelessness while trying to keep composure at work. I know physical pain can because depression too but at least you can vent a little without people thinking your just sad and the shit in your head causes 0 pain. I have basically resorted to writing what I am feeling in my Notes app in my phone because its the only time I feel like I can say how I am actually feeling without feeling like someone thinks I am just over exaggerating or feel bad for even complaining about anything. So much pain but kept silent,Depression
20647,20667,I do not know. Does this even make sense? I want to end my life but I am afraid what will happen after that. Nobody knows.,Depression
20652,20672,Life has taught me that if I can do something it is not called talent it just means someone else could do it too. Depression,Depression
20690,20710,So I am out of town and realized I forgot my medication. it is been four days and will be four more before I get home. And this morning I caught myself thinking how I cannot wait to die which I have not done in months!! I am also super irritated and every interaction I have with people is getting on my last nerve. do not worry I have no intention of harming myself but man my brain sucks!! Lol. Why cannot it just behave and think happy thoughts? My brain is a dangerous place.,Depression
20693,20713,hey humansgive me your thoughts on this please.i want to become a narcissist someone who think of himself as the greatest person someone who look in the mirror and jerk to his beauty!depression make us the opposite of a narcissist and make us hate ourselfs. and make us ruminate over how fucked up we are.so i will start ruminating on how great i am i will take an action i do during the day and make it the greatest action i human ever did.i hope you get my pointi made 4 alarms every few hours to remind me to jerk to myself to my greatness.fyi i am on meds for depression. becoming a Narcissist is the way out,Depression
20702,20722,I really cannot handle this anymore. I truly feel like I am not needed on the face of this planet. My own mother has the ability to turn any positive situation into a negative one. I am the only child and since we are in a lockdown currently my mum is the only person I talk to and share things with but I just do not understand why would she turn anything I say into a negative statement and has the audacity to tell me things that are not remotely helpful.A few days ago I told her that I am depressed and I do not know how to deal with things. I am unmotivated to work and I end up sleeping more than being awake just so i can escape reality. She just said you cannot be like that. work harder be motivated... followed by another 30 or so minutes of unhelpful trash that came out of her mouth. When I tell her what is happening in the country I am from Malaysia btw she immediately turns it against me and says did you do something? do not go say things on social media in a very condescending way which hurts my feelings. you are my mother for fucks sake how can you not know what type of person am I? I only have Instagram nothing else. Even on that platform I rarely post pictures. Even If i do it is memes on my stories section.Every fucking thing is negative. I am truly embarrassed by the fact that I used to be a fucking racist asshole. I clearly see where I got that from. My parents. They do not just say things like that guy is a lazy person or Person A did not pay up on time they actually say things like this that guy is malay that is why he is lazy and Person A did not pay. Indians what? Normal lah. it is truly disgusting to hear this in my very own home. I hate the fact that I was born into a racist cunt of a family.On top of all this the ministers in Malaysia are embarrassing us on an international level. Ordinary citizens are dying raising white flags asking for help because they no longer have food at home. But the ministers are saying that instead of raising white flags we should pray. What in the motherfucking fuck are these ministers thinking? Those who end up helping these affected people are given fines amounting to thousands of ringgits. Ministers can go to France or cross states when we are forced to be in a lockdown and stay at home. If we as ordinary citizens cross the 10km mark from our home addresses we would get a fine of RM10000 for flouting movement control order rules but when ministers do it they get a tiny RM1000 fine which to them is like RM10. Make a mistake and you can immediately be fined on the spot. Guess what my country does? They give RM15000 fines to those who raised white flags. Mind you those who raise white flags HAVE NO MONEY TO EVEN EAT. They do not have jobs they have families and yet when they raise white flags they get this shit. RM15000 is USD 3578!!I am truly heartbroken seeing all this shit going on in the country and in my very own home I have no peace. I cry myself to sleep most nights and pray to god to save others. Save the poor. I lock myself up in my room for more than 20 hours a day only going downstairs to get food. When I do go speak to my parents I get negativity. I hate this life and I do not want a life like this. I have friends but it seems like they are unresponsive towards my messages or calls. I have reached out to some of them and I got nothing. Just blue ticked. I feel lonely man. I just want to end this and go to sleep. I cannot take it anymore,Depression
20708,20728,I want to die been thinking about it a lot its nothing in my life going too bad at the moment but its just been a constant thought in my head. Id be playing videos games something I enjoy but the thought would come again and again idk,Depression
20710,20730,Hello guys this is my first time making a post and first time talking about this but I felt comfort in the anonymous environment so firstly I have been having feelings of sadness and loneliness for a while now maybe a couple years and I just feel like I cannot trust anyone even my closest friends of years and years of friendship because I am so scared of being left venerable and sometimes I just feel like all the shit inside me just gets to a point where it blocks the light at the end of tunnel and sometimes I just feel like I am in a room enclosed by sandstone and my tears slowly erode away the stability and one day its all going to collapse and I am going to try and kill myself again but the thing is I do not want to all I want is to have my old life back where I could wake up and look forward to the future instead of now where when I wake up I just think of how shit I am of a person and how worthless I am for some fucking reason I have mentally tortured myself into thinking I need to protect people and if I cannot be there for the people I care about I am better off dead but to be honest I do not think anyone would notice or care and sometimes I feel like i cannot trustas in be around them or even talk to anyone because at any moment they might throw me under the bus I find myself always looking over my shoulder and its eating me inside. I am really hell bent on joining the military to get away from this place just so I can go die a death that will not make other people think how much of a worthless piece of shit I am and recently I have been really abusing drugs to numb everything like how I am using weed a lot more combined with alcohol and sometimes the harder drugs just so I can numb my body and feel maybe a inch of happiness I do not know what I am going to do probably just go end it because I do not see myself getting any further I do not know what to do anymore,Depression
20728,20748,Good days are few and far between I am exhausted and feel like garbageBack to sleep hopefully forever. Its going to be one of those days,Depression
20737,20757,Man I am fucking tired of shit. I liked a girl now she is dating my best friend. I see that shit every fucking day and it makes me fucking demotivated to do shit anymore. And all i can do is be happy for him while drowning in my own misery. Fuck life,Depression
20739,20759,my life has gone so down hill. i had a great 9th grade year with my friends and boyfriend. then i got depressed and wasted my whole 10th grade year being sad i isolated myself and stop taking care of myself and become moodier. I am now going into 11th grade and i feel sad cus i feel like I am too old and no longer a kid anymore i cannot have a fun highschool experience. apart of me feels like there is a part missing from me from not having a fun 10th grade experience now i feel like i have no chance. i feel like my friends stopped liking me everybody has. i changed so much I am so much quieter idk what to do anymore. i wasted my 10th high school year.,Depression
20743,20763,Yet people will not stop telling me that I can be happy if I just try acting like I have not been trying my whole fucking life. I am not a quitter for accepting reality. Its not my fault I cannot improve my life,Depression
20765,20785,This is not a joke. This is not a troll. I am in desperate need of help. I cannot find any reason to keep going on. I am very close to giving up and this time I am sure of it. I even freaking went to the store and bough supplies. I cannot do this anymore. I do not want to go thru with this but i do not see another option. Please. Help. I need help.,Depression
20792,20812,I do not know how much longer I can go on tbh I do not like talking about things like this but recently I have found a sort of comfort in the anonymity of reddit. This sickness is taking over me I feel empty I feel gross I just feel so mad all the time. I wake up and I am mad that I did life is just a long waiting game but I have nothing to wait for. I stopped taking my meds and stopped going to therapy cold turkey because it was not helping. But now I have just spiraled out of control every moment is spent thinking of my emptiness. I really just want it to end. Staying up until 6 am crying and then sleeping till the afternoon sometimes I feel like I do not exist I graduated high school and felt like I got robbed of what I thought it would be I never attended a party had a group of friends longer than 6 months at a timehad a couple dudes who would hang around me and use me for drugs but I was naive so I thought it was different and they wanted to be friends and I have never kissed a girl let alone had sex. I remember my therapist asking every time if I had suicidal thoughts I always replied no but I felt so alienated by that I already had plans for it and thought that everyone was suicidal everyone said there for a while ah I am going to kms at the slightest inconvenience I would always say it in that notion but I would always feel that thought build up into a real action. Idk what life has in store or even how much I have left sometimes I really wish my life could have been different with some sort of meaning. Oh well you got to play your cards This is getting to be too much,Depression
20817,20837,Hi my names jay I am feeling depressed I have been feeling like this for quite a while I am feeling down,Depression
20829,20849,I have been struggling with several mental disorders for about five years. I am terrified of the feeling of death but cannot help but almost crave the actual release I would gain. My intrusive thoughts have been especially bad and I have found myself quite literally staring off thinking about death to spite people how my family would recover and even writing a note in my head. I feel so guilty for the few that genuinely care about me but it almost feels like the best revenge I could get on others. I do not like to hurt people often which is how I can tell I am on the edge. I am scared. The anxiety makes me scared but at the same time the depression makes me not care?,Depression
20832,20852,I am severely depressed and for several reasons cannot go to therapy but I really cannot go on like this. Where I live I can buy antidepressants such as Prozac with any prescriptions and I feel like I might fall apart if I do not take any actions I am just scared of taking anything and feeling worse than I do right now. Can someone please help me? Should I selfmedicate?,Depression
20855,20875,I fake it. I get up. Do work. Workout. Cook. Socialize. A good day by anyone's standards. Then I lay down a just say I wish I was dead. That day was not worth living. I wish I had never existed. And it is never going to get better. And those are the good days. How much longer do I have to stick around? Even on my best days.,Depression
20880,20900,I legit just have been so depressed. I try not to bottle up my feelings and such but I just do not feel better just sad all the time. I do have happy moments ofc but just having this overarching feeling of sadness. I am just hella depressed,Depression
20912,20932,One of those NPCs from a side quest not the main story. Thanks for stopping by. I really enjoyed spending time with you. You gave me a big part of my life even though I am not a big part of yours. I know I did not really impact your life but you really impacted mine. Maybe you do not feel that close to me but I really care about you. I would do almost anything to help guide you on your way but I am just a stepping stone on your path.that is ok because I was happy while I was playing the part. I could not possibly expect anything in return because I know I am not enough. it is ok because what I had to offer was limited so my time with you would be short. I do not have the tools to join you on your journey.Even if I could tell you what you mean to me I know you cannot stay. The other NPCs can help you along the way. Maybe you will even pick up a coop player or a love interest along the way.I hope I helped. At the very least I hope you can forget me. I could not live with myself if I did you harm.The main story awaits. For you. Tell the next one to wake me up when I can be useful again.Ok it is not a perfect analogy but I have had a bit to drink and am having a bad day so shut up lol. Love you all. I feel like an NPC in everyone else's story mode,Depression

20940,20960,I am completely lost at this point. I finished school got a diploma in hospitality management and realised it was a complete waste and have no interest in that industry anymore. Now I am 20 floating around minimum wage jobs lost af. I just feel like time is running out and am heading nowhere in life. I do not know what career I want to do and am to scared to take the jump. I feel like there are infinite paths infront of me and each lead somewhere but I am to scared I will pick the wrong one like I did with hospo. I tell myself I am trying to take it slow and figure it out so I do not rush into anything bad But doing nothing makes me feel so empty and voided. Expecicialy that most people around me have some career there working towards. Completely lost in life at 20years old,Depression
20942,20962,I have no motivation for anything. I do not want to do anything but lay in bed and scroll on my phone. I do not eat properly or take care of myself. I have things I should be doing like cooking cleaning exercising etc but laying in bed doing nothing is much more appealing to me. I get its okay to do this every once in awhile but I feel like I am in this rut where its happening everyday. No motivation,Depression
20958,20978,I have none left absolutely none left. I have been struggling with depression and other mental illnesses for so long and I have no one to talk to. So please just give me one more reason to live. Please just give me a reason to live,Depression
20986,21006,Tw rpe..Hello guys I know it is weird to post this here but I do not really know anywhere else to vent my frustration.I am an almost 22 year old female but 5 years ago I was in a very very toxic dangerous and abusive relationship with a 18 year old that shortly after we finally broke up red a 12 year old boy. He sent me pictures of them together and all that type of fucked up shit. It was very traumatic and to this day it haunts me.I finally spoke up about the situations I went through and de rpe of the kid about 2 years ago mainly out of fear. I got a lot of backlash for not speaking up earlier I got called many ugly things but the thing that hit me the worst was that this guy had a female best friend that we will call C.C called me a liar and defended my abuser in any way she could denying he would ever do such horrible things despite having screenshots of how abusive he was to me and literally pictures of him with the kid he abused. She also called herself a feminist and her standing against me put lots of other women against me so I ended up deleting every post where I talked about what happened and even deleted my old Facebook and Instagram accounts for that reason. Police where involved in this too but I dropped the charges I just did not want to know anything about this anymore. Now this was 2 years ago but today I was scrolling down Instagram and stumbled across C's art account and while I was looking at her drawings I saw she had made Sally face fanart and talked about how much she loved the game and Sal the main character of the game.I really do not like gatekeeping and I understand she has the right to like whatever she wants just like I do and the more people know and play Sally Face the better as it is an indie game and I want the creator to receive as much support as possible.But this really hit me like a bucket of cold water. I know I should not have gone through her account but I was not expecting to see this at all. Now I cannot stop myself of thinking of both C and my abuser whenever I see something related to the game. I know it is stupid but I feel like one of my favorite things was taken off me or at least stained by all those memories and I feel awful. It is ruined. My depression has been acting up the last few days I think it has to do with the cold and cloudy weather as it is winter where I live and I always seem to have a harder time during cold seasons and this just made me feel even worse I feel like I cannot escape them or the memories. I have been in bed all day crying. it is pathetic. I am an adult crying over someone else liking my favorite game. I found out my abuser's best friend is a fan of my favorite indie game and I have been crying all day,Depression
21089,21109,I am trying so hard to avoid selfdestructive behavior. Drinking selfharming engaging with people I should not. Wallowing. it is getting harder and harder to avoid. Every day I feel myself losing my grip a little more and soon I am going to falter and do something stupid. And the coping mechanisms are becoming less and less effective. I know the path I am on. I know where it goes.I know all of this but I am powerless to stop it. Selfdestructive behavior,Depression
21096,21116,Hello I am not sure where to begin so I guess Ill start with I am a father of two beautiful girls. 2 years old one 1 month old I grew up without a father so I promised myself I would not ever leave my children If I had became a father and I will not ever do that I want to be apart of their lives and be an active role I have a wonderful fianc who loves and adores me who does everything a man could ever dream of. This sounds like a picture perfect family or a mans perfect dream however I do not feel happy the depression started when she became pregnant and I know it makes me a terrible person to feel this way.. I have been suppressing the depression or emotional thoughts and put on a smile on my face because this is what my role as a father is for the last 2 years it has not gone away and I cannot talk about it to my spouse because I am afraid I will hurt her feelings.I have no idea what is wrong with me but I spend so many hours of the day feeling so numb I feel happy with my kids for a short moment but then I fade away into an endless void.I feel like I am not in a good mental state and it concerns me Depression in dads,Depression
21110,21130,I have had my thoughts about suicide however I am trying to withstand them and not think about them.I do not have a good connection with my dad and I often think about how much happier I would be if my parents were together even though they split up for the benefit of them both. it is sad that I do not have a strong connection with my dad In fact I do not really have a strong connection to anyone as no matter how hard I try or how hard I want to have a conversation with someone it goes barely anywhere and overall I am not very social and it really tears me down. I am also very self conscious and I do not like my looks my thoughts my actions and overall I do not like myself. I would have probably ended it all but I am still young and I do not want to harm my mom or my sister as I am close to them.Also recently my sister said I do not know what I would do if you were not here this really made me think about the impact of my suicide and also about how I tried my best to comfort her when she was self harming which helped her get out of the dark place she was in.I love my mother and sister dearly and they are the reason I am still here. I do not want to be alive but I do not want to be dead,Depression
21122,21142,I just want someone to tell me it is alright I got enough. That ending my suffering is a good thing. Just someone to understand. why cannot anyone just be on my side ?,Depression
21144,21164,For those who are not aware England lost in the final game of the European Championships tonight and I am obviously extremely disappointed but I find myself wondering why I am in this position. I have sort of accepted that the best way I can manage what seems to be a lifelong depressive disorder is to accept that things are basically as they are and I do not have the capacity to change them unfortunately I do not have the strength of character or will to make meaningful longterm changes to improve myself or my conditions and opening myself up to hope of things improving or getting better always seems to be the first step towards distressing disappointment and feeling much worse. As crap as it sounds I think accepting a constant state of lowlevel misery may be better than letting myself get excited at the prospect of wins which then leads to things getting far worse when they inevitably do not pan out as hoped. Is avoiding the risk of relationships new jobs and new challenges the way to go? When medicated I can just about manage being myself. I do not think I have the capacity to handle any serious slings and arrows that come from taking risks. Football and Wider Reflections,Depression
21153,21173,Hey all...I have been struggling with depression for a few years and recently it is been making living daily life incredibly difficult. My girlfriend suggested I try medication along with therapy but I am scared and do not know what to do. I want to be able to take care of it by myself...any and all advice is appreciated. Medication?,Depression

I hate the summer too fucking heat... I want to fake a suicide to skip work i hate it.,Depression
21172,21192,I feel completely lost with things. Too many overwhelming things have happened at once and I feel like there is so much that I cannot even process it anymore. I have kept everything together for my friends and family but I just feel like everyone takes and takes from me. I have always had issues with depression and anxiety but something changed in me a few years ago when I went through a profoundly traumatic loss followed by several other lesstraumaticbutstilltraumatic losses. I did not seek out help because I was busy trying to help the people around me cope with their feelings because that literally has always been my role to anyone someone who makes things better and takes care of everyone. I still deal with the grief but more or less deal with it by crying a few times a week which really helps. Life was kind of sorting itself out in late 2019 in a relationship that seemed to be amazing work was going well I was done with graduate school and basically enjoying life other than some boredom here and there. Things really started going downhill in Feb 2020. I did not handle the shutdowns well because everything closed around me and I started getting anxious about needing dental care or something and not being able to go in. My boyfriend also started becoming super withdrawn and it was really difficult for me to not be able to help him more because I genuinely did everything I could like he told me to ease up on him and to want less and this and that I did everything he asked. A lot of our relationship died during that period but we stayed together because overall we were good and he kept saying that if I made the changes he asked and his stress went down that we could go back to being how we were in the beginning. So I did all of that. But it did not change anything. And it kills me to know that he gave infinitely more to his ex even though she was a genuinely bad person like it makes me feel like I must be just completely awful.At the same time I had a huge fight with my best friend and we did not talk for months I almost lost my main job I lost my side job it was just a really bad period of time. Things started getting a little better in fall 2020 and then throughout the spring of 2021 I felt overall better. This all pretty much drastically changed about a month ago. My boyfriend and I had a fight but instead of reconciling as normal he remained distant and remains distant. I have tried to talk to him about it so many times but he acts like I am berating him when I am not I just want to try to work things out. Around this time I started getting vertigo and weird dizziness which is really disturbing to me and which does not seem to be completely related to the anxiety as it remains even when I take Klonopin do yoga or talk myself through the anxiety. Shortly after that I tried to confide about it to my best friend and my mom but all my best friend said was you Googled too much and all my mom has to say is stuff like oh treatment will probably help but how much will it help? I feel utterly devoid of life. I am effectively housebound because of the dizziness and I get dizzy if I even go for a walk outside. I cannot do any of the stuff that I used to love doing like going to the store going outside playing video games any of it. All I have looked forward to all year was Halloween and Christmas 2021 and I was super excited that Halloween stuff was starting to come out in stores and that movie theaters were opening up two of my favorite things to entertain myself with. I can no longer participate in exploring either of these hobbies and it kills me. Like its so soulcrushing to have had these things I have used to hold onto my sanity for the past year and a half and now its..gone. I am so anxious about having to do tests and stuff to possibly find out what is causing my dizziness and what if I cannot even find a treatment for it? What if I go through the tests and it makes it worse? I feel so isolated and just completely hopeless about everything. All I can think about is how much more comforted Id be if the ones I lost a few years ago were still around. I am exhausted that I have constantly given so much of myself to others and now I just.. like beg for scraps of something back from them. I just feel like I cannot deal with any of it anymore. I cannot deal with this future of medical issues. I cannot deal with trying desperately to find support from people who really do not seem to give a shit. I am struggling with the loss of what I had with my boyfriend and with not even being able to talk it out with him to try to fix stuff. I have all of this energy that I used to give him that now has nowhere to go because he does not want it and I am tired of giving it just to have strained conversation or excuses for why he cannot love me more in return. My confidence is completely shot because I gave all of my entire soul to him and I was turned down many times for over a year now. My days and nights are consistently so lonely and I feel even more lonely now that I cannot even leave the house because I am so afraid of being dizzy and passing out or something in public. I just want to sleep forever and wish I would. I literally cannot go through even another week of this and I just want it to end. Completely tapped out and nobody to turn to anymore.,Depression
21202,21222,Exactly what the title says. How do you get out of bed every day and do your job competently enough to not be fired? I feel so stupid to have to be asking this but I seriously do not know. How do you maintain a job?,Depression
21266,21286,I feel sick for days on end because I do not eat enough and all I can do is lay in bed and listen to my stomach and smell the dirty dishes in the sink and think about how I have not washed my hair in days and feel more and more sick until I just go back to sleep to shut it all out. I do not feel sad I just feel sick and exhausted and disinterested. I used to do so much like art and guitar and hikes when I was a teenager but now my interests just sit across the room from me collecting dust. On days I work I manage to get more done unless I just end up going to bed around 7pm when I get home. But usually I will have random bursts of motivation which will allow me to do cleaning and some hygienic things. it is so embarrassing because when my boyfriend gets home he just sees me laying in bed still at 5 or 6pm and he has to go do things and I have spent the day thinking maybe I will be able to drag myself out of bed if we can just go out and do something. But of course he is usually busy and even when we go do things I always come back here and feel like I just want to sleep. He helps do chores when I do not do them but I cannot expect him to pick it all up for me. And I am sitting here thinking I need to get my shit together. How can he be attracted to someone like this. How can I show up at my parent's house looking great and convincing them my life is going so well just to go home and lay in bed again and think about how my body is only going to deteriorate more the longer I lay here. I know I will not get my shit together though. it is weird to have people call you admirable and capable just because you have a half decent job or a degree but inside you do not feel like really anything half memorable or interesting. Just because I can read into what people are saying or like to learn a lot does not really mean I am any different from anyone else and at the end of my life my interests will not actually mean anything or make a difference because we kind of just live and then die and that is it. I have health conditions that also make functioning just hard for me POTS and structural issues. Makes it hard to walk around sometimes to just get up to stay active and feel full of energy. And I do not think my emotions are too related to that it just combines into a larger hurdle for me to overcome.I dunno. I do not feel a lot. it is the fact that I do not feel a lot and when I do I sob like a child and my heart feels like it is about to explode and then I go back into this numb hungry sleep until the next time I am alive enough to feel pain again. This is rambly and borders on nonsensical but I am just saying what I am thinking. I certainly talk to some people in my life about my feelings but all that is done is made me realize I sound like a broken record and after a point they do not need to ask why I am crying or why I bailed on all of the plans because they have heard it about a million times. Breaking out of the cycle feels impossible,Depression
21272,21292,Obviously enjoyment is a struggle period but a lot of us can at least remember a time when we enjoyed our personal hobbies even if it was for a fleeting five minutes every year for years. Be it writing a song painting a picture sipping tea with a book a walk in the park at sunset with no one around meeting with friends or family whatever. But collective happinessenjoyment seems unreachable and I cannot remember a time when I could partake in it. Collective would be such as what is going on now with euro football people at work talking about it taking a day off for it meeting up at the pub to celebrate getting hyper and rowdy etc. I just think...what is the point? A few rich folk kicking a ball brings millions of people happiness even though their actions of kicking a ball is so alienated from you as an individual? This could be for anything so it is not the sporthobbyrally. Could be the world cup the Olympics basically anything that can be a collective. Does anyone feel this way or can express this better? Christmas is another collective I would always felt my depression worsening because it starts in September in the shops and basically demands a collective celebratory approach as it leads into new year where many countries blast off millions of poundsdollarseuros into the sky for five minutes of collective enjoyment when it could be spent on health or education or homelessness and I would rather celebrate christmas enjoying a day and only a day for it with good food and good company. Anybody else struggle with collective enjoyment?,Depression
21275,21295,I felt pretty bad when I sat in front of him and he told me that followed by You managed to put on makeup and brush your hair so it cannot be that bad. About a month before that I tried to kms. I was obviously unsuccessful. So unsuccessful that no one noticed but the moment still sticks with me and it is been over a year. I still think about things like that regularly.I have depression and pretty awful anxiety so on one hand I do not care but I care too much about the wrong things. You do not look like you do not care or You do not look depressed are probably the dumbest things anyone can say and it is worse to hear from a person you are supposed to trust. How many people who did not look depressed actually were and no one noticed until it was too late. I know so many people who look well put together but they have horrible stories and their outlook on life is so miserable. Many people do not look the way they felt inside because as soon as they do people either do not believe them tell them they do it for attention or are just overreacting and what not. Not caring can look many different ways and it not obvious that is the dangerous thing about it. I wish more people would understand that. My therapist told me a while ago that I do not look like I do not care,Depression
21307,21327,I am looking for antidepressants with my Real Event OCD and I want to know if anyone had any success with antidepressants for OCD. Do Antidepressants help with OCD?,Depression
21321,21341,I just cannot do this anymore I genuinely feel alone amp I know that I am not because my family amp friends are here for me but nothing works. I genuinely want to just draw in a hole amp fade away. I have no motivation anymore amp my mind is just filled with bad memories amp memories I do not want to remember anymore. I just want it to stop I want one day just one where I can be at peace. I just want to be free of this I cannot go on any longer. Overwhelmed and defeated,Depression
21333,21353,4 months ago I withdrew from medical school before they could force me out for academic failure. I am on meds have a therapist etc but its just not getting any better. I cannot go a single day without being reminded of my failure. I thought I would be doing better by now but I just feel sad Its just not getting better,Depression
21347,21367,I have not really been depressed for very long maybe 5 months or so but the happy me feels like a different person or even a vague dream. My mum came into my room today and asked where I went as in where the happy me went and I just could not answer. The state of non happiness has quickly become my norm so at this point I do not mind it its just me at this point although I am occasionally happy when I play games with friends as it distracts me from it. But my parents care for me a lot and try to help me but I do not think I can be helped at this point. I am content with the state I am in as it is just the norm. it is hard to explain sorry for the poor writing. I do not remember what its like to be happy,Depression
21353,21373,I never feel confident in myself because I take a beating as a kid after trying to defend my brother cried so hard that they start making fun of me this scars me so much that I wish I could redo it life has been always ugly for me when I was 19 I tried to achieve something really impossible that I ended up doing half of it and stoppedmotivation is gone ended up being depressed everyday and I forgot about why I go that far for someone I once loved No goal in life,Depression
21404,21424,Like you I have suffered greatly during my 28 years of existence. I am posting this because I have finally unsubscribe to this subreddit. I am sure I am going to get conflicting opinions about this but I think that this is an important thing to talk about.Since I have finally lifted myself out of depression after many years pain and suffering I find that seeing these posts in my feed make me feel sad. I do not want to feel sad anymore not that anybody does but I see that if I unsubscribe I will not have this daily dose of sadness in my life anymore.This is important to note because I think that this happens to more people than we tend to realize. Once somebody finally gets out of depression it would behoove them to distance themselves from negativity and sadness regardless of the pain and suffering of those enduring it.My point is this one of the problems with depression and why it seems to be largely ignored or exploited for monetary gain might just be that once people get out of it they stop engaging with the community because it makes them sad. It does not mean I am not going to continue to help people whenever I can because I will and I do. it is just something I have noticed that I think people might want to hear about.I wish you all the best of luck my breakthrough was getting back together with one of my childhood friends who was around when I went through most of the childhood trauma that I endured. Being with him brought me right back to when I was being molested in my basement by a mutual friend of ours. It felt like I got struck by lightning. Hanging out with my friend and engaging in playing a video game that my molester used to play with us all the time seemed to somehow get my emotions to start functioning properly again. It felt like whoever I was died in that basement at 13 years old. Like all of my emotions became stuck in time and unaccessible. My emotions are finally working again and I do not think there would have been any chance of me recovering without them back. I am not quite sure how this works but I am actively trying to duplicate my experience in those around me who are suffering. If anyone else has experienced anything like this I would greatly appreciate it if you would share your experience.I wish you all the best of luck. And I know how much it hurts. I never thought it was going to get better I was convinced I would end up offing myself before 30. I would encourage you to go and find the people that you were hanging around when you were young when the worst things in your childhood happened to you. The better they know your abuser the higher the chance if something extraordinary happening I think. Beat Depression after 28 years. cannot look at these posts anymore. amp My breakthrough moment.,Depression

21417,21437,I am always eating and throwing up or hours on the treadmill until I cannot move anymore hiding my sickness from my boyfriend is so hard sometimes but its fire season so hes gone for the next couple of months .. I feel so crippled by my self imagine I am scared that I will never feel like its enough. Its causing issues with someone I love so much because I cannot imagine he would ever want someone like me and now I have these trust issues that hes talking to other girls. He called me a nuisance yesterday when I was just looking for reassurance he cheated on me last year and I do not know if I can ever get over it. Is it supposed to hurt for this long? Crying on the treadmill,Depression
21419,21439,My whole adult life I am 52 has been a search for work and financial success I have become quite successful in my quest but these days I feel completely unfulfilled personally I love my friends and my job but feel totally empty inside All of my decisions in ther last 30 yrs have revolved around my job and its pursuits its a freelancers world the job requires extreme personal sacrifice in terms of hours worked up to 16day sometimes 7 daysweek and extensive long term travel Ill never have children as a result of this job I am getting to old my relationships are motivated and molded by the job and my sense of self worth is defined by my success professionally to change would be so drastic and leave my wonderful GF and life behind I feel so empty I just wean to stop and get off the train Not sure why I am feeling this way,Depression
21436,21456,I will start. I have been having an awful time lately and I do not know if I will be okay anytime soon but this subreddit along with a few others are helping me cope and I feel like I am not alone. I do not have anyone to talk to and it sucks but that is nothing new. How are you guys? how is everyone doing? How are you doing?,Depression
21481,21501,Analysis paralysis is real. Is anyone like this? I am already in such a dark place and this constant ruminating over the past I cannot even describe how heavy this is for me. Has anyone managed this? Or something. What ishas been your experience with ruminating? It leaves me paralyzed and panicking I do not know I wish it would all stop. Its like time travel would be the only way to fix this. I cannot stop ruminating,Depression
21490,21510,The pandemic has completely destroyed my will to live. I have lost interest in everything that I used to like and now actively hate a lot of them. I moved to a new city and have no friends. I have not seen anyone other than my parents in 16 months. I do not have any close friends who I can talk about my feelings to. I have a terrible relationship with my parents. They do not care that I am sad. I tried telling them about my feelings I cried to them. My mom brushed them off and my dad threatened to beat me up in front of all my classmates. I feel left out of everything. My friends are making plans hanging out playing games. I am here struggling through a mountain of workload and suffocating. Toiling through 10 hrs of online classes everyday trying to keep my sanity safe. Everyone I have talked to reacts negatively whenever i try to talk about my feelings. My closest friend accused me of using them after I confessed to them that I am suicidal. I have no motivation to do or learn anything. There is no interest for anything left in me anymore. Everyone tells me that I am to blame for my problems. No one knows what I am going through. No one cares. My friends tell me that I have become bitter. I hate myself so much. I just want to die somehow. I do not want to kill myself. I am too scared to. Thousands of people die everyday why cannot I be one of them? I feel so lonely. A lot of times I have dreams where I meet and hang out with people I love. I am so happy in them. Then I wake up and I am hit with reality that I will not ever be able to meet them again. I hate being alone.I do not think I have depression. I just wanted to post this somewhere because no fucking person is willing to listen and I am so sick of it. I hate it so much. I will get judged hard if I ever tell my feelings to anyone. it is ok if no one can help. I just wanted to speak out. I do not know what is happening. I just want to talk.,Depression
21503,21523,All of my friends are rapidly progressing further in life than I probably ever will truth be told. Some are looking into buying houses most have great highpaying jobs and I am still working at this bullshit ass job making 12 an hour yes I get paid less than a WalMart employee because I could not find anything after college other than bullshit sales jobs customer service or fast food jobs. I neurotically fixed my resume I do not know how many times and finally had to settle on this job which is essentially a cattle job where they simply hire warm bodies. I might be one of the few in my department with a degree. Relationships? Fucking forget it. Why would a girl want to be with a loser like myself? I have never had one because I am too socially awkward to even make eye contact anyone really not just women still work at this bullshit ass job after college making no money I have no passions hobbies nothing to offer at all. I thought this would have all just magically disappeared as I got older but I am even more pathetic than what I was when I was 18. Weekends are a joke. Everyone my age is having fun traveling being young and mine typically consist of me drinking solo browsing the internet arguing with my mom about money or some other useless bullshit and maybe playing some bullshit video game. All of my friends are moving ahead doing great things and I cannot even get some dipshit recruiter to look at my resume. And lastly fuck the holidays sideways. it is just my mom dad and I they have been divorced since I was in grade school. Truth be told it is depressing and miserable. My mom's relatives have never made the attempt to give a shit about us cannot remember the last time I actually saw any of them or much less talked to them over the phone. Sure they live across the country but the last time we saw them was in 2008 and they have never kept in contact with us since or vice versa. All of my grandparents are dead. My mom is typically depressed during the holidays and misses her family etc so she is never a lot of fun to be around which is understandable. My dad does not seem to give a shit about the holidays either way at this point. I see my dad's side from to time but it is typically just my aunt andor uncle. it is just recently dawned on me knowing I will never experience those big warm happy family dinners and laughing having fun whatever else. Just fuck everything at this point. Honestly cannot remember the last time I genuinely laughed and had fun.,Depression
21559,21579,My mom is such a sweet woman and I love her but I get frustrated over the dumbest things and I always feel like there is a wall between us and I do not know what it is I am just not on her wavelength or whatever. I fucking hate this I hate myself she deserves better than me. Every conversation with my mom ends up with me getting mad at her and apologising. I hate myself for it.,Depression
21567,21587,Stuck in my own head recently so I just think and I think and I think. Just end up talking to myself about myself for hours days even. One of the thoughts I had tonight was a theory about why I feel the need to do certain things.I have struggled with certain addictions in the past. I put that in quotes because I do not know if some of them wereare actual addictions or if I have just been conditioned to think that in before some days something about the first step is admitting it blah blah blah I get it this is probably what an actual addict would claim. My self harming I would say was probably an addiction from what I can tell. My alcoholism on the other hand I do not know if that was an addiction. The only real friend I have ever had was the one who encouraged me to stop drinking after she found out about my suicide attempt where I drank a full bottle of bourbon cut myself all up my arm and took a box of sleeping pills. I never meant to tell her but she heard about it it the next day through some crazy circumstances long story and we talked about it a little bit and she told me she wanted me to stop drinking for good reason obviously. But that is why I am not sure if Id say I was addicted to alcohol I did drink a fair bit and this was not the first night Id polished off a whole bottle by myself but I think the main reason I view it as a possible addiction is because she asked me to stop. But most of the time its pretty easy to not drink.But anyway all that aside I am starting to notice that my addictions or whatever you want to call them hard the hardest to resist when I am thinking about having these kind of movie moments. Its kind of hard to explain but its like I just think about the emotional state I am in or some event that is triggered me and I sometimes picture myself in a sort of movie scene something Id imagine you would see if a main character went through what I just did and its the scene that shows them processing that or whatever. An example would be in the show Lucifer when Lucifer is sitting on the beach smoking with his wings on the ground behind him. Or any time BoJack goes on a bender in BoJack Horseman scenes like that. Its like the only way I know how to process my emotions is by creating one of these moments for myself in real life. I have to put on some music and sit on a beach at night with a glass of whiskey in my hand or go to a club and get lost in a drugfuelled montage or stand on the roof of a high rise in the middle of the city and smoke. I do not know why this is.But the urge to create these moments for myself is the main thing that pushes me to want to drink or smoke or do drugs or selfharm. There are just some settings or some feeling that feel wrong without the accompanying vice. Even things like the type of alcohol changes sometimes a straight glass of whiskey neat. Sometimes its beer. Sometimes its vodka straight from the bottle. Other times its cocktails. I do not have a preference of my own only what fits the moment I feel like I need to have.I do not know why I do this. I have thought maybe its because I want people to see me a certain way and maybe it is to some extent but almost every time I do it I am alone. Although I guess in the movies they always start alone and sometimes somebody will walk up to them. I do not know what to do with this information I do not know if its better for me to ignore these urges to create the Hollywood moments even though sometimes they actually make me feel a little better and nothing else helps with that or if I should give into them when they happen take it as a sign that I need to process and allow myself to break my sober streak. Hell I do not even know why I have still got a sober streak the only people that cared about me getting clean are gone now. Guess its just force of habit at this point. Anyways do not know why I decided to post about this but its something I noticed and thought was weird. A theory about why I get some of the impulses I get,Depression
21569,21589,I recently read about North korea defects and its human rights violations and it made me feel hopeless. I know there is evil in the world but nothing has changed and I do not think it ever will. Vent,Depression
21575,21595,Being at home with my family is like fighting massive fires on my rare days off. I love them but they are going to destroy my physical and mental health I swear. Sis waking me up earlier than I need on my ONE day off so that I can go out with her and then leaving before I am ready...She just called me. she is going far. The conversation goes Do you still want to come out. I am thinking a long walk down to the river or something so I say yes. See you in part of town I hate going to then.it is been ten minutes since she left and she thinks I am angry because I have not texted her yet. I say no I am in the bog I have IBS that are not going away any time soon with this stress and that I just woke up.She scorns me saying well I stayed up with dad last night she does not talk to him so I guess I should not either?. I am on the verge of telling her to fuck off but I do not.When I go silent she makes another snide remark. I tell her I am just trying to figure out how to get there although actually I am trying to decide if I should allow her to manipulate me into this or not. She tells me to take the bus.it is free for her. it is expensive for me.Why is her depression making her selfish shortsighted and a bitch to me? Is this common? Does depression make people cruel to their loved ones,Depression
21581,21601,I thought I was getting better but now that I think about it I just got used to living like this. No passion for anything no pleasure from anything.I feel like a being that is just there occupying space I got used to it,Depression
21595,21615,So this happened some years ago. When I was about 5 we had a small doggy may be less than 7 months old. Well she got sick and me being just a kid did not have much saying on what needs to be done and it was my first experience with a sick animal so I did not even know what to do I was scared and did not want to lose her. Just thought grownups will make everything right.She did not make it as fever reached her brain back then I did not know what that means. Now 14 years later I have been remembering her for a little over a month. How I could have saved her if I nagged my parents even more might have admitted her to a better vet hospital. She could have been with us now.Idk I kind of want to end stuff I could not save her. She was just a pup. Been crying since a month,Depression
21605,21625,I feel extremely lonely. I drove the only person I love and who treated me kindly and always was there for me away forever. The one time I find love I find it hard to love. she is convinced I am bpd but everytime I asked for help i just feel like I am being ignored and brushed off. I lost my job two months ago because of performance issues from lack of energy and my alcoholism. My mood swings are driving me insane. I can never feel happiness just emptiness which fuels my drinking even more even tho I know I need to stop. Just turned 23 last month and spent it in bed and with my ex leaving me and telling me its over for ever. We were engaged and planning on having kids in a year. I dk what to do the doctors just give you meds and that is it. I am truely lost and never thought Id make a post like this ever. I feel like I am at the end of the road. Its been a constant cycle since my teens. I can never find peace. And to make it worst I felt like I was going to die around 23. Sorry for rambling I just do not know what to do. Everything has gone wrong my life constantly. I just want to be normal. Lost with no hope,Depression
21657,21677,My head is so foggy. I stare into nothingness and I cannot keep a conversation going because it feels like my head is working really slow. I have no energy or motivation or positive thoughts. I feel like I have just wasted my whole life. I never feel like antidepressants helped me and I will never ever take them again. They were hell for me. They just kind of made me stop caring. And feeling things. But not solve my problems.I just feel so tired all the time and just stay inside most of the time. I do not know where my life is headed at all. I am getting a psychologist to talk to soon but I have no positive thoughts about it. it is hard for me to open up and most of the time I just stay quiet and do not really know what to say and my brain feels so foggy and I cannot focus at all and it is like this all the time and been like this my whole life almost. I feel like I am in this weird state where I feel like I am just there but not really there. Like a weird dream state. Detached from everything and feeling so weird and different. Quit antidepressants 3 months ago and I do not know how to deal with real life again. Is it withdrawals or a really bad depression coming back?,Depression
21660,21680,I do not know why. I feel terrible all the time and instead of opening up to friends or family I am rude and push them away. I think I just ended a friendship and it all feels so involuntary. I do not know how to control it anymore. When anyone becomes close at all I panic and just sink away and feel like I am drowning and I am sinking deeper and deeper into the suck. It feels like a leech sucking me dry. I cannot think clearly like I could before I just have a fog and think about dying constantly. I do not know that I want to die but sometimes like I am tied to a railroad track and the train is coming. I just want to enjoy things and feel like a functional person. I think that I might be emotionally draining if I talk with friends or family. I want to feel better Why,Depression
21666,21686,I have always struggled with depression. Started freshman year of high school 2010 and its been getting worse ever since. Some months are perfecting fine but when a wave of it would hit and I am crying myself to sleep or just staring at my phone. 11 years of this and the only reason I am still going is because of my dog. Only a few more years....I saw a it is get better post on Facebook when I was in high school. This women made a post talking about how she struggled in high school but now she is 25 and happy with a family. Well I am 26 and I have no family. Just my dog. Originally thought it was my best friend and her family but after living them with 2 years I realized I am at the bottom of the totem pole. If everyone is the problem maybe it is you. I have had friends but none tend to stay long. If I am not going to school or working with my friends then they are not my friends. For whatever reason when I leave a place those friends do not want to hang out anymore. Graduated High school? Those friends I do not talk to though I see them post all the time on Snapchat together My friends at my pervious job I now long talk to. again see them post on snap together. I am going to be leaving my current job in a few weeks and I know it will be rinse and repeat. Again... is it me?I just want to know when it does get better? Because I do not know how much longer I have in me. When does it get better?,Depression
21683,21703,just realized tonight that I am so desperate for validation that it makes me feel helpless... i just want someone to See me and acknowledge me and recognize that I am here and that I am struggling even though my issues are not as big as other peoples... i want it so badly i cannot even begin to describe what i want... i thought i just wanted attention but actual attention makes me feel exposed and raw like my skins gone and i thought attention from a therapist would help but it just feels like its not scratching the right itch... it feels like my brain wants me to make up for 20 years of being ignored and pushed to the sidelines because i was too quiet and anxious and probably autistic to have any adults or teachers pay attention to me desperate for validation,Depression
21685,21705,My step brother contestantly kicks me In the face and slaps me but when I barely poke him with a flashlight to retaliate he calls me a bitch baby even though he is acting like a 3 yr old. It makes me depressed that no one agrees he needs with me about him needing to grow a pair and be made a man but I am called a bitch when I barely mess with him which usually results in me getting physically harmed by him what do I do. Tldr getting harassed and physically hurt by stepbrother and what do I do? Btw he tells me occasionally how I am ugly and no one loves me which does not help me mentally I am pissed,Depression
21733,21753,I just really feel like everything I do something wrong happens. And its not something that I can overlook or hope I can push through it. Its always something that completely stomps me from doing anything until the issue is resolved no matter how time consuming or stressful. I am really tired of living like this Life,Depression
21739,21759,Everyone wants to be special but nobody can be. we are all fucked dragged in a giant rat race a mess we made for ourselves but everyone still wants to be better than the next person their lives are special to them even though we are just another dumb animal species in just one planet one single blue dot in the vastity of the universe. But I am special. I have got to be special. And everyone else does too. Nobody wants to be a nobody. Nobody wants to be a nobody,Depression
21777,21797,He hides it from his friends whom he plays games etc with should I tell one of his friends so that they may help? I have tried everything and I will keep trying but I wanted to ask if that is okay in this scenario? My bf is depressed as he is jobless.,Depression
21786,21806, Hey my friend has been struggling with a lot of problems and is going into depression and I am not too sure how to help usually we meet up and they talk and I just listen but I want to do more than that. What are some things I can say do that would help them or things I should not saydo? serious I need help helping my friend,Depression
21791,21811,Hello! I am looking for support or just anyone who is kind enough to read through this post and I really wanted to share about my struggles with depression and get of out this really dark place that I am in right now. I believe that I may have highfunctioning depression although I do want to diagnose myself everything looks fine on the outside and I seem to be doing well but I am really struggling on the inside. I feel really lonely unloved unappreciated and most of all empty and hallow. I feel like an empty she will of a person who has no sense of self and has no interestshobbiespassions about anything in life. Everyday is the same boring monotony and I do not feel motivated or have the energy to change my routine because I am so unhappy with the way my life has turned out and the people around me. I had a relatively good and happy childhood however things started to get worse as I became a teenager. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was in middle school I come from an immigrant family with very conservative values and I never able to get the help that I needed for it. I struggled a lot in school and had poor grades which I think caused me to spiral into a deep depressionanxiety. I have been struggling since I was 1213 and I am now 24. I have also suffered a lot of abuse at the hands of my family members and the trauma has completely shattered my selfesteem and selfworth which further made the depressionanxiety I was experiencing exponentially worse. I definitely think my toxic upbringingenvironment and not getting help for my ADD made things worse for my mental health. I now work at a Fortune 100 tech company and I constantly feel unworthy and that I do not deserve this amazing opportunity. I do not have the confidence and upbeat personality all of my coworkers seem to have. I have no support system no friends no relatives except my immediate family. I am surrounded by my coworkers who are all in relationships have a solid friend group relatives etc. they are surrounded by all of the love and support in the world while I feel like I have wasted my life due to my unfortunate situation and years of trauma and depression. I feel like the people around me are so much luckier they had it easier and I know they will go far in life and their careers. I cry every night because I am so terrified of my future I have no friends at all and feel like no one cares about me. Dying of loneliness. I want to move out and live on my own but I am scared and the depression has been making it hard to find the motivation to get things done. Most importantly I want to stay away from the toxic and negative people in my life. I do not want to feel like there is no hope in my life no bright future for me. I do not want the people or the circumstances in my life to define me or break me down. I know I deserved better! How can someone who has no interests or hobbies and is very depressed such as myself connect with other people and make friends? I would like to make longterm meaningful friends not just acquaintances or superficial connections. Thank you for reading my post all the way through! Looking for support,Depression
21794,21814,reddit is a rabbit hole. come here after thinking your depression has gone and help people. up to you trap,Depression
21811,21831,People tend to say my view on the world is pretty negative while I just think I see it as it is. I have a very distinct and active sense for for sure just my point of view justice. I think humanity overall has no interest in creating justice for everybody. The people who are rich get richer and the poor countries get exploited as far as possible. Humans tend to hate others for being themselves and liking what they like. And I can never stop being that dumb social justice warrior in my head. I get the feeling that I ruin the atmosphere when people make sexist or racist jokes and I tell them that it is critical what they said because what we mean and say often are different things. I also study something where I am confronted with this kind of stuff everyday. I like it because the people who study with me are also more of social justice warriors who want to talk about the effect of what we say rather than thinking I am a killjoy. My problem is I do not want to be like that. I just feel so responsible that the people who get discriminated feel better that the people stop saying dumb shit that really hurts the people and how others look at them. I just want my head to stop thinking everytime well that was pretty discriminating against whoever. I just want people to be sensitive towards the feeling of others and listen to each other. I also listen to those people and try to tell them why I think it is critical to say it. I do not want to be entitled but I want to go into a dialogue. I am always political and on a high level of society view and cannot get rid of it for a few hours to chill. I hate it. And the most ironic part I hate having trouble or arguments where people feel attacked by me. Discussion yes but not on a personal base like you are a bad person. But often the people think I want to criticise them and their point of view.I am sorry this was more of a rant but especially when I am longer time on reddit I get those struggles. I do not want the people to have the same opinion but it is just so much hate often in here where the people do not even try to understand what the other person wanted to say. Thanks for reading. Hope anyone can relate and I am not just a big asshole that seems like I want to tell all of you what kind of a good person I am. I really think it sucks and I seem unfun. I kind of hope that this ongoing feeling that it is kind of my responsibility goes away whenif depression gets better... Maybe I am just holding on to that in my head so I feel like I have at least a moral I can follow and do not go insane and more lost than I already am. I cannot shut my mouth when i see something I think is unfair or unrealistic,Depression

21838,21858,I constantly repeat to myself that I have never really been given a fighting chance. Quite honestly all the odds are against me and I have spent so long fighting and I am just tired. I grew up with abusive parents I am mixed so my mom is a stereotypical Chinese mom. She was brutal in ways a lot of daughters of immigrant parents can relate to physically mentally emotionally. She challenged me a lot academically I started playing piano when I was 3 I was in advanced tutoring ballet I never really got a chance to be a kid. My dad on the other hand is something else hes significantly older than my mom. He had a failed marriage and I was raised along my half sisters I watched them get treated awfully by him until their mom took them away. That caused me to have a lot of abandonment issues. My dad is not a good person. Hes very religious and abuses it. He raised me teaching me I am an object to fulfill male desire and pleasure and to create children. I was taught about purity and how my destiny is to make my husband happy save my body for him and create children. These teachings began when I was old enough to comprehend and continue even now. Its traumatizing and this has caused me to develop sexual triggers concerning my anxiety and OCD diagnoses. Its made iy impossible for me to have healthy relationships or have sex. I feel like my body and my heart are broken. It does not help that he sexualized me significantly while also teaching me to hate my body. It confused me. he would hit me a lot but he would do it while saying he loved me. I am just really confused. I was under a lot of pressure in every area my parents are successful business people they trained me to adhere to productivity culture. they would always tell me I am on my own and need to learn to work. When I was 10 I got severely ill. Auto immune disease. It was very severe and I was practically living in hospitals until I was 14. I could not go to school I lost the majority of my friends. I had tried extreme diets chemotherapy steroids I had a feeding type for two years and ultimately had a surgery to remove an organ. During the times I was really sick the abuse and mistreatment would stop and as sick as it sounds Id almost be thankful for being unwell so I would not be hurt so badly. My illness made me so mad though. Ever since I was 8 Id tell myself every day 10 more years you can run away you will be out of here you will be independent just make it to 18 my illness resulted in a physical disability and since its autoimmune I live with the fear iy could come back at any time now I am forever dependent on my parents for money and health insurance and I can never be free from them. I am so angry about this all I ever wanted was to be free and that caused me to not be. I am interested in psychology I read a lot of research surrounding trauma and I know very well that my illness could be a direct because of the abuse. I guess my soul just could not take it I feel weak. Every time Id get better the abuse would begin again. we have had cps visits lots of people are concerned. My parents made up a lie I have autism so when teachers or health care providers are worried about how anxious I am amongst other signs of abuse they have something to cover it up with. They say they have always suspected me to have autism they try to convince me to fake certain traits when they take me in for testing. I know better and I know what its all about. I feel like a lot of people failed me. Eventually when I got smart enough to get help on my own my parents told me of how my illness can come at any time and if I were to leave and go to foster care they would not be able to help me get the best medical care. And at times I need constant medical care. A really difficult situation as you can see. Before I could tell myself 18 and I am gone and all of a sudden I did not even know if that is possible anymore. Eventually I got better do go surgery and I was able to be fully normal again I went back to school made a lot of friends and developed a plan to become financially stable by the time I am 18. I was not allowed to go out hardly ever while I was sick I could never leave home and they would punish me in ways such as taking away electronics wifi books etc. so Id be forced to be in a room with no distractions at all. I knew these punishments could come back so I had to think smart. I began building a persona and platform online through different social media platforms. I marketed myself as a teen creator photography fashion etc. like an influencer basically. More than anything I value my privacy and I know how sad my life is so I hated portraying a happy teenager online I never wanted to be influencer I just wanted a platform so when the time came I could use it to create a business. Over time I built a big platform I was featured in publications I had brand deals I was even invited to prestigious events. This did not result in much money just experience. you would think Id be proud of my accomplishments but I am not at all. I regret it more than anything I hated being a 15 year old essentially selling myself like a product online. Getting myself into situations and events filled with adults. I feel embarrassed for all the danger I put myself in online. I wish I could have still been able to be a kid. I kept pushing and pushing myself my new endeavor was writing a book about my experiences as a teen influencer and my illness and such. I should not have done this. I spent a year doing this it was essentially shadow work. By the end of it I realized how sad my life was how all of this was not the result of passion or ambition just a desperate attempt of freedom. As a teenager I was never allowed to drive. I am turning 18 in a few days I still cannot drive. I cannot go anywhere without permission if I try to leave my house my parents call the cops on me which incites a panic attack. They know this and claim my panic attacks are of a mentally unstable person needing to go to a psyche ward. Everyone I know tells me I remind them of Britney Spears its sad. When covid quarantine was announced it was the worst day of my life. No one understood why I was freaking out so much they did not realize that all my life I had been subject to extreme lockdowns. Not being able to leave my house being stuck with them I knew what it was like to never leave the house a house filled with so much awfulness. It was happening again. I had already realized how I wanted to step away from my online platform after realizing the real reason I did all of this. My parents are high risk as well as me so they went extreme for quarantine. Since March 2020 up until may 2021 I was being held captive in my home. We had security systems set with a password only my mom knew I could never leave. If I left my room I risk having a panic attack or being yelled at ao I stayed in my room for almost a year with no other human contact. all I had was social media this is awful for mental health and I am now left with severe depression anxiety and ocd. I had a boyfriend at the time he was my first love my everything really. We started dating a year before lockdown we only got serious a few months prior though. To say he was a miracle in my life is an understatement. Before him I did not even know what love was or how I deserved to be treated I had no idea what normal human kind interactions of love were I had not even been able to cry for 5 years. He opened my heart up he helped me understand all that had happened to me and how it was not my fault. He knew how much I went through and how much I was going through he put his life on hold to help me feel as comfortable as I could while I was stuck in the house. he would stay on the phone with me every day he would plan virtual movie dates he would write me letters he would stay on the phone while I napped or slept to make sure I did not have nightmares he would drop off gifts and food for me. Lockdown meant everyone working from home in my house and all food and grocerys delivered it was intense. For a year and a half. during this time my friends all grew up they are indecent now and although I still have close friends we drifted. My boyfriend was the only one who stayed by me helping me with everything. This time period caused me to decline mentally a lot I took out all my anger at him I was so mean to him Id yell at him. I have ocd and because it is triggered by my fathers teachings it can make me think I do not love my boyfriend or it can make me think he has hurt me physicallysexuallymentally etc. Id take out all my frustration on him. I was not a good girlfriend. He stayed by me though so patient never yelled never fought back he treated me with all the kindness I could have hoped to have when I was young. He knew how much I had been hurt and was still being hurt so he started working jobs to save up money to get me out once I turn 18 he contacted family to help him and help me. I felt guilty him giving up his future for me. But he really did love me he just wanted me to be happy and be there to see it. He knew about my disability and sickness he would help take care of me too. In January a lot of family issues arose tragedies and death. I started spiraling then I was overwhelmed unbelievably overwhelmed I do not know exactly what happened a depressive episode maybe manic episode I do not know. I broke up with my boyfriend out of no where. A mix of the guilt and just idk I knew it was a mistake he was the only good thing in my life and my way out of this family but I broke up with him. Its been 7 months we talk every day I want him back I tell him that but I hurt him so much I gave up on him when he never gave up on me. Its too late for anything now hes back on track with a new career plan and hes doing amazing. I am not. After I broke up with him I launched a online business reading astrological charts for people I made an insane amount of money utilizing my social platforms. It robbed me of the passion I had for my hobby with astrology though really burned me out. During quarantine to pass time I also became a certified doula. Youngest to become one from the program I trained with. I have no patience I worked day and night to create my business materials and it failed never got work except for birth fetishizers that scammed me into talking about birth with them. Sick traumatizing. This episode I had caused me to shut off emotion I was unhinged just working my ass off just like before I met my boyfriend investing all my energy into work. Then I had a wake up call realized how unhappy and miserable I am having to conform to hustle entrepreneurial ship culture just for freedom. I want to drive I want to get a job outside. I want to go to school. I do not want this I do not want this at all. I am allowed to go out now but every time I do I get panic attacks. Being in isolation for so long causes you to get overwhelm very easily. I can hardly function. My friends are all going to college now I wanted to take a gap year to heal but I still have no independence. I lost it all I lost everything or maybe I just had nothing to begin with. My birthday is in a week. I get something I call birthday blues every birthday I feel so depressed and borderline suicidal. Most of my birthdays in my childhood were traumatic it would be a peak day of abuse and such so now every birthday I just wish I was dead. This one is going to be the worse. I spent my whole life looking forward to turning 18. It was going to be the day I am free. Its not anymore. That was my only goal I told myself this every day ever single fucking day and now I am turning 18 with absolutely nothing. Nothing. I have nothing. I fought for this long and for what. For absolutely nothing. I thought last year would be my worst birthday. My then boyfriend knew I would not be allowed out even if its just outside to say hi. So he created a big surprise for me full of my favorite things and left it outside for me all I wanted to do was bring it in and get my flowers and balloons. I love flowers and balloons and I realized a new security system had been set and I was now completely trapped in the house. My dad was crowding around me he scares me a lot I have not talked to him in over a year I cannot without panicking. Hes scary. I ran to my room and sobbed all I wanted was to get my flowers and balloons. I locked myself in my room and cried all day just like every year. My boyfriend was on the phone though. he would sing to me and tell me stories to help calm me down. Hes not here anymore and no one else is either. My friends are all living their own grown up lives now. Its just me now. And I told myself for years that all I had to do was turn 18 and it would be over. Now its worse than ever. I feel hopeless I have never been happy in my life I live in isolation I feel like I am being held captive. I have lost everything. I never had anything to begin with.,Depression
21882,21902,I am in the worst place mentally that I have ever been in since I was first diagnosed with depression 6 years ago. I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I have a job and I work around 2535 hours per week but it takes up all of the energy I can possibly give and when I am not working I just sit at home and do nothing most of the time. I do not even enjoy watching tv or movies anymore. I have no motivation or energy to hang out with friends or family and I always end up cancelling plans. This is absolutely destroying all of my relationships and I hate it so much. The most basic tasks like brushing my teeth or showering feel impossible a lot of the time. I feel like a failure and I am only 19 yet I feel like my life is over. I am so depressed I cannot even watch tv anymore,Depression
21961,21981,Still 27 still feeling like shit its crazy to think about who I was before depression hit me. Ask anyone who knew me they would say I was radiant full of joy life insouciance... I lost myself completely. I do not trust myself anymore at all I doubt every decision I make so I end up not doing anything anymore. I have a tendency to shut people off and I have noticed no matter how social I could be before covid to make it up like during weekends party like nothing mattered but after time people stop reaching out. And I never reach out because I am ashamed. I feel like shit every day that passes is worst on my self estime.I am not ugly I am not dumb but I was raised in a very abusive household and never developped sence of identity. I never been in a successful relationship it was always I chasing the wrong guys or the wrong guys chasing me. Never said I love you to someone even though I felt it never had the guts did not even matter he played with me anyway.I never had any recognition from my parents family and now I have no friends anymore. Nothing but a cat.I tell myself everyday to go work out to have a self of worth at least for something in the day because I am tired of switching through the same 3 apps all day. I am just tired and hopeless for the future for my future. I get uglier day by day and lose confidence as I stay alone and lonely but at the same time i cannot reach out to people. Most have lost interest and live their best life and it will only hurt my self estime more to be rejected again. I cannot take any more rejection. But at the same time I do not let anyone in anymore. I am at the age were people do not care anymore. I feel like I am waiting for my mom to pass away to take away my own life because she is the only human being that gave me just a little bit of love of course with a lot of manipulation and hurt too. I just have an outlook on life that is so different now. Life is just not as cool and fun as it used to be. I sometimes cannot point out if its a mid or depression and growing up but deep down I know its mostly depression.I went to psychiatrist but I do not even feel like it anymore. I know what is wrong with me but I cannot fix it. I feel like I have been alone for so long now that I cannot get back. And tonight there is a free amazing party next to my place where I hear all the music and people shooting and it reminds me of the time I did that. I did not have to think twice I would always have plans on weekends.Now I have sports my cat Netflix and my memories.I want to be part of the 27 club more and more. Let my writing be heard I cannot take it anymore I have had nothing but bad luck all my life and I beg for it to be over. It will never be as good as it was. Let me go away and let people be happy because I cannot Need to vent a bit again,Depression
21983,22003,I feel horrible I have cut contact from friends and have not called back. I just do not have the energy to do this I cannot explain it. How do I tell them Its not personal? Its my own battles taking over my brain not allowing me to function normally No motivation to reply back,Depression
21996,22016,I finally got a job after being basically jobless for 2 years. All I do is load a machine and push a button and let it do its thing all day every day. Then I come home and do nothing because I have no passions or interests. The only thing that makes me happy is smoking pot. I have been tired for all of my Saturday and have basically been in bed all day. For what? So I can go back to work next week be miserable and hate my life and do it again. Even if I had hobbies I doubt id ever be able to actually afford them. I am going no where and will live with my parents and be a failure until the day I am dead. I feel like my existence is completely and utterly useless.,Depression
22025,22045,After graduating from college in 2019 and being somewhat unemployed for the past 2 years I feel I have forgotten majority of people I knew and I also feel like there are no new people that have been introduced in my life to fill that gap. This loneliness aches. I hope I find love soon and know what it feels like being alive. After each passing year I am losing more and more people that I knew.,Depression
22031,22051,I am trying to fight this and not lie in bed all day. Today I went kayaking for an hour and went swimming. Then after 3 hours I went back home. I am in a new city alone not the reason for my depression looking for a new start rather. Now its 416 on a Saturday and I have no idea what to do in Pittsburgh to occupy so much time. I have to fight an urge to lie around and smoke weed all day What to do with 16 long hours?,Depression
22053,22073,I am a lesbian 31F who has been desperately longing to have a girlfriend ever since puberty but I was a shy and chubby teenager and had many unrequited crushes on straight girls. In my late teensearly 20s I did try to meet other queer women near me mainly through online dating but that led to few dates and no relationships and it all made me very uncomfortable anyway because of my social anxiety. The queer dating pool is small anyway and I am also a screw up in general depressed college dropout living with relatives and working a dead end job who will probably never amount to anything so it is not like women would be breaking down the door to date me anyway. Still I find myself longing for love and sex and it breaks my heart to see almost everyone I know datingmarried. How can I move on from this obsession and accept it will probably never happen? How to make peace with it? And please no responses like just go out there and try! or do not give up! I am trying to be realistic and specifically asking for help to accept what is probably inevitable. How to accept I will probably never have lovesex?,Depression
22068,22088,will i ever be noticed? is my life worth anything? i spend all day doing nothing full of sorrow and pain while wishing pain on others. i waste my time day after day after day slowly killing myself mentally. the isolation is killing me. i have no one to talk to about it it feels like I am going to hurt myself or someone else but I am too afraid to act on it solely because i do not want to go back to the mental hospital. who am i? why am i here? what is my point anymore? i do not want to waste away like this i work so hard to get better my days always start off promising but go to shit quickly. it feels like life itself is playing me like a fiddle why though? what did i do to deserve this pain? I have been like this since i was a mere toddler so why me? did i commit a major sin in my past life? was there a past life? i do not know anymore. i wanted to grow up to help people to be a leader to change peoples lives for the better but now i will not be anything. at most ill be homeless at worst ill be dead but is it really that bad? is it bad to lose my life anymore? nobody would miss me. i destroyed all of my relationships. i only have my mother i love my mother she is been through so much she is so strong and I am so proud of her but i do not think i want to continue to live like this. i just want to escape i cannot embrace this life anymore for it has brought me to my knees. nobody would miss me. i do not care anymore. i will not even miss myself. I am just too afraid to go through with it i do not have a gun i do not have anything of that sort so what do i do? i do not feel like a human. i feel subhuman i feel like nothing why was i born this way WHY? WHAT THE FUCK DID I DO? I DID NOTHING. I JUST WANTED A NICE AND SAFE JOURNEY BUT OF COURSE I HAD TO GO INSANE FROM ISOLATION. this is not even mentioning all of the voices and stuff i see its probably due to loneliness i hear people calling my name a comforting girls voice a girl i do not even know a girl i will never know. right before i sleep i am haunted with the noises of people saying my name as if I am at my deathbed. i know it is unrealistic though. because no one would miss me in reality. I am a nobody i do nothing to help other people I have been a mental cripple my entire life. its only become apparent recently when all of my friendships came falling down solely because i am a horrible friend and horrible narcissistic degenerate of a person in general. this is not even the worst I have felt last night was when i cried harder than I have ever cried i had to cover my mouth to prevent screaming i do not want my mom to worry about me. my mom deserves everything for how hard she works for me even after my dad died. i know my dad would be sad if i go through with killing myself but hes not here anymore hes in a better place. i know that my life is going to get worse from here my teenage years have just started and it feels like i am really losing my mind. do i deserve this? is this because of all my past mistakes? i do not know and i will not ever know. what hurts most is that everyone i know would tell me how much i change that i was not the same funny happy helpful me. that is what my friend told me right before we stopped talking. I am such a selfish fucking bitch. i always talk about other people not being empathetic but i myself am not empathetic and only paint myself to be so other people feel bad am i really just this bad of a person? is all I am looking for a reaction from everyone so that i can finally know they care or make them care? i do not know. i do not know answers to any of this. i feel like I am going insane with all these thoughts flowing around my head there is nothing that calms them anymore i am just filled with negative emotions and i have no way to control them. i know i will never be off meds. last time i was i was crying harder than i have ever cried and i had the worst homicidal thoughts. at this point its a struggle to keep myself from hurting myself and others. i bet it would be a lot better for everyone if i was gone nobody would be hurt. thank you if you read this whole thing. accumulation of my thoughts.,Depression
22096,22116,i do not need advice it will not help. my life has been horrible since i was a young my father died and my mother was abusive my entire life growing up i just want to die without feeling pain as I am very afraid of pain from my past of being abused will someone please tell me how to kill myself without feeling pain for long i just want to rest please. i have no friends i spend my entire days watching tv shows and playing games to try and detach myself from the real world anytime i stop doing that all i can think of is how much i hate myself and living everything is lonely and it hurts. someone please just tell me how to leave I am tired of everyone telling me to stay and that things get better when all they have done is get progressively worse the past 16 years i wish i knew a painless way to kill myself,Depression
22112,22132,It feels awful seeing all the people my age having the best times with friends doing stuff meanwhile i live in the middle of nowhere abusive bigotted alcoholic parents that never teached me any social skills so I am socially awkward lonely as hell i just want a good friend but i cannot make one I am gay but i cannot come out it feels like prison i do not have the strength to keep in touch with people i do not have motivation to do anything i do not want to work a job i hate capitalism i want to do music because it is become my only escape.

22150,22170,TLDR i tend to isolate and push people around when i got depressed. i want to change that behaviour so i do not because problem anymore. The final straw is when my academic manager in college say to me that she hate the type of student of me. When i get down i tend to isolate myself. Always hesitant wether i should reach out and bothering people or just suck it up because i am worthless anyway. This kind of behaviour because me a lot of troubles and enemys. I done this to my seniors friends classmate bestfriend even family. There is the time that my classmates drive me into corner and ask what do i want because clearly i am in deep trouble and i am dragging them down. But i do not know anything. I do not know what i truly want. Some help? More time? Encouragement? Motivation? Some space? Or what. This drive them crazy and at the same time make me even more crazy than them that i am bothering them for nothing. that is why i am hesitant to ask help or report or just to tell someone. And they tend to avoid me as well. To put it simply They want to help but i do not know about what because the problem for me so i cannot say anything. Sometimes my brain is in fog other time i complete clueless. So i want to change this behaviour. But i do not know a thing about it. How it happen? Why? What because it? When limitation factors around it anythings. Can someone tell me about it please i want to change. How to change to not be an asshole?,Depression
22151,22171,I do not think I have been truly happy in my life even once in its entirety. I have just floated along for over twenty years just a husk of a person. So I have to ask what exactly is happiness? What is happiness?,Depression

22166,22186,Mentally and physically. Honestly I am so tired. I went to the dentist to have my tooth extracted then found out that a lot of my teeth are in trouble. I have spent a lot of money already and were still not done. I have not gotten my period for 3 months now so I am going to need to see a gynecologist. I am going to start therapy soon and I am worried that its going to cost a lot of money. Sometimes I feel proud that I am taking care of myself but when I think about the expenses aaaahhh never mind. I have a lot of defects,Depression
22176,22196,I hate when people come around my house or call me I just want to be alone. I was having a good day but some one who makes me feel anxious came around and my mum keeps shouting at me for not going to talk to them.i feel really rude as well but i just cannot bring myself to go downstairs. i only want to talk with my school friends and I cannot wait to either kill myself or leave this house. I want to be left alone,Depression
22178,22198,I am a 27 year old guy short ugly zero friends really nothing going for me. I mostly spend almost all my time browsing 4chan or playing video games. I both enjoy the company I get from the people I interact with online and hate it because at the end of the day every person I come in contact with is a meaningless anonymous figure. I feel like I am addicted to spending my time this way because if I did not I would just spend it completely alone. It would be easy to say go out and do something but I have zero friends and live in the middle of nowhere. Even if there was I have a very hard time socializing. I do not have the confidence to post myself on dating sites or anything like that. What is there left to turn to? I feel like the internet is ruining my life but at the same time I have nothing else.,Depression
22207,22227,I am a m 36 and there is only one thing I constantly think about. And that is leaving this place. I have had insomnia for longer then I can remember I am the oldest of 5 and all of my younger siblings are married with children. Every tree I see I want to hang from it. Every pillar I see I want to take my seatbelts off and full throttle ram it. Seems like the opposite sex only likes to use me. I was ok with it at first because it was the only affection I ever got. Now I am just done with everything and everyone. I do not think I will make it to 40 do not want to either.,Depression
22283,22303,Just a little about me before you read this Hi I am Noah. I am 15 years old and I live in a small place outside of a city called Manchester in the NorthWest of England.I seem to get these depressive 'episodes' where I tend to feel like crap for weeks at a time but I then get a small burst of happiness for about a week solid where I feel like I can actually stand the problems I am facing in life. I am currently not feeling too bad right now and I have not been feeling awful for the past 2 days but I am just waiting for my mood to completely drop sometime soon. Is this normal...? Depressive episodes.,Depression
22288,22308,And that i will not have a good life that ill alway regret thing's that i did not do or committed to.It feel like I am my greatest weakness and i cannot do anything i do not commit I am lazy and when i had phone counselling i alway felt negative before feeling like I am just there just to feel like I am helping myself but I am not.I could get therapy session but i feel like it is pointless.This make me empty alone and that I am too far gone that my life is over it feel like i have so many problems yet it feel like i do not have any or that they are too small.These past couple of days are just me escaping and ignoring my problem. I feel i will not see an happy ending to life,Depression
22295,22315,Suicidal thoughts in my head do not know how to let go. Lost in my head as time flies by with no one at my side. Stress eating away at my bones. Mind slowly decaying in the madness. I am to far from the shore Now do not know if Ill ever get back. Sacred that I am losing this battle with myself. everyone is gone now. Empty on the inside nothing but a black hole. do not know if Ill ever feel something real. life is pointless. what is the point of this pain and suffering. I just Smoke the pain away every night but still left with these thoughts of suicide and knowing death is the end of everything no pain no sadness just peace. I am so alone I do not know how much longer I can go on like this. i want to break my hand sometimes or crash my car just to feel something. I wished I would have died on that highway last year but I guess I am still here who knows for how long. Suicidal thoughts,Depression

22369,22389,I have tried to reach out for help over small things over the years. I have tried in person I have tried the government I have tried my parents . I started trying to reach out on Instagram but always delete it for fear or seeming annoying. My boyfriend suggested I try Reddit because he gets a lot of support from the app but anytime I use it I get negative comments. I deleted my last account because people would make fun of me. I am trying really hard to become a better person and want to become independent. I am starting to loose hope and doubt that Ill ever have my shit together . I give up,Depression
22384,22404,gtPerpetual existence sorrows that forever repeat cycles that collapse a person. gt gtIndelible memories turned into still images constantly being reproduced. gt gtMirror of the past reflects good times now buried in misery. gt gtInevitable roads which intersect with life and divert our course.Free poetry helps me cope and it is a way to write down what I feel. At this point in my life at 19 years old I feel like I am living by inertia I have not even began to live life and I am already tired of it.I do not live in the best of places in fact I would argue I live in a horrendous place. I see everything crumble around me and I see how I am trapped here where everything is just getting worse every day and I can only hope that I get a chance to get out. My country sucks my city sucks my household sucks I am practically poor and where I live there is no future. I had hopes of making it somewhere but as time passed I have just grown pessimistic after seeing that realistically I might not make it anywhere and I might end up living a miserable life before making it anywhere.I have been trapped inside my house for over a year now all my friends withered away if I ever had them in the first place. Everyone I liked to talk to online either ditched me or disappeared my social anxiety just worsened over time and so did my mental health. I need to deal with my mood swings with my depression with my trauma and with my ADHD and all of these are untreated I have tried everything to get access to any mental health professionals I even had others help me and at the end I could not do it. I still live with my family and they are not helpful at all the best they do is tell me that my problems either do not exist or do not matter and that there are people with worse problems than yours. I cannot even talk to them about much of it because some of it esteems from their constant emotional psychological and yes also physical abuse and the rest is just things I do not feel safe talking with them.Something traumatic happened late last year to me it is hard to explain and they knew what it was and after that event my mental health just went down the drain. They never cared they just got mad at me for my sudden change of behaviour and they did not even let me cope in any safe way which led me to copping in unsafe ones. So much happened ever since so many meltdowns so many nights of feeling hopeless so many dark thoughts.And now here I am in my winter break from university at 5 AM typing this when I could be going to sleep to fix my fucked up sleep schedule or at least do something fun but instead I feel completely apathetic and depressed I want to disappear. it is just too much trauma I have been backstabbed so many times I have been through so much everyone has taken advantage of me and almost everyone I ever liked disappeared as always. I feel hopeless and I feel worthless and I do not want to try anything anymore.I do not want to make new friends because I will eventually find a way to make them go away involuntarily or my anxiety will keep me away from them and our friendship will fade away. I do not want to get into another relationship because I am going to be abused again and I do not want to go through heartbreak again. I have lost interest in all my hobbies if I play the guitar or play a videogame it is usually not even fun anymore it just helps to temporarily kill the eternal boredom I feel and make me not think about things for a while until they catch on and I go back to feeling depressed as fuck.And so I live by inertia I wake up and follow the same routine every day I do not do anything interesting I do not expect anything good I just see every new day as another day to get through another day to deal with everything another day to wonder why I am in this situation and how I got here and why. And that last question ultimately kills me why? Why me? What have I done to deserve this? Why cannot I just be happy?I am tired of this. I do not want to die I just want to live without all this pain but things are not getting better and it certainly feels like they never will. Some stuff could be fixed with a lot of hard work but there are too many things that I will carry with me forever and I just do not know if I want to. I am tired of living by inertia only and only being able to feel sadness.,Depression
22417,22437,I really just want to get this off my chest and not be met with the same exact response that my friends and family have. it is not like my situation is particularly worse than anyone else's. I come from a middle class home have parents that really care about me and somehow still have friends that care too. I had great grades in middle school and through jalf of highschool with little to no effort being put in on my part and even had a pretty good amount of friends. But for some reason at around early junior year in high school I just started to feel different. And at the time that was the only way I knew how to explain it. I was simply not feeling like myself. I found myself not doing homework more and more instead of finishing it all in the last 10 min of class like I usually did. I found myself more and more dresding social interaction with everyone from my friends to my parents to even my gf. It did not start all at once and instead grew steadily over time and because of that I think I started to blame my surroundings in search of why I might be acting so differently. I wasam I do not know about now a pretty intelligent person in general. Not to say I am better or inately smarter than anyone but school always came easy to me growing up and because of that I found myself surrounded by some truly brilliant people... that I compared myself to constantly. The thing is that at first it actually served to bolster my confidence a lot. I would see the smartest kid in my grade and my good friend K make a 96 on a test and look at my 90 and think wow I am in the same league as him I must be smart. So when I started to make 80's 70's or fail the occasional assignment outright I took it as me failing to be good enough. It made me feel as though they were better than me and that I was simply not as good as them. But I think what really drove my anxious thoughts to a truly unhealthy point was when I started worrying about what they thought of me. I constantly worried about what my friends with near perfect sat scores and literal genius level iq scores thought about me thinking that if I did not continue to make good grades like them they would see me as weird or a bad influence or just someone who was undesirable to be around. My intelligence ended up betraying me in the end because I started cheating really really well. I will not go into detail because I am really not proud of it now but I got really good at cheating. I began cheating on most tests and quizzes and cheating on every homework without fail. It helped keep my head above water through my junior year making all A's and B's which was good enough for my parents most of the time and put to rest my anxiety about what my friends thought about me. However I knew what I was doing and it wore on me. How I could I go from legitimately slaying in the classroom... to this. In short i started to hate myself for what I was doing but saw no way out because it was that or be tormented by the other thoughts. Eventually I snapped and the pressure just made me break. I gave up completely feeling like a waste of space for letting everyone including myself down. I stopped doing assignments all together instead opting to watch YouTube through the 8 hour school day and play video games the second I got home as a way to make the days go by quicker and to chase away of of these thoughts. My parents being the great people they are really tried to make their divorce as non impactful on their parenting as they could and continued to try things like therapy antidepressants involving other family members and even letting live with my dad for a time to see if that helped. It did not. I felt the exact same and ended up feeling worse afterwards because I blamed myself that all of their effort went to waste on someone like me. I only managed to graduate because they managed to transfer me to an alternative leaning school 3 days before covid made the schools shut down nation wide. All this meant was that cheating became 10x easier and faster leaving more time for video games and YouTube. While all of this was going on I thought I would be a fantastic idea to get an online girlfriend that lived literally 1000 miles away that i would not be able to see for at least a year after talking to her for only a few months. I met her on an online game that we both played through a mutual friend and at first she was great. Funny smart quirky cool great music taste etc. Basically what I at the time thought to be the whole fucking package. Now we live together in my mom's house and in my time living with her I have grown more attached to her good qualities and painfully aware of her bad ones. She is by no means a bad person but rather a deeply troubled and traumatized girl with so so so much heart... and I can barely handle it. Her past trauma with her alcoholic family including but not limited to being shit faced for the first time at age 12 breaking up fights between her COMPLETELY shifted parents and older sister her older sister and mother verbally abusing her her family never taking her to the dentist or doctor etc. Honestly I could go on and to make it worse she survived all of that while defending her younger brother who is 7 years younger than her from as much as she could by herself. I know it makes what I am going through seem small but because of her past she can sometimes be really hard person to live with. She can get really really angry at small things to the point where she gets in my face and calls me a peice of shit and blocks my exit so I cannot leave has really bad impulse control and let us her eating and spending get out of control frequently despite very badly wanting to do the opposite has a pretty hard time taking no for an answer. Break up with her. Right? At least that what I would say to someone if I heard about that. I would say if you are not happy or getting what you need out of a relationship there is no reason to put yourself through that kind of strain. The thing is she is a really really sweet person who always manages to make me laugh always notices when I am not feeling happy surprises me with little displays of affection and is almost always willing to come to the table and talk about what is going on and what we can do to fix it. She shares most of my interests and what she is not really that invested in she learns about anyway and let us me show her and genuinely gives me her full attention when I talk about them. I end up feeling conflicted inside all of the time around her. it is really been wearing on me lately and in the last few months and I just do not know what to do. But wait... there is more! On top of all of that bullshit college is starting soon and I am extremely anxious about messing that up too. I fully understand the importance of college and the effect it can have on your future career and that makes it all the harder on me mentally. I am just tired of feeling like a disappointment and so desperately want to feel like I used to competent. If you slogged through that word vomit and are reading this now all I have to say is thank you. Any advice or kind words are welcome but not necessary at all. Tldr I made some really poor choices and feel too anxious and depressed to do anything about it. Made this account so my gf would not see this post. Just a sad story with a lot of self pity thrown in. This going to be a really long post and I am sorry,Depression

22510,22530,Hi so I have been a cutter for about 7 years. I have recently been clean for a few months andI think I have been day dreaming about self harm almost every day. My eye brow razors that is the first thing I think about my shavers pencil sharpeners anything sharp. I just want it. I can almost feel the tingly sensations where I used to do it most.Its literally calling my name its like an itch I cannot scratch. Its so hard and I feel so alone in this. Tw day dreaming about self harm,Depression
22547,22567,For the past 6 months I have been completely unable to make connections with people no matter how much I may want to. I am filled with rage and pessimism at the very thought of trusting someone. I feel like a parrot in social situations not contributing anything but just doing my best which is still not very good to mimic the emotions of the person that I am talking to. I have been depressed before but never this angry and just broken to the core. I have contemplated ending it all often these past few months because it seems that I hit a dead end everywhere I go and everyone I love and trust abandons me. I have some PTSD from my childhood as well which just makes me feel more broken and hopeless. I cannot make connections with people anymore,Depression
22556,22576,Complex I know. I love Reddit its the last place you think to find support and answers and often the first where you find them. I am 23 since 16 I have been mostly on my own been good at taking care of myself so family stopped bothering to care for me at 17. They left me alone at 17 for a year in a strange country while I worked 2 full time jobs and had the pressure of perfect grades. All because I wanted that perfect life. The fucking American dream hits once again.I do not have many friends I have never been popular and I felt alone most of my life. Clinged to the first girl that loved me at 16 and ended up with a classic if you leave Ill kill myself she left. And I tried. Not successfully evidently. 20 hits i move to college first goal achieved enter drugs party and social life. God Weed is like that checkpoint timer in the arcades for me always giving me and extra 30s of life. Then Acid came gLucy is so good in the process I found friends or more like stupid kids that like to do those stupid things too. And I loved it what else is there? You wake up eat trashy food get high do some more drugs with a group of friends you all laugh about whatever and suddenly you had the greatest night of your life. But for how long?I was always the last one to stop. The last one at the party. The last one to stop being irresponsible and getting back to my responsibilities. The last one to wake up. And I got dropped from the university. And again goals. I lied no one even knew I took a job started clases at the community college got clean from smoking weed daily doing stupid drugs like acid coke or combining stuff. Or just the ocasional Monday at 4pm bowl I was used to. And it was good a girl from this group and I became close 2 lost souls found purpose each other. She saves me I save her. All the while no one is saving anyone really. I got back to school different attitude I grew up 3 years in 6 months. I did not want to party because I knew I would end up in that spiral again. I started staying in more and more forgot about friends and stayed with her. She became the only person in my life. The pandemic helped what was a choice before became an obligation. We stay in only you and me and we enjoy life. I started smoking again daily multiple times. April May 2020 I do not remember not being high at all. But once I got back to work oh yeah I had been working full time nights for over a year while going to school I was able to maintain smoking working studying. Barely. But it was functional. I kept losing friends people became strange for me. I started staying in more and more but now not even her I would talk to. I would stay quiet play my game smoke my weed watch my movies. And I stopped feeling. I think I watched too many tv shows the perfect group of friends living in a big city challenged through life. This shows are for the Priviledged ones. I never mentioned all my friends in college. Came from wealthy families I was the Poor one. No one ever pointed that out I always felt it. It was like they had a family backing them they could be stupid and not worry about food tomorrow. I was the opposite I resented them but I wished I could be them. So I adopted their lifestyle and convinced myself I could by my own means put myself in their level. It was a challenge and it was exciting. My goal was I graduate I key a high paying job I move to a big city. I live the big city life and i become another one not happy not sad just another one with a life to carry him over not the other way around. So we set goals me and her would finish school get good paying jobs she is well off and her family can support her so she could afford to pursue her dreams and I always felt I could not I took for granted that she was going to make it she was the smart one the one with the good grades with the degree. It did not work. She moved back overseas where she came from. I was left alone. So I worked I did my all to move to the big city. I am here I have it. The good job the financial stability the big city the opportunities the freedom to do whatever I want. I feel zero. I feel like nothing ever changed. I feel like I just kept pointlessly reaching for that checkpoint seconds. I just kept adding and adding 30 seconds one at the time. But I have no sense no purpose I withdrew from everyone. Everyone is gone I am nothing but an afterthought. My best friends do not even bother and many of our conversations end with you do whatever you want dude is your life were here for you but I learned that the people who are here for you do not mention it. They just are. Its been a while since I have been suicidal. Before it was an anguish I wanted to make it stop. Today I do not want that I want to start it to feel to have something happen. I fill my time off work with irrational amounts of drugs. No one even knows all they think is I smoke but I have about tried anything to make myself feel again. I am so forgotten no one noticed when I started buying pills. I could die alone in a city of 3 million people no family nearby no friend to notice until I am truly gone. If I wanted I could say goodbye tonight no one to really stop me. However at the end all I want is to get high feel that soft breeze in my face when your chasing that brief moment of enjoyment where there is nothing but being relaxed. I could die tonight but All I want is to get high.,Depression
22588,22608,22m. I have always battled depression never has been this bad. I have 0 friends I can talk to I am too nervous how my parents will react if I try to seek help. I just hate everything about myself. I hate how I look how I talk how I act and especially how I think. I feel like I am just spectating my life and I have zero control. they say life goes fast but this life sentence is taking forever. when will my time be done? Trying to escape,Depression
22608,22628,I am 17 and my little sister is 10 years old. When we were younger we were two peas in a pod. I love her more than anything. Our relationship took a turn for the worst my freshmen yearly high school. The year before my parents had gotten divorced and it really took a toll on me mentally. It did not help that soon after my parents got divorced my mom made us move into her boyfriends house right away I still see my dad often. To this day I cannot say I am fully okay. But my little sister was not really bothered by the divorce. In fact she loved my moms new boyfriend and I was mad at her for it. I cannot explain why and that is not really the point of this post anyways. Sometime into my sophomore year things got really bad between my mom and her boyfriend. They started hitting each other breaking things and often times my moms boyfriend would storm out of the house leaving my little brother and sister to go and comfort my mom. My sister even slept with my mom sometimes. Things got so bad my mom and her bf from up and we moved houses and this is where my sister began to not be okay. My mom and her bf spend a couple months apart but it did not take long for them to get back together. We moved back in with her bf at the end of my junior year and now I am a senior. I noticed that something was right with my sister so I sat down with her in her room to talk. She bursted out crying when I asked her if she just wanted her big sister back to talk to her. Our relationship is slowly building up and we are slowly getting back to where we were. But today while I was doing my sisters hair I noticed she would not look at herself in the mirror when I asked her to put her head up she looked straight at the ceiling. Later while I was doing her hair still she began crying and she still will not tell me what is wrong. I am begging my mom to take my sister to therapy but she is a piece of garbage and at this point I might as well be the mom of my siblings. Please help me idk what to do. My little sister is depressed and I do not know what to do,Depression
22610,22630,summer depression sucks the most. there is so much to be enjoyed but no motivation to do so. i can see something like a sunset and logically understand its beauty but still feel nothing. i feel like potentially joyful moments are happening right in front of me but I am unable to appreciate or recognize them feels nothing,Depression
22614,22634,Hi Reddit. I just want to write down some thoughts about this night and I do not know where I can write it down. The last days and weeks were pretty rough. I was in a psychiatric hospital to stabilize my mood in a suicidal crisis for about 4 weeks. My Mum pressured to release me from the clinic because I have so much things to do. I will be getting 18 in under two weeks. So I have to go to many doctor appointments and to the city hall etc. So I was released from the hospital. In the hospital I made the promise to myself that I would never ever say to my therapists or anyone else that has not been in this situation that I am permanently suicidal and think of it every time. Because then they are putting me in the closed section or even give me permanent contact to a nurse which means you are not even allowed to go to the toilet alone. Just imagine having your peroid and changing your tampon or pad whilst someone is watching you.... But one of the worst parts is that you have nothing else to do as sitting in your room with a bed and a closed closet and a chair with a table. You may have a book or a little thing you will entertain yourself with. You are so bored. Occaisonally you are allowed to be in the group room which has a tv and a radio and some games. But only if you have not said that you are suicidal even though you are not about to kill yourself. You are so bored that you only think about how to get out of that situation. Either you successfully kill yourself or you do not say anybody something or you try to get better. So I think I have made the point why I do not want to tell my therapist about anything related to suicide. As I was released from the hospital I got my subscription for Fluoxetine and I take it. One ajor issue for me is that if I have stress with my mum i only can cope with cutting myself. It has gotten so deep that i had to get stitches so I had to tell my mum because she is the only one who has custody of me and the hospital is only allowed to sew my wound if she approves it. So I had to tell her. She does not know for sure that all of my scars and wounds from self harming come beacause she and I were having fights. That would be devastating for her after all she has done to me according to her point. She thinks she has done so many things and that I should be happy about having her as a parent. But I cannot. She pissed of my father so he never saw me and he committed suicide because of it. She has made so much debts thet I will inherit her debts she has not been there for me regarding emotional things and has not been establishing a stable relationship towards me. And that is just a little selction. I mean she tries it especially concerning physical things. I can learn Instruments and i can go to a swimming club I can go onto camps with the church etc. And everytime I say to her that she was not there for me she points out the physical things. I have said to her that I have very strong suicidal thoughts and she did nothing. After I tried it she was shouting to me. She made me feel unloved. Because I have noone. I have friends that I can go to but what should they do? They arewere also kids. I would be such a big burden to them. And teachers you might say? I can not trust anybody because nobody ever helped me when I said that I needed help. The first time I was admitted to the hospital a teacher which I had for over 8 years came to me since my notes and appearance and turnins dropped. She asked me and she saw that I was not good. She came to me. She said that she sees that i am not alright. And as my first reflex was to tell her that I am ok she said that I am not. And then she said I am not myself. I am not ok. And then I borke down. Finally after over 12 Years someone noticed that I am not alright. I was not ablle to play my role. I could not hide my depression anymore. I seemed to function on the surface but she noticed the subtle signs. She came to me when i could not come to her and she had not slacked her efforts. My Mum on the other hand Ignored me for 3 montsh straight did not talk to me did not come into my room to ask how i am going. Nothing. She did not care. She does not care. The whole time I was in school I dreamt about my teachers being my parents. It was clear for met that they are different as parents and that they never could be but it was my dream. I wished myself a stable person which loved me emotionally and that would be older than me. That could take care of when I could not. I was jealous of the teachers kids. I was jealous of my friends. Because they had both parents. One has splitted parents but he sees both of them regularly. Back to the topic I am cutting myself because of stress with my mum and me feeling alone an being not worthy of love. Btw her love was not unconditional it was coupled to not say anything against her etc. We had a dispute about my future as a voulnteer and she shouted to me. I went in my room and tried to calm myself. I tried to say that this was just a booboo and it would not happen again that she will hate me. But I could not. I have fear about the future. And other things going around so I am clearly on the edge with my emotions. I cut myself deeply i had to get stitches. On wednesday we had another confrontation. I have not spoken to her since then. Everyday I cut myself. This night my cuttingsession was 2 hours long. never have I ever cut so long and so much. I have cut my wrist my thigh my arm my foot my tummy. Normally i just cut my thigh and every now and then my arm. I think some wounds should get medical attention but I can not. I have no will to get out of bed. And then my mum has to be noticed. The one thing that bothers me the most is that she has never excused herself for anything. She never exscused herself for being late for not keeping agreements for lying to me for anything. And I think she never will. Because she says I have to be grateful that she gifted me with the life and so on. But I do not want to live.... Thanks that I can write it down here. At least I would be pleased when it would not get deleted nobody has to read this. I just wanted it to be written down. But if you have read this thanks for hearing me. This night is pretty hard.,Depression
22624,22644,My twin betrayed me and it cost me some of my vision. I have no one to talk to besides my mom. I really want to be held but no one loves me that way. I just got rejected by someone who never really cared anyways. I just need to hear positivity to get me through today. It will take 7 years if I am lucky to get my eyes back. I am REALLY trying to see the positives. I wish I could sleep till then because sleeping is the only escape from reality right now. I cannot even run away from my problems. I need some positive words please,Depression
22632,22652,Besides like...living you know. For me was sleeping and eating and also working without several panic attacks during my shift. I would like to know your experience. I feel alone in this shit. WHAT ARE SOME THINGS DEPRESSION MADE HARD FOR YOU TO DO?,Depression
22636,22656,it is one of those nights.i lack the vocabulary hell perhaps there are not enough words in the english language or any language to convey the hole that loneliness burns through one's chest cavity. it is acidic it feels as if loneliness is gnawing through my ribcage and attacking the chambers of my heart piece by piece. it is methodical it is diabolical it feels like the epitome of selfdestruction.it is embarrassing it is devastating it feels like i am living someone else's life that was not meant to be my own. i thought that by this time in my life 24f i would have a group of friends a significant other things to look forward to and a stable career with opportunities for growth. i do not know where i went wrong. i do not know what happened or how i got here friendless and loveless at an age where i should have my life together by now where i should at least have some semblance of an idea of where i am heading.the feeling of disappointment is unbearable. i feel like i let my parents down i feel like i let myself down i feel like i do not deserve anything. most days i feel as if it would be better if i just faded away in my sleep then no one would have to worry about me and what will become of me. the only reason i am still here is because i do not wish to put my parents through the pain of taking away the only life they created to throw away all their dreams and ambitions. the problem is i cannot live up to any of them. i cannot live up to the expectations i cannot live with the thought of not making them proud i cannot live with myself. it is agony this loneliness. it is agony to watch others living their best lives sharing cuteintimate moments with their partners living life as it is meant to be lived. i feel absolutely disgusting for feeling this touchstarved for feeling this devoid of affection of romance of physical touch. i would give my last breath to just be held and assured that everything will be okay that i am not a disgusting worthless waste of space that i am desired and wanted. that there is a point to all of this. it hurts. it hurts to breathe it hurts to live. i wish i could give my life to someone who has something to live for who has the courage and motivation and willpower to make something of themselves. i feel my heart physically disintegrating in my chest.,Depression
22639,22659,I am 16 and have receding gums joining the very long list of things I cannot stand about myself.If I got out of bed and brushed my teeth Id be happier.Please brush your teeth. Even if you do nothing else that day please just that one thing. Brush your teeth.,Depression
22684,22704,My life has taken a huge turn for the better. All though high school I was extremely depressed and when I finally got out I hoped it would be better. I tried to go to college but I flunked out and that of course just made everything worse. I went back home got a crappy job at an Applebees and started dating a crappy guy. The guy and I got into tons of fights. He was stealing from me. He lived in my apartment for free and he brought his other girlfriend over and fucker her on my couch. I only found out when I decided to get Instagram again and found his profile and that said he was dating someone else and she told me she went to his place and they had sex on his couch. I found her lip gloss in my couch a month after I threw him the hell out. I was livid. After hun and I broke up I got even more depressed I spent a whole week in my bed crying. I ended up downloading whisper and when guys started hitting on me I did not stop them. Eventually I stupidly went to one guys place because I was lonely. I told him I was dtf but not anal. Of course he gets me a red solo cup of wine and when I am only nursing it he starts pressuring me to drink more telling me I can stay the night. I did not finish the cup but I did drink more after that. Then he starts giving me edibles. I got to the point where I was almost completely out of it. He tied me up and fucked my ass. I then proceeded to just into yet another toxic as hell relationship with an guy who was married and told me he was in an open relationship but of course never let me actually meet his wife. That was a disaster. Hes getting a divorce now. Allegedly having nothing to do with me but do we really believe that folks? I got a new job and my boss started sexually harassing me. Literally invited me to an orgy. He also like to hit his dab pen in the office and I got a bad habit of joining him. That never got worse than that tho because this is when I started to see the light at the end of the tunnel. My boyfriend and I started dating shortly after I got that job. Hes the most amazing man I have ever met. He cares for me. Really cares. He loves me and I love him. I got another serving job again and stayed there for about 6 months before finally getting into an office job.Now I am happier than I have ever been. My job is great for me and has helped my mental health a ton. My bf and I have been together 10 months and are going strong. I just want to put out there that no matter how bad life seems it can get better. Thank you for reading my story. TLDR my life sucked now my life does not suck. I am glad I never committed suicide.,Depression
22689,22709,I have failed so much throughout my life and i continue to fail. My wish is to forever be remembered especially through music but how long will people remember me? Will i be forgotten?My accomplishments throughout my life are unnoticed and i feel like i wasted my life. I have just failed over and over. If i fail again is there a reason to continue knowing how much ill keep failing? I feel so unaccomplished,Depression
22705,22725,I feel like i want to die i need my dad. I do not understand how this happened. This all feels like a dream It hurtsb,Depression
22725,22745,I cannot do anything right. I keep doing what I believe is the right thing to do and it ALWAYS is the wrong thing. Why try and do anything why even be a live if everything I do is wrong... I wish I did not exist... I am tired of trying... I cannot live with another people because as soon I get criticise my mind goes back to I cannot do anything right. I want help but I do not know what would even help at this point in my stupid pointless life. Maybe I should just kill myself... I cannot do anything right,Depression
22734,22754,I am constantly in a state of existential dread. I feel like I am going to die or the earth will first do nothing matters. It makes it hard to find desire for anything because it all seems pointless. It does not help that I am terrified of dying its not that I want to die I just wish I was never alive. Does anyone struggle with existential dread daily? I feel like it takes over all my thoughts all the time Existential Dread,Depression
22743,22763,I have struggled with this shit my whole life but sometimes is just too much man. I am usually in a state where I am functional and can tolerate life but sometimes the pain is too much I just want to rip my heart out of my chest. I will have to work in the worst place I could ever imagine. I am finishing college and it seems like I just waste my time and money cuz I just ended in the worst scenario for me. More depressed than I ever been more tired than I ever been.People is always with fucking motivational bullshit telling me to be greatful for what I have and the fucking opportunity to be exploited in a shitty company. I can feel this shit possess me and go through my chest,Depression
22754,22774,My friends do not seem to care when I try to tell them I do not feel good they seem tired of me.. Does people only want to talk to people who are or look happy ? Also I always feel lonely especially at night so I crave to talk to someone but I have nothing interesting to say so I just say Hi to people they go Hey! and then nothing and I feel even worse.. I feel lonely and I hate it. I go from hating my friend to hating myself for not being a good friend etc. Can someone talk with me ? I cannot stand feeling lonely,Depression
22755,22775,My 30's have come to an awful start. I lost a 5 year relationship I have no family left I got about 3 friends who are doing their own thing and I just feel so alienated and lonely anymore. I thought I had a handle on things for a while I thought I had something to work for and something to hang on to but I really do not. I am delaying the inevitable and I think honestly would be the best time to take myself out of this world. Anything I have attached myself to or put work into has been a dismal failure. I do not see things getting much better for me. I will always have PTSD I will always feel alienated I will always need fucking braces to walk I will always feel like something good that happens in my life will end in the worst possible way. I feel just alienated and done with it all.,Depression
22773,22793,I always feel so potently the difference between what I want and what I have. I know if I could not desire anything I would not be depressed. But that is not possible that is what drives humans on. So even when I improve in aspects of my life I am never content as there is always a 'better'. I can literally think back to every moment every interaction and every relationship and think how I could have done better. Now I am depressed and I can feel relationships crumbling around me as I try to balance them with my mental health. And of course most people do not really care about your mental health they care about the side of you that appeals to then which is not you depressed. I feel like my life is drifting by and I am just a spectator and cannot affect anything. If I never wanted anything I would never be sad,Depression
22798,22818,Hi so I have this friend me and her are extremely close. She also suffers with depression and I have been there and dropped everything when she has those depressive episodes and I have always supported her and tried to help her the best I could. Last night I crashed and had one of these episodes where I felt really low and suicidal I ended up ignoring everyone and just sat there by myself she messaged me a few times asking me if I was okay and I did not respond until today because I just felt so low and I just could not. I told her I crashed and that I am fine and she did not seem too fussed or bothered by it but then I am just texting her normally as I would and she asks me if I have got a problem because I must of been texting unenthusiasticly because of what happened and now she is ignoring me on purpose and talking to someone else it just makes me feel like shit because I am always supportive and always caring about her but then she is just ignoring me and she has not offered to call me or asked me if I want to do anything she just asked me if I was okay and I feel like that is just the bare minimum I feel like shit and this has just made me feel so much worse and I do not know what to do what do I say to her to let her know I feel like this without coming across as an assholeThanks in advance Am I an asshole expecting help?,Depression
22820,22840,But no one else would be able to replace him so no one else can have my heart..Being on my own is killing me but I would rather be alone than make new memories with anyone else.. Being alone sucks and hurts like hell,Depression
22903,22923,I do not know if it is just me who deals with this but I never honestly confess my true depressed thoughts if anyone asks about my mood. It just feels so wrong and almost attention seeking I do not want to be a burden for anyone. So I just pretend to be okay although most of my friends know of my diagnosis and struggles. But as soon as anyone else opens up about not doing okay I feel so wrong and disgusted by myself. I feel sorry for them and bad myself. I feel like garbage for telling them I had a good day right before them confessing they have not. I hate this. Feeling bad because others are able to confess their depressed feelings but not me,Depression
22991,23011,What I do not understand is that when I am workingdistracted everything seems fine and then when I have nothing to do walking on the street or just hanging I am depressed. Is this a common thing? Relaxing causes depression,Depression
22993,23013,I am not really good at communicating myself very well so I really apologize in advance. Every single day seems to be either me working and on weekends just doing nothing. If I do go out it is me being alone. I have tried reaching out with people tried to do meetups tried to do whatever to get friends but nobody includes me in anything. To be honest I am the most boring ugly and mundane person ever without any notable skills or hobbies so I really do not blame them for not wanting to include a deadweight like me around. This is something my entire life has been like. The very few friends I have had growing up have all moved on and do not talk to me anymore. One even ghosts me. The people I know online avoid me. In fact I know they do. I just recently I learned they had a group chat without me because I am that bad. I just remembered that last year when I lost my job I posted my suicide note on my social media went out to the store and was as very close to buying a gun. I was so close but I chickened out at the last second. When I got home I got one message and they were more upset than concerned. Next time will be different and I am not going to chicken out. I promise that. I do not go out with people and nobody wants me around do do stuff with. If I do go out I do everything alone. I even go out of my way to hide my face because I am very unpleasant to look at.Why am I on here complaining really? Nothing is going to change. Nobody is going to read this and nobody is going to cry when I am gone. Unable to connect with people and wasting my life away.,Depression
23002,23022,Where do I start. I am in my mid 20s I come from an extremely repressive Muslim family and I still live with them I have been set up in 4 failed arranged marriages I am not allowed to leave the house wearing what I want I am living with 2 disabled parents who neglected me my entire life that have done a whole lot to parentify me. My older sister escaped and ran away at 17 nearly ten years ago and I wish I did the same but the burden and responsibility to take care of my parents fell on my hands from a young age of 16. I have no friends no resources. My parents are both uneducated. My other family members get violent toward me. my rapist is in prison and my stalker will not stop harassing me with false police reports. I also have broken a few hearts so I am scared of my exes knowing where I live. Sometimes I am too terrified to leave the house. Since my parents are uneducated and never worked and only were on disability raising us in poverty and never trying I cannot ask them for career advice. I am the only one with a college education and I still have to thank my guidance counselors for helping me every step of the way but even then I was scared to be too needydependent and ask them for help because I was always abused growing up and my existence feels like a burden. Sorry for rambling. People tell me to get a job here but people do not understand that a job means being trapped in that location. I tell people I want to work elsewhere but they keep shutting me down telling me to start small where I live. But the desire to leave is urgent for my physical and mental wellbeing. My point is People constantly tell me why do you want to work in ? Different state you can just do that in New Jersey. Stay there. Be around your family. This is what makes my blood boil. Its hard to figure out how to tell people that this place is dead to me and Ill probably end up dying here if I was to stay any longer. I do not know how to tell people that I am ready to move on and spread my wings because there is this huge back story that nobody knows. I tend to hold the weight of this on my own. How can I do that? I want to mostly leave for my safety and for a new beginning. I cannot stay here much longer. Anyway to tell these people? I am horrible at communicating my points so this is why I need help. I want to leave I am done living here. I wish others stopped telling me to stay.,Depression
23015,23035,I have been struggling with depression for a long time and now. I made a lot of self destructive decisions and I am losing everything that I felt my identity was made up of. I am alone have no friends a husband that hates me. I do not know where to go from here and I wish I did not have to do this anymore. My life feels like it is over,Depression
23066,23086,One thing that helps me with depression is to just get up and go for a drive. Just drive,Depression
23128,23148,I just wish that life was different. My life is not even that bad on the outside I have a great family I live in a decent area I do not really have many external struggles and when I say that I do not mean to brag I am simply saying it for a little bit of context. I am 19 years old and for as long as I can remember I have just had this emptiness inside of me. I do not like to talk about it a lot with the people around me but it really is something that just eats at me. It feels like there is no middle ground for my emotions. One minute I can feel like life is great and the next I just wish I had not been born in the first place. I just wish I was not here. I have felt this way since I would say I was around 11 or 12. It feels like any bit of happiness I get is just a temporary high but I always come down and sink into this dark place that I cannot crawl out of. No matter what I just always end up finding myself in this pit. I just think of how I wish none of this had ever happened I could have just not been born. I think about suicide a lot but its not something I truly want to act on. Its not that I want to die I do not truly want to die I just wish Id never been here. I am not necessarily afraid of death it feels like I am just kind of waiting for it to happen. I would not search for it but I am also not afraid of it happening. Id like to think that it would be comforting to know that everything just goes away. It would just be over. No more stress no more sadness no more worrying about this or that just the peaceful notion that I do not have to deal with anything anymore. Does anybody else feel this way? I am tired of living a day to day life and feeling like I am trapped in this reality I want nothing to do with. I just want to be at peace. I just wish it had never happened in the first place. I just wish it was over,Depression
23138,23158,I just want to be happy and by myself. I never really learned how to talk to girls but part of me is happy I did not. Both of my past relationships somehow happened but a part of me hated being in them. I was always paranoid they were talking to other guys or they lost interest in me. In the end it did not matter cus they are both exs now. I just like being able to do whatever I want whenever I want. I can smoke or drink as much as I want and no ones going to be upset at me. I can play all the video games I want and I do not have to FaceTime anyone. I can hang out with anyone I want without worrying about beef between girlfriends. Maybe I do not like to be controlled maybe I am controlling either way its for the best I am not in a relationship. I do not want love,Depression
23153,23173,Everyone in this sub is really supportive and i just want to give something back Writing and talking about depression really helps a lot but i guess some of us lack the motivation to do so. So if you are reading this feel free to share your story in the comments and let others and me of course comment on it. Share your story,Depression
23189,23209,title says it all. i have to start taking my meds again starting today and i really do not want to. they ended up working and making me feel stable and that is the reason on why i stopped taking them for a while. i hate the feeling of being stable or feeling normal. it does not feel right it feels wrong. I am going to miss the comfort in being sad i do not want to get better,Depression
23194,23214,TLDR these are ramblings may or may not make sense. I am just extremely tired.If you have any advice for this Id love to hear it. Not even sure what would help at this point.I just had a realization. I am the quiet kid the one everyone is secretly scared of. I play songs about suicide in front of people nodding along to it like its a goddamn Christmas carol. I am exactly like my dad was this age and have had a son a lot longer being the only one actually present in my little brothers life as he was growing up even if a lot of it was us fighting for moms attention. And I do not know why I am feeling so much spite for my mother tonight. Though it might have been due to last year when she kicked me out of the house for being too sick and not able to lift and move a destroyed 20ft she would for her even though earlier that day she saw me outside soon after the generic natural disaster sawing trees that had fallen across the driveway. Then having to come in and lay down because I could barely breathe and was sweating beads. I am thinking it might have been COVID19. Subsequently spending the night in the bed of my 91 5speed ranger with knob windows and key locks loved that truck but after the damage from that storm insurance totaled it. Now I almost feel like she has whether purposely or accidentally raised me to be a massive simp. Id venture to say having a giant mom complex that spreads to every girl I am attracted to. Where it is now to the point where I am taking care of her 14 year old son. but not able to provide what he needs as I am at work all day and hes with friends most afternoons. While she is trying to live her best life 2 and a half hours away. More power to people doing that I am just salty from having to play dad since the age of 6. And I have silently been loathing her since getting kicked out like I have always done to my dad. Speaking of which Id say its almost like a spiteful competition. Where I always have to be better than him silently protesting the worthiness he never gave me. Sorry that one looks like a grammar question from the ACTSAT. I am getting help with the mental issues that I am sure are obvious by now. But I just feel like I am a fuckup and it got a lot worse once I realized I am exactly like my dad. I failed life already time for game over. If you have gotten this far sorry for having to read this. I am going to go to bed now NOT kmsing. Tired ramblings,Depression
23200,23220,I cannot deal with the fact I have to stay alive to be a human and that I still exist. I find morning so difficult to deal with. I will stay in my room until 12. I was at my sort of partners house yesterday and I needed to catch the 9.45 am train to get into work at 11. I took the 10.30 am train and was about 10 minutes late. I just cannot get myself going I just find the mornings too hard. Is anyone's mood a lot worse in the mornings?,Depression
23224,23244,because I always want to fucking kms I sexually identify as a unit of speed,Depression
23246,23266,But I want to take drugs so I can feel happy. I just want to feel nothing no pain no hurting. I want to feel like I am jumping on clouds.

23385,23405,HiI am a 28 year old she will of a man from the UK suffering with severe depression and most likely an undiagnosed mental illness!I entered such a dark corner of my mind that I tried to take my own life in 2016 and I lost my bottle at the very last moment now I am what I call stuck alive.I saw the potential effects that my suicide would have had everyone told me how upset they were and how distraught they would be if i died.I also remember being distraught distraught that I had lost my bottle and been saved distraught that I had woken up in the nightmare I tried to escape from.Ever since that day I have been stuck alive too depressed and suicidal to achieve anything believe anything want anything feel anything... Angry at myself and everyone else that I am not dead and do not have the bottle to end it my step brother died a couple of years ago from an accidental recreational drug overdose and I wished it was me he was only 18! Why is the world so cruel?This of course highlighted again how devastating a death in the family would be.Each day that passes I slip deeper and deeper into despair I know this is happening I just cannot stop it meanwhile my partner of 13 years has become a fulltime alcoholic that blames me for every problem she has within herself I am openminded but something tells me if she left me she would quickly discover these kind of problems are rampant within people our age.I am struggling to see the point anymore prepandemic I was doing my dream job still wanted to kill myself but found myself being too busy to even think about it that much... It was more of an inconvenient intrusive thought at that stage.We scraped our way through doing any work that was available being mistreated at each company of course I fear the mental scars that my partner and I now both have on top of our preexisting issues is just too much to return to normality.She is pressuring me to have a child people our age tend to feel like we are failing due to seeing previous generations achieve things that are 10x harder for us to facilitate like providing security and stability for a child!I am receiving professional help albeit very slowly via the NHS but the poor buggers are overrun as usual and things do not move quickly at all I am wondering if other people can relate to this permanent lust for what is quite simply a smidge of happiness I have never felt joy or pride or love and that is all I have ever wanted I do not need money I just want fulfillment I just want to wake up in the morning with no immediate desire to die!Let me know if you relate I seem to feel better hearing other people relate to me otherwise I convince myself I am the problem! Maybe I am??? Am I Dead?,Depression
23386,23406,anyone else who is attempted sewerslide feel such guilt for putting your loved ones through that? it weights heavily on my shoulders daily its a weight that makes my depression worse a vicious cycle. guilt after attempts,Depression

23408,23428,Everybody hates me. My roommate who is supposed to be my best friend hates me. She will not admit it but she does. We do not do anything fun together. We do not spend any time together. We just coexist or we are fighting. I think she is grown to resent me more and more as time has went on. Its just another failed friendship. Another thing I fucked up. Without her I do not have any friends. Even my dog likes Erin more. She always wants to spend time with her and not with me. She never wants to be around me. I am a bad trainer and owner. I have no one to talk to. Everyone is tired of listening to me. They get mad or frustrated or depressed or anxious if I talk about how I feel. I have a therapist but I only talk to her for an hour a week and it does not really help anyways. Even my parents do not want to listen anymore. I should just shut up. I should just not exist at all. I do not have any friends or any reason to live. I keep trying but its all useless. I wish I was dead. I wish I never existed. I am tired of feeling so alone and tired and useless and like a failure all the time. I am tired of fighting every day. I am so tired. I am never going to be good enough. I am never going to be loved. I just want it all to stop I do not have anything new or interesting to say,Depression
23424,23444,I am so sad and cannot stop crying. I worked so hard despite struggling with ADHD and all my mental illnesses every step of my life. I went to a good school and studied neuroscience but every time I talk to my peers I realize how far behind I really am and how I do not get things. I am just stupid.I worked so hard and got a good job... but I am doing terribly. I do not dislike it I am just BAD at it. If I fail this training my boss has to retrain me on everything.. and I do not think there is any way I can pass it. it is so hard. I am supposed to complete one case a day minimum... and I have just spent 10 hours on the shortest case you can get. I just feel so helpless and terrified that I have no future. I hate this so much. I do not know what to do with my life. I just wish it would all end. I got a good job and I am doing really bad,Depression
23441,23461,For some reason or anotherI am here. I exist.,Depression

Procrastinating??,Depression
23501,23521,I am 15 and have been depressed for years not told a single person out of a combination of fear and humiliationmy family is extremely insensitive to metal disordersI do not want to reach out to an adult because my family would find out technology is one of the few things that keep me sane and that would all be either destroyed or sold I have considered talking to a close friend about it so I have someone Ik to talk to I do not know how he feels about metal problems. I fear he would tell somebody and only make it harder.the only way to get a therapist would be to inform my parents I am sick of being alone,Depression
23512,23532,All I want to see now is the world end. I hope all life gets wiped and everything on this planet dies. I am sick of seeing the suffering in everyday life. If there was a button to make everything on this planet disappear I would press it. The bad in life outweighs the good in it. I want to die with the worldI'm sorry I just wanted to get this off my chest. Yup I am beyond saving. I am mentally damaged,Depression
23516,23536,I worked out twice hard and long today. Meditated. Should feel a bit better right? Nope. My face is ugly no matter how buff I get. I am pissed the fuck off. Too miserable inside to ever love or date. I got bad anger issues man ffs. Fuck this life it hurts so much! Have too many demons and they constantly try to haunt me no matter how much I talk about it. I hate my fucking life,Depression
23542,23562,I am always told that if I want to get better I have to work towards it. Well I cannot seem to work up the motivation to take those first steps. It seems the longer I do not take care of this the less motivated I am which continues the cycle. Where do you guys get the motivation to work towards being better?,Depression
23556,23576,So my girlfriend had some traumatic dating experience. So we had a fight regarding one of the experience and we did not handle it well. We sort of broke up after that but then again patched up. Her past stories kind of hurts me too which is why I cannot listen to them properly and she hesitates as well. So recently she is been feeling really down and got to know that she has depression. I really want to help her go through this phase. Also we cannot afford therapy now. So what should i do to make her feel better and how to deal with her depression. Really need advices My girlfriend has depression and i want to support her in every way I can,Depression
23580,23600,I always feel so guilty when being sad. Like i have everything a kid could wish for a roof over my head mostly loving family etc. But i still cannot be happy. There are people with real problems but for some reason i think i have the right to be sad and that is fucking egoistic. I could have the best fucking day of my life but I would still be sad at the end of it.I have only one friend but that friend is strugling with her own mental health so i do not want to but another burden on top of her. Oh btw that right there was also something a selfcentered person would say why should somebody care about me? it is very egoistic to think that i matter enough to make a diffrence to anybody.I also have diagnosed asperger syndrome and i fucking hate it. I CAN read peoples emotions normally aspies cannot according to google but i do not know how to react and I am veryvery uncomfortable in social situations espesially with people of my own age 1315 . And surprisesurprise i have emotions of my own.And I am a boy so it seems not okay for me to be sad. But i am. And that is fucking egoistic.If you read so far then well concratiolations you just wasted solid couple of minutes from your life. I feel so guilty,Depression
23594,23614,I feel so sad today I cannot stop crying. All I want to do is listen to sad music. I am so alone. No friends no job 1 year separate from my boyfriend who I still love. I hate my life. I hate having a mental illness and ending up in the hospital. I hate who I am. I hate being alone I cannot make any lasting friendships I cannot find a partner who loves me. I hate this world. Why has my life turned out this way? I am really sad and alone,Depression
23602,23622,I am 20. I do not understand why I am alive to be honest. I do not have any intention of killing myself but I find it hard to care about anything these days. And from what I can tell life itself seems meaningless overall. Not to be nihilistic or anything but I genuinely see no reason to even keep going. Most of the time I do not feel anything besides meh. or I seem apathetic. I am content being alone and I am the kind of person who is happy as long as I have any kind of something around me to entertain myself with. As it currently stands my depression seems to have taken a nosedive. I have not showered in 3 days because I do not feel like it. We also do not have any hot water at the moment and so if I do shower I have to do it in the stupidest way possible and I do not even feel clean afterwards. Basically I was taught when this happens boil water mix it with some cool water pour it in sink and use a washcloth to wipe yourself down. Stupid and takes way more effort than a regular shower. And I do not feel like taking a cold shower. And I mean realistically if I died tomorrow nobody would notice for a long time. Not even work because I work minimum wage and they would just assume I would quit or something. My grandparents do not need me. My parents do not care where I am or what I am doing they are busy raising my siblings or getting high. it is been like that since I was a baby though. My grandparents would find my body if I were to die and probably be sad but I feel like that is only because of the fact they raised me. They would actually benefit if I was gone seeing as to how often they complain about how miserable their life currently is. How broke they are ect. I feel like I do not really exist except to make them happy because I am always their emotional support child. They argue and yell all the time. Just this morning my grandpa decided to start an argument because my grandma grabbed the wrong bowl. She said she wished she had never left my aunts houseShe went to visit last week and my grandpa said he wished she stayed too. Then of course she comes into my room crying then she makes my favorite meal then comes to announce that she made my favorite meal and then let us herself into my room to make my bed. This stuff is her way of trying to make herself feel better it is not out of genuine love I do not think. Because if I am in a bad mood and I do not immediately perk up it must be her fault and she will start crying even more. there is no escape from the negativity. I have to fake my happiness obviously because her feelings depend on mine. I hate it and there is no escape from the negativity.I mean I found roommates that hopefully I will be moving out with soon. But even then I am not sure life will get any better. Because I am pathetic enough that most people think there is something wrong with me and see me as a walking red flag. I am of course poor as well so you know add that onto it. But I have been saving up my money. I just do not know what to do with any of it. I have been saying I want to go to college but I have no idea what I want to do with my life. And I do not know why I would go to college yet I do not want to waste my money on something I might never use or might not even like. There are a lot of people out there who view me as a loser because I smoke weed play video games work and am not in college. To add onto that everyone acts like you should strive to better yourselfBut in my opinion I am not sure what I should better about myself. Or why. To make it so I am more tolerable to you? Because if I do not see you putting in the same effort why would I put in all the work so you can freeload? If that makes sense. I mean I am just here to vent at the moment. But I am not really upset. Or sad even. I am not sure what I am feeling but it is neither hopeless nor hopeful. I do not see a reason to keep going,Depression
23610,23630,I see an overarching theme here where people are deciding whether or not they want to stay or go. They often decide they want to go but yet cannot bring themselves to do it. I also observe that many here are young so I wanted to add another perspective. everyone is situation is different and I am not here to recommend anything but I can tell you when it comes to living with depression it does not get better with time. Depression is a very selfish and selfcentered disorder. We obsess over ourselves how we have affected others and how we feel. We also obsess over how the people we leave behind would feel with us being gone. We consider those who we have hurt in life but we fail to consider this the countless others we are going to hurt. When I think of all of the pain I could have spared people it becomes overwhelming. The marriages I ruined the relationships the children I brought into the world. You think its painful to disappoint your parents? Failing your children is a pain 100 times worse. Exposing those who love youwhom you are supposed to protectto the addiction abuse the emotional absence and all of the other awful things that come along with depression is horrible. Then you find yourself in a place where you cannot leave because you are a provider and you cannot devastate your children. Its like being in one of those movies where going to hell is being damned to live the same day over and over. And all you have to look forward to is growing old the loss of family members the decline of your health financial struggles and career failures. Yeah things could get better. But if you are wired as badly as we are this is highly unlikely. Not only will things get worse for you but you will ruin the lives of people you have yet to meet some of whom have not yet been born. Consider all of this as you decide whether you want to stay or go. Maybe it will get betterprobably it will not,Depression
23612,23632,As the days go on I get more and more numb at the thought of suicide. Its Thursday and I have been numb since Sunday. I went to the beach at night and I just wanted to jump in so bad. Right in front of my friends. Monday I slept all day and thought about what I would put in my note. At least I made something. Tuesday I could not sleep and when I took my daily meds I had a horrifying episode. I went to the mental hospital but of course they would not take me. I talked with my friends but I just felt like a burden the whole time. Why does everything always have to be about me. Wednesday I try to recover from my injuries from the day before. Partner buys me medical supplies to help and then gets upset because he does not know how to support me. We contemplate breaking up. Today is Thursday woke up fine. Crocheting my friends stuffed frogs as a thank you for being my friend gift. I already said I wanted to die in the group chat to no response I guess they thought I was joking. I reach out to my partner and tell him I am going back to bed because I cannot handle life today. No response. I guess I fucked that up too. I am so alone. Nobody wants anything to do with me because I am a burden. Praying that one of my friends or even my partner reaches out to me for comfort. I need it so bad I feel lost and alone with nowhere to go but bed. Maybe I just need to face the fact that I will always be alone no matter what. Its been so long,Depression
23627,23647,I am going to be ending my school years in a few months and I got out of a relationship almost a year ago it lasted one year I have been a loud and obnoxious guy ever since I was little it helped me find people and try to fit in but slowly I started to become more quiet and distance myself. I did not think much of it until I got into a relationship an year ago I felt good for the first few months but deep down I knew this was not it and I knew I cannot keep her in the dark like this I told her I felt alone and that I felt as if no one really to appreciates me she tries her best to comfort me and to this day I will always appreciate itbefore I realized itjealousy guilt and mixed emotions fucked me up. we have had many fights and we tried making things work for the majority of our relationship this is not it. I knew that and I knew I could not keep it going so I called it off. I knew she was not it and the breakup was in a way mutual because she confessed was losing feelings midway aswell I felt like shit. but do I have the right to?I had a few friends before this most of them were her friends after we broke up.. nobody came to me nobody even checked on me not even my friends. I felt so alone. but I knew this would happen but it still hurts after we broke up I was still friends with her it was poisonous. because it was tempting me to do it all again make up get together and feel the same things again and break upand I can tell it is bad for her toowe needed to part ways so I cut it off my friends and her I told her that I am going to be cutting her off and she respectfully did the same because she knew it is the best thing to do as for my friends..? I do not even see them mention my name ever since I broke up nobody cares.it is been so lonely. I barely even see my family either and their not the type to understand but I appreciate that they even let me stay in their life I have been craving attention anything.. but nobody really caresas I said I have been quiet I do not have the energy to try and make friends or fit in I want to so bad but the fear of rejection and the thought of me just looking cringe worthy Infront of others plague meso I sit alone in my room checking social media apps and seeing everyone live their life while I am daydreaming of everything I can never have my motivation is running slow and I cannot go a night without having a breakdown after midnight and because of quarantine there really is nothing to do so I do not have a better distraction but I feel so guilty for being the way I am and I feel so jealous of everyone else. but lately I have been feeling something other than just loneliness been feeling empty and just depressed I have thought of suicide but I have always thought about my family. the only ones that truly care even if they do not understand or know what I am going through I know they care.but it is lonely and empty living like this I play the guitar and sing songs every night to do something other than staring at a screen but I cannot do it forever I am sorry for the lengthy paragraphs I have wanted to talk about this for a long time and I thought maybe this would be the right place me being anonymous so I will not get so much anxiety I feel guilty that I am here complaining about this while I see posts about people going through tougher and more dire things I am sorry if I sound like I am exaggerating my dive into feeling empty and alone,Depression
23643,23663,Is it normal to be 17 without a job? I keep getting rejected or not getting any messages back meanwhile my mates are on about 1000 a month Hes also 17 with a kid on the way and his own flat and I am doing nothing my sister just got this big promotion and its making me feel shit about myself I have no clue what to do Life,Depression
23644,23664,I am sad some days and some days I am happy and some days I am whatever. When I am sad I will cry and be in a bad mood for a couple days then be better once it passes and think I was being dumb or over dramatic for being so sad. When I am happy I love going out with friends and doing stuff and I will enjoy myself and when I am neither then I just think whatever about the situation. Idk if this is counts as depression or not.I have been like this most of my life and have not talked to anyone about it really. Like a therapist or anything Do you have to be sad all the time to be 'depressed',Depression
23676,23696,Hello everyone! Long story short I downloaded a friend finding app and found someone who seems cool to hang out with based on their description. We talked once via voice chat for about an hour. They revealed to me they have depression. I am a bit confused because the person told me we could hang out sometime but whenever I message them I get no response at all. My social anxiety kicked in and I cannot tell if the person just does not care about being friends or if they are going through a rough time and messaging someone right now is too much for them. They posted themselves crying not too long ago but my social anxiety makes me think that they just do not want to talk to me and only said we should hang out last time to appeae nice.If they constantly post to social media but will not answer messages that definitely means they are not interested or does that mean they may be going through a difficult time? I want to become friends with someone going through depression advice?,Depression

23729,23749,everything is awful. I am so tired i cannot even explain how fucking awful it is. I am so tired,Depression
23744,23764,My life has pretty much been a downward spiral for 9 years now ever since I permanently injured my right shoulder in gymnasium European equivalent of high school.The injury is what started it all but as time passed my depression gradually grew into what it is today in the beginning it was only negative thoughts about my injury but as time passed and the negative thoughts got worse they started seeping into every aspect of my life until negative downright self deprecating thoughts became the norm.I no longer feel like I am actually living my life it feels like I am just going through the motions most days I just feel numb and I cannot remember what it is like to wake up and be excited about the day ahead. But just to be clear I have accepted that I do not have it in me to kill myself but if I am going to continue living I do not want to continue down the self destructive path I am on. As for the lying part. As of writing this I am completely broke on the verge of being kicked out of my apartment and I was kicked out of my university for inactivity 2 months ago and after having studied for 4 years I am actually happy that I do not have to study anymore since enrolling was just a thing I did mainly to have a community to be a part of but it did not help me and the stress of constantly studying just added to it all.My family do not know any of this and I have been too scared to tell them all this but now I have reached a point where I do not care anymore and am actually considering telling them about it all. Also because they keep asking me about my studies and my life in general and I just cannot keep lying about it anymore I cannot keep track of the lies and it is tearing me apart that this is what my life has become. I am mainly considering telling them because I have come to the conclusion that I cannot get out of this myself and that I need help. No matter what plans I make to lessen the feeling of hopelessness they all amount to nothing as the crushing hopelessness of it all makes it hard to must any energy to do anything but just drift along with whatever happens.I am not someone who usually discusses my feelings or emotional state with people so any advice is much appreciated. I am considering just telling my family about my depression so I do not have to lie about my life anymore.,Depression
23755,23775,I need to decide which games I am going to refund.. if you like what I bought please tell me so I know.

23773,23793,Two weeks after the kickout notification.I lost in the 'endgame'. My professor refused my days of begging and the kickout is confirmed. Now I am going to be detained in the military service hell for having that fckin dck. Just should had the hormone therapy and testicle removal surgery but I could not.Everything in my future is seasoned with shit. No positive factors anymore in my life. One more step and then I am over. I lost every single hope. I want to die.,Depression
23774,23794,The level of self delusion that exists within humans is breathtaking. As in I literally need to force myself to breathe when interacting with the astoundingly average individuals that aspire to positions of authority.exercise reduces anxiety no you bumbling baffoon exercise reduces stress. Anxiety is a complex neurological condition that requires synaptic rewiring to reduce . When anxiety binds one to bed for two weeks straight because the emotional overwhelm at the mere thought of having to interact a world designed to destroy the last remnants of my sanity then going for a walk becomes a much greater ordeal than your privileged pigheaded personage can possibly predict.How the fuck did such mediocre minds earn the right to dictate and define what passes for passable knowledge?Why is the ego of a professor is worth more than the wealth of knowledge the discovery of new ideas the challenge of defending the old ways of thinking in the light of new information? Madness.The most galling part is the history of humanity is literally littered with these same mistakes. Doctors now wash their hands because of a colleague who they had committed to an asylum because his notions were too absurd to be worth more than mockery. By what right does this tradition of abject arrogance continue? Why must we destroy those simply trying to prevent destruction? Fuck people. Fuck society. Fuck every corruption inflicted upon this world by the ignorant and greedy.God let me be at peace. Please. I have had enough of this. I do not belong here. it is 4am and I cannot hold back the maelstrom of vitriol that is whirling around my being.,Depression
23785,23805,Title is pretty self explanatory I keep telling my friend that I cannot hang out when in reality I just cannot get out of my room or shower I cannot freaking talk to people it is so hard and I cannot understand why such simple things are so monstrously difficult. I have not seen her in weeks and she is leaving to summer camp tomorrow and I feel so fucking bad that I keep having to tell her I cannot. I physically cannot make an effort to be presentable and social and my friend is frustratedupset that I cannot hang out because I keep making excuses,Depression
23798,23818,Does anyone feel kind of bad and invalidated when people say that they noticed that your depression got better but in reality you just stopped opening up and struggling on your own because when you did show symptoms they got angry and tired of dealing with it. Am I getting better if instead of crying I turned to numbness? If I was given the chance to self destruct without hurting anyone and having terrible consequences I would do it in a second. They say my Depression is getting better?,Depression
23802,23822,I have a lot of people on my life some of them friends family a love one and I cannot help but feeling alone all the time. I cannot trust anyone not even my own family and I cannot help but to keep things at my own. I have tried to open up and talk about stuff going tru my head but I feel like they do not care and that hurts a lot. Its feels like my Friends are moving far away out of me and that the new people I met are only there for a short moment of time and that in any moment they will leave. My family does not get me on that topic so I do not even try to explain it anymore. Tbh I am so done with life that I do not call living anymore I am just waiting while time passes I am alone even when I jave company,Depression
23820,23840,I am sure I will get you are too young to be posting here or something like that but I have not been feeling great for a long time now. I do not exactly have no friends but I am nobody's beat friend. I feel as if I am just there and nobody cares about me. Nobody talks to me. Also school is too painful for me it is just an 8 hour day of stress sadness and suffering. I am doing horribly in school and feel as if my life will go to crap at 18 or something worse could happen before then. Ever since I went to secondary school I feel as if I lost everyone that actually cared about me from primary school. I no longer have the energy to do what I want I do not eat enough barely get any sleep and just feel sad all the time. I stress way too much and I recently lost a friend because they did not believe that I was depressed. I am not sure about anything anymore. Sometimes I feel like I should jump in front of a car would probably make everyone is lifes easier. Obviously this probably is not too big of a deal and I am just overthinking it but I am not sure. 1st time posting here and already feel nervous to press post. I am 14 have not felt happiness in a while.,Depression
23829,23849,and I cannot take it anymore. I hate that I am feeling this way given that I have been lucky enough to get a good job in this climate but everyday I get home and breakdown crying.how am i supposed to spend the rest of my life like this? feels like i should give a welldeserving person this job and just die 2 months into my first real job after graduating with a degree,Depression
23850,23870,When I was 15 years old I 21 year old man from my church. He was one of the youth group volunteers and therefore I did not find it odd when he started reaching out to me online. It seemed he was worried about me as an adult and I thought he was trying to sort of guide me into the right path. He would constantly tell me how smart and how beautiful I was. When I was 16 he and I started messaging every day. He would ask about school and ask about my parents. I would complain to him about my parents and instead of giving real advice he would feed into it. Yeah they do not understand you while making it clear that HE understood me. He made me feel so important and so special. By the time I turned 17 and he was 24 we were in CONSTANT contact. We would message all day while I was at school and then when I got home. I did not do homework and I stayed up til 3 on some nights just chatting with him. When I got my license he began making sexual advances. At first I tried to keep him away but I wanted to be wanted so badly. He told me that we were supposed to be together. He told me he loved me and he told me I was perfect. He would have me tell my parents I was sleeping at a friends house but I would be sleeping at his house instead. One time he convinced me to try alcohol telling me It will taste like candy. When I did not like it he tried to get me to drink the whole things but I would not. He was genuinely obsessed with me. He admitted that he was keeping boys my age away from me whenever he could when I was 15 and 16 years old. He told me that he was always looking at my social media including what I watched and commented on Youtube. There were a couple times I tried to break things off with him but he just would not let go. This went on and off for 6 years until it finally ended for real. I was 23....and I realized that I was around his age when he started things physically with me as a Jr. in high school. I pictured myself with a high school Jr. of 17 years old and I felt sick to my stomach. It messed me up really badly. I did not know what a healthy relationship was. I never really progressed emotionally the way I was supposed to like I was constantly just stuck at 17 years old. I wanted him in jail. He BELONGS in jail....only he does not. 34 states the age of consent is 16 including my own. It is LEGAL for an adult of ANY age to have sex with a 16 year old high school SOPHOMOR! In most states you can even have sex with an actual child...as long as you get married. Guess what? it is LEGAL to marry a child in those same states as long as you get parental consent WHICH PARENTS GIVE ALL THE TIME. This is literally happening in the United States and it is just fine with everyone. I am messed up forever going to trauma therapy and our government is telling me that nothing bad happened to me. Because at that age I was considered to be equipped to handle a grown man feeding me alcohol telling me he was in love with me and promising me that he was going to solve all my problems. The same age girls were all obsessed with Twilight and learning how to drive. I was not old enough to buy cigarettes or alcohol or voted....but I could have sex with adults. do not get me wrong I do not think I SHOULD have been allowed to buy cigarettes or alcohol or vote....but HE should not have been allowed to do the things he did to me. I feel like I am going to vomit. I hate this world. I just want this world to change,Depression
23861,23881,I have suffered from depression for over 10 years now as well as cptsd due to my mothers abuse. I am also autistic and queer I suffer from chronic pain and I am poor despite working 60 hours a week on call but when you are basically an informal area manager with lowlevel employee pay....I was seeing a psychiatrist for 10 years but I never really told him anything substantial because my mother was also his patient and even with HIPAA I felt that she could easily learn things about me I needed her not to know. I finally cut her out of my life but to do so I had to move 6 hours away from all of my family and friends and I could not afford to see the psych anymore. I could not even afford health insurance. Due to that I have been unmedicated and out of therapy for 5 or so years now.Now I am more financially stable and looking for a psych andor therapist to help me process my trauma and help me to be a functioning member of society. I have reached out to 6 different people and only one agreed to see me with one of them even explicitly denying me because were a system. However all she did was push anxiety apps and meditation at me then she forgot about me after two months of seeing her.I feel like were untreatable. This is never going to get better. I have not self harmed in a few years and have not seriously considered suicide in even longer but now those thoughts are coming back. I have been bursting into tears for no reason at least 10 times a day and I am plagued by nightmares about my mother finding me. Yesterday my grandma who partially raised me begged me to call my mom and I snapped at her and today I found out she is in the hospital. Things are only getting worse. I do not want to die but I do not know what else to do. My spouse does not know how to support me and my only IRL friend is having her own problems. I am stuck on a steady decline. Considering relapse or worse at this point,Depression
23863,23883,I have not made it into work the last 2 days I work for the NHS and I feel at rock bottom. My boyfriend is supposed to be coming up to mine tonight but I do not even want to see him. I want to curl up into a ball and go to sleep for a very long time. I feel like I am lying to everyone. do not want to be here anymore Really struggling today,Depression

23953,23973,I am sure that people have been through much more than I am right now. However this currently is about me and my not being able to handle the situation. I will try to list out my life just because I want to share them with someone.I am a young guy 26 years of age in a dead end IT job. Over the last 2 years I have gained huge amount of weight and I feel like shit because of my body. The pandemic has been a tough time for me personally. I have not been able to handle the pandemic and have relapsed to alcohol and overeating.So below are the stressors of my life1. Being a IT worker I sit around all day swamped with work. My work involves client interactions and while I try to be polite today I just broke down. The job is the biggest stressor. I spend 12 hours a day working and interacting with very rude people. 2. I need to lose weight. I have connected with a personal diet coach. However I am not able to follow through with the steps she wants me to take. I feel so disappointed with myself because of it.3. Being in this dead end job will be very harmful for my career. I need to study and change to a different portfolio within IT. I take interviews regularly. Yesterday I was lined up for a dream job. I felt prepared after having spent many months reviewing and learning all of the required concepts. Sadly I was rejected. 4. I have a decent salary but I have friends who do not respect money. Most of my money goes to bailing them out from their financial disasters. In the end I feel like I am losing money all the time. My own financial position is not something to be proud of. I have no money saved up for emergency or if I end up losing my job.I feel I have too much on my plate sometimes and I cannot do all of this at once. I have been failing to make progress on any of the problems for the past 2 years and I feel depressed due to this fact. Solution to all my problems is taking action but I cannot do what is needed,Depression
23959,23979,Pretty much as the title says I do not want to live alone. I am dependent on my boyfriend on many things. I cannot picture myself alone without him. I told him that today and it freaked him out. I am already a depressive person. I do not know if I am thrilled to live the rest is my life alone I just told my boyfriend when he dies I will follow him.,Depression
23992,24012,My little brother has been and will always be my world. He grew up privileged with two loving parents who did everything for him. I grew up with the same parents. My mom and I no longer get along but we used to be very close. My dad was emotional verbally and physically abusive towards me all throughout my teen years. My brother told me I should not talk about it to people because it tarnished my parents name. That they took care of me fed me clothes me took me on vacation. While I recognize my father feels guilty for how he treated me he has NEVER apologized and has not made any effort to be in my life. I do not see why I need to protect someone who never really protected me. I feel like once again I am being considered as overemotional and that my feelings pain or my experience is not valid. Yes my father is not the same person but that does not change my nightmares about him nor my PTSD. Today is the first night in a while I felt worthless And did not want to fight any longer. I have my loving husband in my corner but that is it. I love so deeply. Why cannot others love me. One person I never expected,Depression
24005,24025,Started a 95 a few days ago that is an engineering placement for my university degree. The only thing is I have quickly realised that I cannot sit at a desk for 8 hours a day and actually just want to cry whenever I get home thinking I have got to go back there the next day. The work environment is really quiet so there is not really much interaction with others and I have just been sat at a desk for 8 hours everyday with my thoughts.I cannot cope with thinking this is my life for the next year waking up at 630am getting ready going to work for 8 hours which is boring and soul sucking then going home and not being able to do anythingenjoy anything because I am dreading coming to work the next day. Its only been three days but I cannot wait for this year to end. I may have the option to stop the placement but that will not stand good with the company or university I feel that working 8 hours a day is wasting my life and thinking I am going to be doing this for the rest of my life makes me just fall down this hole of thinking I have made the wrong choices in life in terms of career path. Started a 95 I cannot cope,Depression
24023,24043,I do not know what to do anymore I have already spent alot of money for treatments and check ups doctors does not seem to know what is going on lol nothing seems to cure me i cannot even keep up with my job anymore because of my illness and also my relationship with my so is going thru a rough patch because i feel like a burden and sometimes i break up with him because i want him to live life happily not with me which is miserable but he still stays despite the consequences that i told him it cannot be helped until I am cured it is so hard no one even understands my pain sometimes i just want to consider suicide but I do not want to be selfish My undiagnosed chronic illness and miserable life,Depression

24097,24117,I feel like shit. I am shit. I constantly feel like shit and I hate everything. Wtf is this. Why do I exist? what is the reason behind all of this? I feel like shit and that is because I am shit. Pls do not care about a worthless useless piece of shit like me. I do not deserve anything good. I need to die Yes I am,Depression
24098,24118,Its painful waking up every morning acting like everythings alright. I just want to cry! I am sick of dealing with life ,Depression
24169,24189,I can staunch some of the pain by being outside during the day but when the darkness comes there is no escape. No choice but to sit in my room and be reminded about every single mistake fuck up and how horrible I have treated myself and others. cannot crawl into bed and sleep comfortable with my body in shambles from neglect both physical and mental. it is just pure pain when the sun sets Nights are the worst...,Depression
24188,24208,I lack a support system. My mom is dead. My father lives over a thousand miles away and does not care about me. My ex gf left months ago. I now have limitedno friends. Okay now my sad story is over. I do not know what to do. I thought making money and working hard would make me happy and make the people around me happy. Hint it does not. I guess I am lonely. I want to have someone in my life that will talk to me and care about me. I want to care about them. I guess I want to have a purpose or someone to share life with. Today I watched the sunset. I wish I had someone to share that with. I start to think the world is better without me and what is the point? All I have now is my career. I admit I probably pushed others away or did not understand their problems. Now I am alone. Now I am sad. I fear I am becoming depressed Male 26,Depression
24277,24297,do not go back into that place again its not worth the pain. people may always try to bring you down but there is always hands to bring you back up from that hole. its not worth the energy going back keep striving forward. you will have people asking if your ok only keep those people at arms length. your true people that know you and care for you will always know when your not ok. they will always listen and try to take your mind away from those people that only just pretend.sometimes it will be you just one against those people that will use your energy and twist it. they know your struggling but will not come near you to put that arm round and hear you. you see these people on a daily do not let the fakr sincerety or smiles sway you. they are only there to distract you from that positive energy. no matter how much you try they will not.always stop for the those that take there time to understand you know when that pain and black cloud is there. these people will be your family. some people will hear your jokes and think your happy but not understand the pain behind it. family wilp aleays hear your jokes and see through. stop putting on that smile for everyone be honest.the truth hurts the softest ears but cannot offend the strongest. never be afraid to be honest! silence is definitely golden. show the effort that people put in to youn Struggling not to go backwards,Depression
24295,24315,Have you ever went against something you have been saying for a long time? It feels like I am telling myself lies. Just recently I started watching videos about biology and deformations in the human body. These videos showed real dissections of human bodies. It sank in like really hard harder than it has before. We will all die. This laptop that I am typing on means nothing every hello or greeting I say will mean nothing. I will be a pile of ash or bones in a coffin or vase. Flies will eat away at my rotting flesh worms will bit by bit eat my bones. I am not even going to war. I tried searching for when we will be immortal and no answers came up. I am trying so hard to not die but at times I tell myself that I should lay down AND die. I have tried to focus on other things I tried watching meme comps on youtube. I tried listening to music and going outside. I wanted to get caught up on life residuals I wanted to see the beauty of nature to heal and cope. But it is chaotic at least humanity is. You do not see other animals doing what we do. So many of us have different experiences and memories. There are things I want to experience for myself. but will not be able to within whatever time I have left. The worst part is I think my life span has decreased I inhale at least 32mg of weed I do not smoke but I hang with people who do smoke. I am fat I weigh in at 197 pounds I have no real friends and that is shown to decrease lifespans. I am honestly concerned about my health I cannot look at the sky anymore without thinking of death I will not be able to see clouds anymore. I am afraid of my own mortality and the cycle. How do I cope?,Depression
24298,24318,I am looking for ideas to raise depression amp anxiety awareness amp some ideas to let other peers know they are not alone? As far as myself dealing with depression and anxiety is rough. IDEAS amp Opinions,Depression
24301,24321, so you are telling me it is a solution ! My reaction to suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem will always be the same.,Depression
24306,24326,I am officially done being nice. From now on I am going to to be an asshole jerk selfish and I am not going to help others if I do not want to care about others or do the things I do not want to anymore. I used to think that being nice was the way to like correctly but oh boi was I wrong. People are assholes and they live better than I do and they seem to be carefree so now I will do the same. Being a good guy has literally gotten me nowhere In life I thought I would have much more to show by now but nope.I guess I will see how this goes cannot really go anymore downhill from here. Being kind caring compassionate and a nice person has gotten me nowhere,Depression
24333,24353,I will admit idk what the fuck is wrong with me. Ever since I was young I have had the thought of killing myself. I have never had any motivation or sense of purpose for anything good. My thought process for years now has been that it is my destiny to kill myself. I am 22 now and I am about to fail university I have got no life skills for the working world so I am not prepared for life. Tbh I am not a hard worker either. I have never had anything to complain about I do not live a bad life all my issues are my own and are caused by me. I am extremely jealous of others and I am constantly ashamed of myself for not being good enough. The truth is some people are destined to be great people with amazing talents. Other people like me a destined to be lazy and waste their life until they decide to kill themselves. So that is what I am going to do because nothing will change the fact that deep down all I am is a lazy piece of shit who is full of hate and I cannot be arsed with anything anymore. I am just tired of living as a human I hate being conscious I cannot fucking handel it anymore. Do you know what it is like to constantly be thinking of suicide your entire life everyday do you know how much that shapes your every choice because you believe every year will be your last? To look in the mirror everyday and see nothing but a failure? It sends me fucking crazy because one second I can appreciate how beautiful life is then the next all I can think about it killing myself. It sends me crazy because I am so angry with myself for not being stronger and just changing myself. I wish my stupid fucking parents could of kept it in their trousers. I feel like I am mentally prepping for my suicide,Depression
24347,24367,Hi everyone. I am an 18 year old Male and I have been depressed ever for about 5 years. For the longest time I have been captive to suffering in silence. But I cannot keep it in anymore. I need help and I am fucking terrified to admit it. My depression has been getting steadily worse for a year. I have been close to ending it all many times I feel like I am drowning but every day I put on my smile and act like nothing is going on.I cannot keep doing this. But I do not know how to tell my family how I feel. I hardly know how to talk to anyone anymore. I could really use some advice from those of you who have been in my shoes talked to someone and got help. Thank you all in advance. I am considering opening up to my family I need pointers.,Depression

24367,24387,I am a 22 year old depressed trust fund kid who does not have a job but is in college. I do not work because I hate all the jobs I have tried multiple places already and have so much job experience. Any recommendations of part time jobs for a college student that might make me happier and less of a loser I am in college because I want to be educated and it costs me nothing to become educated also I am depressed because all I do is stay home with no social life whatsoever 22 and depressed,Depression
24378,24398,I am depressed I am circumcised and angry my parents did it. I want to talk to them about it but do not have the courage.I am restoring my foreskin which helps but it is fucking stupid I have to do that. Why could not I have all the parts I was born with that were a part of MY body until someone mutilated me for no reason?I am 24 and should be focusing on life but I am too fucking distracted with the fact that I am genitally mutilated and everyone tells me I should be thankful and nobody gives a shit about how I feel. Fuck my parents who did this to me and fuck the doctor who did it.The only person who listens is my wife but I can tell she does not want to keep hearing about how I am depressed about it and it makes me feel like a burden.it is the one thing that makes me fucking hate my country. Fuck everyone who has ever done this to their kids and fuck society for making it okay. Anyone who is okay with it is a piece of shit and should burn in hell. Depressed I am circumcised,Depression
24415,24435, let us make a Wikipedia page for PSSD!,Depression
24461,24481,Fuck it. I am tired of you shitheads talking me that I need to put in to w work. Its to much and it does not do anything in the end. I cannot stick to it consistently so it is pointless. I am done with this fucking bullshit. If you actually get runners high you are a pathetic foodie twoshoes light weight. I have run three half marathons and trained for each. The only thing I had akin to runners high was this oleasure I got after collapsing at the finish line insanely exhausted. That ONLY happened the firsty time and it was not worth it because it hurt like hell and it only happened bacuase I did not train well for the run so it never happened again. Besides that excercise is a fucking chore and you are a brain dead hulk if standing and lifting weights cures your existential depression. Fuck you shithead. Fuck hard work,Depression
24479,24499,I am struggling with my life lately. Especially financially because I am unable to afford my car that I have been paying for years. I had moved because the job I was doing was taking for much from me mentally I was working with mentally disabled and working 17 hours shifts no breaks. We stayed in they homes with them. The pay was basic and I was able to pay bills.But I moved and was living off the stimulus checks when I lost the job I moved here for. I have got 2 part time jobs that will only be able to pay my housing and a little more. But I would not able to afford the car.it is hard enough to leave the house to go to work when all I want to do is just lay in bed and let the world go on. I have no one that can help and my friend does not understand depression at all and tells me I need to just get over it and work more hours or find a better job. I do not live in a big city like they do. Opportunities do not overfloweth here.I have tried looking into ways of getting a different car but when your credit is bad it is almost impossible. Anyways this was basically just a rant. Any advice or help would be nice though. Struggling,Depression
24483,24503,All I want to do now is make my depression and anxiety worse to a point that I Kms do not know what to do? I want to actively make my depression and anxiety worse,Depression
24490,24510,I have been alone for a long time. do not have any siblings or extended family just my mom and dad. Everyone else is dead or out of my life. I think during my childhood was the only time I ever had real friends around me that genuinely cared. But when I was 11 we moved to a brand new country so I had to leave all of those friendships behind. I have not been able to make a single genuine bond since just some friends you joke around with sometimes hang out grab drinks. I put friends in quotation marks because none of them really care all that much. They never ask how I am say they missed me or show interest in me or my life in general. And I am pretty sure if I went missing today they would not even notice.Anyway I stay at a flat with 6 other people. Amongst them is a girl around my age. I was too shy to ever go up and talk to her but I have always found her very attractive. One day she came up to me and added me to a group chat where we could organise stuff to do with all the other flatmates or just talk about things in general or complain when someone did not wash their dishes or something.Anyway it slowly blossomed into a friendship between me and her. We understood each other we got along we talked we even started relying on each other for emotional support sometimes. It got to the point where she would come to my room almost every day and we would just talk about anything stay up all night and watch movies. She bowled her eyes out next to me watching Princess Kaguya. It was great. For a while I completely forgot that I was alone. She started becoming the person I looked forward to seeing. She filled that gap for me. I guess as a result of that it was inevitable that this infatuation would turn into romantic interest on my end. But she did not return my feelings and now she is seeing someone else. I tried to be respectful about it I told her that I would probably find it a bit hard to stay friends and I do not feel bad for saying that as it is the honest truth and I have been distancing myself to give her space.But now I am alone again. Her life is going on like nothing ever happened because she never needed me in the first place. I was the one that needed her. I keep checking my phone every day thinking maybe she will reach out to me eventually maybe our friendship did mean more to her and she misses me. But every day that goes by confirms to that it is not true. So now I am alone. Being alone before sucked. It was painful. But I was also used to it it is all I knew so I learned to cope. Now that I have had a taste of what real friendship what love feels like. I cannot go back anymore. It hurts too much.it is impacting every aspect of my life. I am not eating properly. I stopped going to work. I am not finding fun or enjoyment in the things I used to. I do not know what to do or how much longer I can go on.I just wish my family did not love me so much. Then there would be nothing stopping me nobody I would hurt by ending it all So tired if being alone,Depression
24526,24546,Never imagined I would be crying my eyes out frustrated with my life in my late 20s. I just feel so tired to even type this up.Career no job money socializing personality anxiety insecurities speechblocks selfconscious seasonal confidence have the potential but too inept to even try feelings of hopelessness phone anxiety unable to be independentIt's all killing me. Why does it have to be me when everyone is continuing with the routine. I am tired of convincing myself with 'they may seem to have it all but they may not actually have it' hell I am left with so much to worry about that I cannot even think beyond my worries. I have to pretend that I am ok masking all my feelings and emotions when in reality my mind is like a sleeping volcano awaiting to erupt.My school life ruined my whole life. Why me,Depression
24573,24593,but what is the use if my mental health does not? i still would not be able to appreciate and revel in the beauty of life.no matter how great my situation is my mind is still in the same state as it was when things were at their worst. if only i could be like a robot with no thoughts my brain will not overcomplicate things for no reason and i would only live to be productive. things will get better,Depression
24607,24627,I am not exactly sure where to ask that. If there is a better subreddit for it let me know it and I will go there. Here is the story.I began to be in depression at aroud 12 for no specific reason that I can recall. At 17 I try to strangulate myself to death during my sleep. At 18 I tried to asphyxiate myself in a car. Nobody noticed it. At 20 I shot myself in the mouth with a 22 long rifle. It was harder to hide so family and friend finally knew it. I was incredibly lucky since I was not paralysed or disfigured and had very little sequels. This I can understand it is biology and a huge amount of luck. What I cannot seem to explain though is that since then I am not depressed anymore and it is been 15 years. I had my up and downs depending on my life situation of course but not the dark thoughts everyday that nothing could make disappear. So does anybody has a theory on why I am not depressed anymore ? it is just curiosity and nothing will change if I find an answer but I did not manage to by myself in those 15 years. Thanks. And to be clear I know I was incredibly lucky both mentally and physically and of course I would never ever suggest a suicide attempt to end depression. I was depressed. Tried to kill myself. Was not depressed anymore. Why ?,Depression
24623,24643,Title says it all. No one cares. I passed out at work yesterday while I was punching out after working 10 hours in sweltering heat. No one from work has reached out to see how I am feeling today.,Depression
24707,24727,I have recently been going through a very rough patch after months of being okay. I know I am slipping back to where I was a year ago. The only difference is that I have friends now. I told them about my depression and how I am going through another rough patch now which was why I took a one day break from school. One of them told a group of people about the fact that I am absent because I am mentally unwell. The other 2 told another person about it when they asked. I do not even know if I should be angry that they told these people without my permission or just very disappointed in myself that I did not see this coming and showed signs of weakness. I just wished they respected that what I told them is private information that should not be shared. That should be a default thing understood by everyone when someone opens up about mental health privately to you. I wish people respected boundaries,Depression
24712,24732,i have been depressed for most of my life and my parents thought they finally got rid of it. i have been on antidepressants for like 2 years and it seemed to help. but now i have been letting the metaphorical shit hit my fan so everything has gone back to square one. I am afraid that if my mom finds out she will feel bad for me and will be really upset and i do not want that to happen. i cannot even cry or express my feelings cuz the last time i get really upset i said id burn the house down and now my dad thinks I am a pyromaniac so fuck my life. but lol actually the real reason i do not care about anyone but myself is because she may put me in the mental hospital that they put me in last time i was suicidal.but that place is no hospitalthey make you explain what heinous act you committed to get here every 10 minutes and not only is it triggering to hear that other people in the room hurt themselves but that it forces me to strategize my responce to their questions like instead of i threatened to smack my head against the wall and to kill myself i slowly change my respawnse to i am just really sad all the timei hate that when my dad yells i just have to force myself to not cry and feel all this pain in my chest instead. i hate the fact that i have to hide my depression from my parents,Depression
24727,24747,I really do not know how normal people do it anymore. It feels so shit. Going a few days feeling fine and feeling happy and being able to sleep and not having shitty thoughts. But it all comes back always. The realisation of how mentally unhealthy I am really sucks. I cannot wait to just get over this. So crazy how I manage to continually convince myself I am not depressed,Depression
24750,24770,But the only alternative is living and I do not want that either. I do not want to die,Depression
24779,24799,Its just I cannot hurt myself but I do not want to live anymore. Is there a way to find someone to kill me?,Depression
24788,24808,I do not even know why I am writing this. I just think that I cannot talk about this things without alarming o worry the people in my life. I do not want to feel like this anymore everyday from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed I feel like absolute shitSometimes when I am out with friends I feel a little relieved and when I am with my boyfriend my mood is generally better but firstly we are in a long distance relationship so we cannot see each other every day and secondly I cannot count entirely on somebody else to be happy. I have suicidal thoughts everyday multiple times a day but I struggle to talk about this because even if I am almost sure that I will never act on it because I have hope that someday I will be if not okay al least better I cannot convince others of that. I feel like I am slowing becoming more and more difficult to be with I am terrified of that. They always say a good friendboyfriend does not leave you just because you are struggling but it happened to me before how can I ignore that? I do not want to be a burden. All I want is to be happy or at least stable and to be a source of happiness to others. Sometimes I feel the need to ignore everyone to not drag them in the depression pit with me because there are days when I really cannot control myself and suppress what I am feeling and i KNOW that it affects others. What can I do to make things better? I just cannot do this anymore I am exhausted,Depression
24790,24810,Hey fam! I play in a band that is going to put out a track about the reality of depressionsuicide and how it affects the people you leave behind.

24804,24824,When I am depressed I stay silent. Unless there is a very good reason to talk I keep my thoughts to myself and even when I do speak its in as few words as possible. I give nothing away. When I am angry I have focus and drive and I do not take shit from anyone in fact I actively punish people who fuck with me. I do not do anything I do not want to do and do not give a shit what people think of me because I do not need them for anything.I like myself in both of those states. I keep to myself and I never end up regretting the things I say or do. But when I am happy its like I am a different person. I hate that person. I get self conscious and make concessions for other people as a result I overshare and tell people things Id never want them to know about me and immediately regret it every time I just lose all the things about myself I have learned to do right over the years all the things I actually like about myself. Its like having my brain hijacked.And people who see my like that get fooled into thinking that is who I actually am and they expect it all the time even though most of the time that is not me at all and I do not even understand that person. And because I am not me at those times I guess I make people think I actually want friends and then they get confused and blame me when I do not want to hang out and I secretly just want them to fuck off which I guess is my fault.I just hate being happy I hate who I become and I wish I could somehow guarantee Id never turn into that person ever again. I hate myself when I am happy,Depression
24856,24876,What can I say? I did not get the job offer that I did two interviews for and I just feel a sense of loneliness tonight. I do not know what to do or who to talk to. I was doing so good a couple of weeks back. I felt as though I was beating my mental illness but they are back in full swing. I was going to bed early eating small things for breakfast. But just like that it went downhill over the weekend. I just feel as though its just going to get worse. I Feel Awful Today,Depression
24858,24878,I really need to express some thoughts to somebody Can someone talk to me for a minute?,Depression
24878,24898,Ever since I fell into this depressive episode I cannot handle any responsibility no matter how small or how important it is. I keep my phone on airplane mode all day so no one asks me to come and do anything. I have not reapplied for university courses because I cannot fathom how I am going to handle that if going to the grocery store gives me huge anxiety that I cannot handle so I just do not go. I literally sit in the same seat in the park for 16 hours each day with a bag of chips and a bottle of water just waiting for the day to end. I used to be highly motivated with multiple hobbies and going through Engineering school. Now I have lost all that and even worse I have lost myself. cannot bare responsibility anymore,Depression
24897,24917,I have tried a couple different SSRI medications doses since october. i still have intense amp lengthy episodes of depression amp occasional mania. I am feeling my self destructive urges amp suicidal tendencies coming back. just moved crosscountry into an RV and am currently looking into getting help amp possible diagnoses for other mental issues. i feel really out of place alone stagnant and unwanted by almost everyone in my life. i also think that i really need to take a break from the internet and find myself and focus on getting better. especially because the people i talk with online seem far less invested in me than i was with them. it hurts. anyways I am going to try and do that. wish me luck. and best of luck to all of you out there dealing with similar things. you are not alone you are heard felt understood and loved. thank you amp best of wishes to you all. taking a break,Depression
24909,24929,I am feeling like there is no hope in my life. Everything is just bland and worthless. No one loves me. I really want to die.that is why I wrote this song.Yesterday I failed my suicide attempt but I regretted the moment I felt very close to death.that is why I wrote this song.I still want to live just not this life.So even if no one reads this I wrote this song....Somewhere thereSomewhere thereI know that there is a placeSomewhere thereWhere I am no longer replacedSomewhere thereTheres a castle made of sweetSomewhere thereI can live inside my dreamsSomewhere thereThere are no cuts on my armsSomewhere thereThey cannot do me any harmSomewhere thereMy depression is all goneSomewhere thereI am no longer aloneSomewhere thereTheres still love inside their heartsSomewhere thereI do not have to live this farceSomewhere thereI knew that I could surviveSomewhere thereI still want to be aliveSomewhere thereSomewhere there I wrote a song,Depression
24932,24952,Well. Like 1 and a half year ago I met a girl from my classroom. As the lonely person as I am I obviously feel in love with her really hard because you know when no one is nice to you after many time. When finally someone is nice to you you think that person really care. Anyway we became friends after she got a boyfriend I never told her what I felt for her. Well we still being friends also we are more closer friends. And about 2 months ago we got more busy and we focused in our stuff and we get a little distant in that two months ee only talked like 10 times which is very few considering that we used to talk every day.Then 3 weeks ago I met another girl we started talking and there is good friendship growing between us and I thought I was better because even when she is nice with me and all. I did not feel any kind 'romantic' feeling or something as I felt with my other friend let us name my old friend V and my new friend K. And I thought I jave already overcame V and I was not in love with her anymore I was very shure.And well some days ago we made a videocall after more than 3 weeks without any interaction between us. And when I saw her V I felt weird again and I think I fell in love with her again or maybe I never stopped being in love with her. Idk. I saw her cute face and those beautiful green eyes and I could not do anything to not fell something for her again.The problem here is that V has a boyfriend she do not like me in that way and I thought I was very good being her friend. I thought I had already finished with that feelings to her. I am confused. Why I still like her? I do not want to be tied to her always. I promised I will not interfere in her life in that way.The growing friendship with K made me thought that I was good again and I could let V 'go' if I wanted. But I dot know why I still like her. This is confusing and I am afraid I start acting like a dumb with any of them. I just want peace I have many other problems to worry about this is not helping me with my depression. And also if these means I really really like V. The situation would be very shitty for me because she has a boyfriend and I have no chance with her. I know I would never achieve something with her I am not her kind. And my mind is tricking me again making fake scenarios where V is involved and I do not even notice when it happens. This is shitty. I thought this would never because me problems again,Depression
24961,24981,While depressed did people notice when you were isolating yourself? What did they say or do? I recently just got out of a severely depressive episode. I am 'back' now. I have started to talk to friends again. But I am curious to know what other people's experiences have been like meeting up with a loved one after so long. I hung out with a friend today that I missed so much. Talking to friends and family again after self isolation,Depression
25012,25032,I have never felt so low in my life. I wish there was an easy way to kill myself like just falling asleep and then never waking up again. There are some parts of my life I think I would miss but I know everyone who loves me would move on and I would not have to feel like this anymore. I just feel sick of living. Always tired. I am just really tired. Off Button,Depression

25045,25065,There is not anything interesting about it it is so boring and meaningless most humans suck. Life is not worth living,Depression
25137,25157,Long story short I have been chronically ill and depressed for 17 years. I have never claimed disability even though I was probably eligible for it. I have worked on and off over my life but had long periods of unemployment due to health issues.4 years ago I returned home to my parents after living away for a few years and life fell apart. I had been home for about 6 months and my mental health was rapidly declining. I had not worked I would finished a long term relationship I would come back from a very different life and and I was lost. I decided to claim universal creditjob seekers and get myself back on track. But my mum had had some inheritance money from my grandparents sitting in her account for many years and she decided to give it to me just before I claimed.I did not realise but there was a threshold for claiming that I now just exceeded literally by a few hundred pounds. And I was not eligible to claim because of it.I have now been at home for nearly 4 years. I have been in a living nightmare. My mental health has fallen apart and I have been at absolute rock bottom including regular suicidal thoughts and tendancies. I have not worked this whole time and barely do a thing. I have sought help for mental health but I had the most awful traumatising experience and had all my 17 years of chronic health conditions disputed and was told I was not depressed and just needed to take responsibility for my life. I was literally laughed out of the room after saying I was very close to suicide especially on one occasion. I am now 37 and have thrown away the last part of my youth. I have been beyond utterly miserable and lost and ruined my and those around me's lives.It dawned on me again today that had my mum not given me that inheritance money right then I would have been able to claim universal credit and I would have been forced into getting a job and I would have been back on track. Instead my severe anxiety depression and health conditions stopped me from being able to make any decisions and I entered a bleak world of nothingness where I did nothing but sit in a world contemplating the pointlessness of existence wailing myself to sleep in absolute desperation and feeling like the most worthless piece of meat ever to exist. Why did I just not give the money back and claim again. It would have forced me into a world of normality and I would not be where I am.I simply cannot take it and every day is a nightmare. Nothing seems worth it. I have no joy and everything seems pointless. I cannot believe what I have put myself and my family through. I do not think I can ever get over this and I am still just as trapped and unable to move on in my life. I am balling my eyes out now and I wish I would never existed.Please I need some words of help. Having major anxiety at realisation and rumination from my past 4 years of miserably wasting my life lost and doing absolutely nothing. Need calming down please.,Depression
25169,25189,Hi all. I want finally recover from this shit. I have it already almost one year and I have enough. It becomes only worse.Can you give me some advice and tips how to recover?Maybe someone can recommend a good therapist?Do you have some good resources? Books? YouTube? Podcasts? Methods?I would be grateful for that. How can I recover?,Depression
25225,25245,I spend most of my time maladaptive daydreaming to the point where my evenings and nights are completely wasted and it takes me a while to get to sleep I used to look forward to going to bed after a stressful day just so I can escape. I have done some online tests and apparently I am not that extreme. Tough thing is it is mostly about a guy I have not spoken to in a year its hard to get over him when he takes up so much of my mental space. Maladaptive daydreaming,Depression
25318,25338,Background info Ever since I was young I was obsessed with this sport and would spend all day playing thinking about watching it etc. No matter what had happened it was my main purpose and my main source of happiness it wasis more or less my identity I have played and obsessed over improving since I was 8 years old Now 19 so 11 years of blood sweat and tears put in to get better and progress this is the main theme of this post.Back in 2018 I was diagnosed with depression and had counselling It did not work a big part of this was the feeling of unfulfilled potential in a certain sport this was from myself I was really happy with how I was progressing at 1415 yrs old and would spend hours of my day thinking and working to improve even marginally I was obsessed because of this I saw a huge jump in my ability and I went from good to very good for my age I then got complacent forgetting that I was not an especially gifted athlete in the traditional sense so I made up for it through drilling technique and working hard so while I made loads of progress I forgot that it was because of my hunger and not natural athleticism due to complacency I got lazy over the winter off season and started getting unfit due to eating crap foods not training anywhere near enough as I had before due to this I came back worse despite getting bigger and stronger due to puberty I regressed and suddenly felt a sense of worthlessness as I was not where I expected to be after a great previous season. I then fell into depression stopped caring about anything and even started to care about the sport less and less putting on loads of weight.I eventually got fit again and came back better than ever both mentally and physically I had then progressed even more and noticed a huge jump from the season before and I kept this hunger to improve through the off season winter just gone I worked even harder and kept myself in great shape hoping to progress even more I had the obsession back. Then I come back and get injured and I am not sure I will ever be able to play again and if I do I will not be anywhere near as good. Just as my life gained purpose again I get this and now I feel isolated and alone as I notice no signs of improvement. I feel terrible and now I know I am slipping back into depression with no outlet and focus I have nothing to look forward to and strive towards in my life and the worst part is that I had spent my whole life working hard and enjoying this putting in hours of work to get better and play at a higher standard and now that whole 11 years will be for nothing as I am not even going to be able to play past my teen years my whole identity has been stripped away and I am not sure what the hell I can do...TLDR I have just wasted 11 years of my life and now I have no passion or identity.P.S. Sorry for the long post I needed to ramble and appreciate it is not the most coherent writing. My whole life is quickly unravelling again this time I am worried I cannot come back,Depression
25326,25346,I was finally doing better and concentrating on my work and but of course I make a mistake or misunderstand an assignment plus there was a recent death in the family so I am just all over the place.And I just got some negative feedback from my boss and now I feel worthless and it will probably be on my upcoming performance evaluation and my entire day feels pointless. Why bother if I have already messed up?Anytime I start feeling good inevitably something happens to ruin it. what is the point? I keep messing up when I feel good,Depression
25337,25357,Can anyone tell me if heshe is finally making what makes himher happy? And what is that? And how did you managed to obtain this? It can be anything work related family related anything. I am feeling stuck for a long time now and I feel I am failing in any way. I am curious abot you. What makes you happy? Making what makes you happy,Depression
25369,25389,What you were doing to distract yourself today? Or how you spent day? Who played videogames? What games? I am going crazy little bit today and noone to talk to so thought about others what they did What you were doing today?,Depression

25400,25420,I fucking hate myself. I do not know myself at all. I cannot relate to anything. I am a stranger on the outside world even from myself. I want to die I cannot do this,Depression
25428,25448,Just to make it clear I am not going to divulge anything about me personally. I do not feel that comfortable I am really no looking for validation and I just someone to talk to that will not give me the most vapid and condensing answer. Will it help me? Obviously you do not know and I do not expect anyone to be nobody has any insight on my life. But here is what I am personally feeling and experiencing.no one takes me seriously and when they do it is disproportionate to what happened what I did or what the grand scheme of the situation is.I get interrupted so often and so violently that I just feel isolated and completely rejected on such a level I cannot even begin to describe.I rarely stand up for myself or say anything because I have had such viscerally aggressive responses from my family and terrible people in my life that I fear some random stranger will do the same and I deserve it in some way.I have very little desire to be around anyone I know. I genuinely want to live peacefully by myself.....in a fucking cave or something. Just....not have a contact with everyone I know ever againI feel that I am not entitled to expressing myself what I want or how I feel because throughout my life I have been gaslit lectured and yelled at for doing so for the most basic and simple reason. I know it is sounds one sided and really like you should not care but I swear to God I was grounded for saying that I was sad just because I really did not feel happy about something I was not rude or anythingI feel like I have been punished for having been born the way I am. I feel like I have wasted me life with everyone I know,Depression
25429,25449,can anxiety because 247 confusion? confused intrusive thoughts. I am afraid of dementia. I have chronic anxiety panic hipochondriac etc Anxiety and confusion,Depression
25433,25453,I am not depressed but I have a younger brother who I feel is very depressed and not getting any help. To give you a little of his story. He is 48 years old and still lives at home with his mother and step father. Its a toxic situation. She is way too involved in his life because he has a history of making some bad decisions. He acts like a sullen teenager always lying to her and asking her to stay out of his life. He does not make a lot of money and he is currently paying medical bills and credit card debt but when he was not in debt he still showed no abilityreal desire to move out. He has co workers he is close to and invites over to my house I have a pool. He has asked me to NOT mention that he lives with his mother. I honestly have no idea what he tells people since this small group seem to spend time bouncing from each others homes for BBQs and hanging out. Physically he is in a lot of pain. He is morbidly obese and has lower back knee and ankle pain. He is going in for surgery on his ankles which will increase his medical debt. In the past no matter how hard his life was he always had a smile and a joke. Now his humor is dark he says things about hoping our mother would just die she are not going nowhere for at least another 20 years I am betting. Anyway poor health no money living at home. We think he needs a WIN. Something to help him get momentum and we are trying but he ignores all help. We suggested he talk to a professional and he says his insurance pays for 5 visits and then its all billed for him and he cannot afford it. We offer to pay for him but he refuses the help. He has 4 brothers and we all struggle with things I have a great job but I am 50 lbs overweight 2 other brothers struggle with weight loss and health issues that affect them. So its not like we are all doing so great that he feels he cannot connect with us but we all have gotten our work lives sorted at this point and all have jobs that help us thrive where he has one that only helps him get by. We are thinking of doing an intervention but he is so defensive and private that we are not sure if it will go well or do any good. Thoughts? Does an Intervention work for Depression?,Depression
25491,25511,twsuicideampx200Bampx200Bampx200B Today's been my worst day so far in my life. I am not even sure how to describe it nothing terrible has happened I have dealt with feeling bad and depressed for all my life and always kept it to myself and occasionally had episodes where I have imploded and felt like shit but today's different I was having a normal day and something triggered a real bad depressive episode I feel numb and the only thing going through my head right now is harming myself I do not care about anything else. I have deleted all my social media and instant messaging apps and the only thing I am looking forward to is going home burying myself in bed and crying I am scared and I do not know how to react to this I have not had any suicidal thoughts since I was 14 I am 25 now and that is the only thing lingering in my head right now. I feel like I have dug myself in a hole too deep to get out of I have nobody to talk to about this in real life. I do not even know why I am posting this. Worst depression episode ever.,Depression
25555,25575,I feel like trash to say the least. I dropped out of university last year I quit my job yesterday after only a month because I could not do it anymore I am severely depressed about this and everything else and it feels like everyone is screaming at me you are a failure you cannot do anything... and i feel like a burden to everyone. I am 24 now and I have accomplished nothing since I finished high school. I am so done I am on the verge of crying 247 and keep having nightmares. Everyone keeps telling me that life is hard for everyone and so on but that does not help me it just makes me more depressed. Can someone relate? I do not know what to do. I keep wishing I was dead but I do not want to kill myself because deep down I still have hope that someday I might find a life I am happy with. But I do not know how to get there I have no energy left in me. I feel so useless depressed and like a burden to everyone around me how do I continue from here?,Depression
25569,25589,I have been trying to get help for awhile now and recently I went to hospital and they helped me a lot in planning what to do. But since this morning my GP has passed me to a mental health team which then passed me back to the GP I have been on the phone all morning dealing with this while I had a whole plan to discuss this with my GP and resolve all this but it seems no one wants to listen to me and the only help I get is when I am in a desperate moment being in the hospital. I just feel no one cares when I need help and only help when they see something has happened. Doctors are difficult to deal with rant,Depression
25571,25591,Sorry for the rant but I just want to get it out and maybe get someone else's opinion.I feel like most things are messed up wealth inequality fueled by technology inheritance and corrupt politicians disinformation and lack of education from antivaxers QAnon but also average people not really understanding science biology technology etc high property prices in western world for most places in Europe you need to cough up 10 years' worth of annual salary for a place to stay source technology fueling disinformation and mental health problems see Centre for Humaine Tech just feel like it is very difficult if you want to live a 'good' life want your own place to stay? Need to pay interest to the bank. want to earn a lot so you do not have to take huge loan? Throw out your morals and work for Facebook or any other tech company that is making money from sucking the soul read big data analytics and advertising out of people. want to live in a nice city? Contribute to inequality by renting. want to go to somewhere not so expensive? Then you will face the following integrating in the society there as an expat unless you only care about yourself. Good luck if you do not have people skills are more introverted. potentially higher corruption lack of jobs longer commute which leads to other problems other hidden costsSo I ask... what other option is there? How is feeling depressed about this an irrational reaction?In any case thank you for reading! Hope you are doing well! I feel like 99 of things are meaningless immoral or just bad,Depression
25578,25598,No intro straight to the message on this one. I had a dream the other day. I was in a tall building with my parents we all went to an event like a wedding or something. We were laughing and joking on the parking lot. We go upstairs on an elevator and get to the event. For some reason I had to go to the parking lot again so I took the elevator again. The doors open on the first floor and I just see this beautiful young woman around my age with the most beautiful energy that I have ever witnessed. I did not knew her but I needed her no more and no less. She smiles to me and I smile back and I start a conversation with her. We both needed to go to the third floor for some reason it was that specific floor but the elevator did not worked. I asked if we could walk together and she smiles and says yes. We talk for what I felt like minutes but in reality we have spent a couple months together! I could just not believe it. We still not found the way up so I said to her hey what if we just go home? She thinks about it and says yes. O know were both scared but we still start going to the exit and we go to the street as we head home our home! We open the door and our families are meeting each other because we were just married. I speak to my parents and she tells me to go to the bedroom when I am finished. I end up talking to my parents so I am headed to the bedroom and she tells me to chill for a while with her so we cuddle in the bed. Then she tells me to check on you are daughter just in front of the bed. I check on her and she is the most beautiful thing I have seen just as her mother. We cuddle again. And there is when it hits me it was like I have had the Titanic in the chest. I have realized that I had as much as I could ever asked for. I had a beautiful wife had a daughter a home family I was happy I had peace I felt a fulfilled life. And just as I cuddle with her close my eyes and tell her that I love her so i could be happy forever I woke upMy smart watch detects my sleep. I checked out as usual and during the REM phase my heartbeats went extremely lower than usual and i could not breath. This dream this dream specifically almost kills me. I think it was the last part I was going to simply give up. I had everything I wanted I felt fulfilled as I always wanted to.I think there was a war inside me in that moment. The part of me that wants to give up ve the one that will do whatever it takes to survive for something better. And I almost lost. I am not sleeping with the watch anymore soTo anyone reading this If I lose this battle against myself do not worry for me because I was happy and fulfilled. In my last moments I experienced love satisfaction and the peace that I needed for so long. I am with the ones that I am missing on this earth catching up and taking care of my loved ones even from far away. If I die,Depression
25614,25634,This is too much. Everyday i am getting weaker and weaker. I do not know how much longer I am going to be doing this. I cannot do this anymore. There is no help. Life sucks. One day I will murder Life. I will murder it. This pain,Depression
25706,25726,I just wrote about 1000 words about this and lost it thanks to a page refresh. FMLWell tldr putting in the work and the struggle to go on living rather than taking one's life it is not that different. Living is the act of bringing about death. Working getting terrible sleep being stressed eating poorly sitting all day.. these things that I do in the name of fighting to stay alive and support myself they damage my body and hasten death in much the same way as if I were intentionally self harming. Tenacity as Passive Suicide,Depression
25710,25730,want to just stay inside today Today,Depression
25751,25771,Not sure if anyone really cares but I am tired. I have been tired all day. Took two naps. I think I will be tired tomorrow too...But I do not know. I wish...I wish I could do something different tomorrow...so I do not feel like I am in a cell. I wish I could sleep for longer. And...I wish I could just escape. My eyes are really droopy now. And this blanket is really warm and comfortable. I am tired...sleepy.I am going to sleep. Goodnight I guess. I am going to sleep now...,Depression
25758,25778,Is it just me that loves sleeping ? It calms me from all the thoughts and I feel like I am being hugged from my blanket and stuffed animal I feel warm yet cold. I feel peaceful Bed,Depression
25783,25803,Idk what to do to feel like anyone likes me or has any interest in me. I am so boring bc I cannot leave my apartment without having a panic attack. No one wants to spend time with me and I am the only one who reaches out for plans. I am going to end up alone. I wish someone in my life would just fucking realize how much I fight off the urge to hurt myself and how often I cannot hold back. I just want to feel normal I always feel worthless,Depression
25800,25820,I miss her so much. We hurt each other but she really fucked me up. Smoking a pack a day eating pills more than food. I am lost and there is no one to find me. What am I looking for? An end. I tried to find it multiple times and it never worked. My entire life has been filled with heartache death and all sorts of fucked up shit. I feel like this ends with me. I always told myself my resilience came from carrying my two brothers in my heart so they could live on through my memories. If I die 3 people die. It will not be a suicide it will be me killing their memories and myself. I do not even want help I want to find peace. I miss her so much. I hate that she was the remedy because that was way too much pressure to place on her. I never told her that she was the cure she knew it I am sure. I hate how we ended things and I cannot reach out to her now even if I wanted. she will never come to look because I am the last thing she wants to see. But as you know Annie I am just a kid from queens and nothing do not mean shit to me.LoveRazor blade salvation R Tonights unbearable Annie,Depression
25825,25845,I am so tired. Today was a hard day I am still dealing with the consequences of a mental breakdown. I went fully back to work today after having covid. Posy covid symptoms fucking suck and they are affecting me a lot chest pain exhaustion I stopped eatingand therefore affecting my work performance. My job is the only thing tangible thing in my life if that makes sense and now it is fading away.I just feel exhausted today useless worthless... specially worthless. Like I do not deserve shit. I am terrified. My suicidal thoughts were strong today. I feel like this is the only place where I will not feel judge and will not bother anyone because I am a whole package. I just want to disappear,Depression
25831,25851,I have a huge problem with self sabotage. I cannot enjoy life. My issues are on my mind 100 of the time. If they are not in the forefront then they are in the background. I distract myself from life using my phone and television. Every time I feel like life is going good I just get anxiety about how its all going to come crashing down and that I do not deserve happiness. I work in customer service and am really good at putting on a fake smile and playing the part of a really happy and pleasant person. But I cannot keep it up for the people in my life that I love. I feel like a huge burden to anyone I am attached to. I fuck it all up for myslef,Depression
25854,25874,When to stop crying? I do not think I care anymore. I feel nauseous and headache and a little twinge of chest pain. Is that a grief problem? I just do not want to get sick. I know people going to treat me differently. I cannot stop crying. I sorry I do not mean to spam. I just cannot stop thinking about my dad. I do not know what to do we cannot afford to burry him. I put up a fundraiser without talking to my sister and other family because I do not want him to be cremated. I am a little panicking right now because I do not know if everyone know he gone or not and that is a horrible way to find put a love has pass on. I am not really thinking right now. My head hurts. I am not as well spoke and smart like the others I just want to help. When it happens to you,Depression
25879,25899,I know nobody's really going to see this let alone respond to it. But I have not been feeling myself since February. Before that I was happy... At least more than I am now and I kept hoping that I would get better. I kind of knew though that I could never go back to how I used to be since this all started. Today has been a reminder of that. I was physically okay. I am adequately functioning and taking care of myself but I just feel so tired. This entire week I have been feeling nothing but fatigue and today it was just so much harder to power through. I am frustrated. I am angry. At everyone even though I know it is not their fault at all. Not necessarily. As I said before I blocked my friends on social media and to say the least I did not miss them at all. I had to almost force myself to at least give them an explanation. I am tired of my family...my mother keeps commenting on how skinny I look she forces me to eat when I eat anyways. I always eat I just choose to eat healthily. I make sure I get the right amount of nutrientsfibersvitamins from the food I am eating. I know how to manage myself. I do not need to be babysat like a twoyearold. I am sick of trying not to be disrespectful or rude to avoid conflict. I am sick of taking criticism from other people. I am also very sick of lying to people to keep the peace. I just want to be left alone. it is better for me to be alone if not I can end up destroying a lot of other people because I am irritable sad and angry all at the same time all the time. Sometimes I think this is sort of a domino effect thing caused by my father's death or it is my period. But either way this feels very real and I just want to be left alone...I was thinking last night that maybe my fate is not to become this great doctor or successful child that goes to college and does all this grown up stuff...maybe I am just supposed to be in a mental facility for the rest of my life. ampx200BIf you are curious here is a diary entry I wrote in FeburaryDear moon I cry to you hoping that you will hear meOr at least listenIt may not matter to me much anywayBut I am becoming deeply and utterly sadMore often during the night I refuse to call myself depressed because that would be quite an inaccuracy but at the same time I cannot think of a time that I was truly happy. My smile has become a stranger to this new meThis new me is dismal and aloofSongs that used to make me want to dance now make me want to cryVideos that are meant to be happy are interpreted to such a sadness one could not fathom to obtain To contain this state is to climb a mountain in a snowstorm Playing pretend has shifted from a childhood game to a chilling reality.All while I am confused about whether or not this will last I still know one thing for sure.That I will talk to the moon tomorrow and try again.Anyways I have to eat some nasty ass tacos bye. Nobody Responds to Things Like These,Depression
25895,25915,do not have any money for anything. I can barely afford school supplies. This is horrible. Lost someone that I feel looks like me. I do not know how to feel. My sister says we should just have him cremated but I just want to have a chance to say goodbye. Dad pass away,Depression
25896,25916,16F Why do I have to be so young and suffer with depression and anxiety? I have been to counseling when I was 14 and that never helped and now I am diagnosed with bipolar which I feel like I am really not. I am on this stupid medication that makes me feel numb. I try to talk to my mom or my therapist and they tell me to stay on the meds because they are helping but I feel like they are making me feel worse. I honestly feel like no one understands me. I feel like I cannot express how I truly feel because I fear being diagnosed with some even more serious mental illness. Its so depressing to know I have to deal with a mental illness for the rest of my life at such a young age. I feel so stuck. I do not have that much of a social life and I feel unmotivated to try to. I do not even have a bad home life yet I feel so alone. I do not look forward to my future at all and do not even know what I want to do with my life. I hate expectations that society puts on people my age. I have all As grades for this school year because I do want to graduate and maybe go to college but I do not know what I want out of life. I honestly hate school even though I succeed. I am feel more happy with things that do not require a lot of school but I know that they will never be long term success and Ill never be successful in life without a degree in something that I hate. Sorry this was all over the place but I just need somewhere to vent. I feel like I am lost,Depression
25906,25926,Hello I am new here and I wanted to get these things off of my chest. I have found myself struggling the couple year with depression even though I have been dealing with it for years. I found a partner two years ago and fell in love but my depression took ahold of my relationship. I was outgoing and had a great outlook on life after leaving a school for software development. It started going downhill quickly after. I could not find work in the field I was struggling financially and I started losing my confidence with my partner. I found myself in outbursts of anger and guilt being so stressed out. Later in the relationship I was cheated on. I was broken and did not take any of it lightly. Once I hurt myself dealing with the pain. We became pregnant and everything was looking upwards then I was going through a paternity test in the beginning of Covid19. It lasted for months to find out and instead of patiently waiting. I was completely depressed and self isolating daily. Moving forward to now I have not left that place my relationship is in shambles I am not outgoing caring or taking care of myself at all. I still get angry and cannot control my emotions on a day to day basis. One moment I am happy and I try to cling onto it as much as possible but it slips away so quickly. My thoughts completely take over and all of a sudden I think something is wrong. This is reoccurring almost daily. I feel like each time I only push my partner away even further. I sometimes think she would be better offf with someone else since we keep splitting and coming back together. I wish I was the person before all of this. Now I am barely holding onto myself Holding on to glimmers of happiness,Depression
25980,26000,I cannot enjoy anything.All the things I used to love now leave me indifferent at best. My craft? I am not good at it anymore no point in trying. Music? It all sounds like noise. Videogames? they are all boring and samey. Friendships? I do not have those anymore. I do not have anything going on in my life no career no education no money no skills nothing I can be proud of. I am well aware my problem has a solution working hard earning what I want but none seems to understand that I do not have it in me to solve my own life.I do not want to go to college I want to sleep all day long scream until my throat hurts and cry my eyes out.Life is pointless to me and the only reason why I am not ending it all is because of my boyfriend. I am just waiting for him to get tired of me so I can put an end to my suffering. No joy,Depression
25993,26013,How I read about what deepest despair they live in. How they do not want to live anymore. it is so sad to hear from them how they have phrases full sadness and see the vast emptiness in their eyes see them lose themselves. It is so terrible how people dry up and everything just turns gray for them. It is so terrible to realize that you cannot help them because you cannot even help yourself. It is terrible to read how people collapse.,Depression
25997,26017,I do not know what to do. 8 months ago I was 147 pounds. Now I am 169. I am only 510 and I feel like I am about to lose it. I am going on a trip to see my family who is fairly toxic when it comes to weight and I am so fucking scared I already deal with body dysmorphia and I do not know what to do. I need to go from 170 to at least 150 or less in 3 weeks which means 6.67 pounds a week. How the fuck do I achieve something like that? Do I do less than 500 calories a day or something since you need 3500 calories burned to get rid of 1 pound of fat. And if my natural burn rate is 2000 calories a day and I eat 500 that is only 1500. So I need to burn 2000 more calories a day to achieve around a pound a day to keep my 6.67 pound a week loss.I am already dealing with really bad depression which causes me to constantly overeat and binge because it makes me feel better so now I need to control that to not get ridiculed by my fucking family. My mom looked so disappointed and disgusted when I told her I was 167. Now I am 2 pounds over that.I do not have any more therapy sessions left since my insurance will not cover any more for this year and I am spiraling.My family needs to deal with a slowly overweight depressed body dysmorphic closeted bitch and pretend like its fine. Fuck. I need to lose 20 pounds. I need to. I need to lose 20 pounds in 3 weeks and I am at a breaking point,Depression
26000,26020,I am 23m and I have been dealing with depression since I was 14 that was when I was diagnosed and anxiety since I was 3 separation anxiety from 38 social anxiety sinceTLDR Read the last large paragraph I do not know how I can condense it more than thatWhen I was 3 my parents broke up I was always close to my mum and to my dad I was more of an object to be owned than his son but because he believed he deserved to have me he fought my mum for me. I know he did not care because I anytime I was with him I was put aside and never really interacted with and when I did not want to go with him he would pry my off a lamppost while I was crying and drag me to the car to take me to his house. All of this is what brought the first sembalances of my anxiety and low self esteem because if my own blood does not really love me then I took it as there was something wrong with me. And to top it off he cheated on my mum which is why they broke up and he did it before and after they were together with other women.After that my mum remarried and her next partner was fine at first but he changed when they had my younger brother. After that I was treated as a hindrance and due to the troubles of on going custody and court stuff my dad was causing during there relationship my mum's partner saw me as my father's son and took out his frustrations on me in the first of gas lighting and mental abuse. This went on from when I was 5 till 17. He also mentally abused my mum and older sister but my little brother had an illness and my mum felt she had to stay for him. Only when he was older did she leave him and thus I was freed from his abuse.I also had an accident when I was 14 and fractured my hip I could not walk on it at all for a year and could use partial weight only a year after that. That was the final straw for me and made me deeply depressed because the one place I could get away to was school and after not being there for months I felt alienated and alone. I am the end I just retreated to my room as that was the only place I had some semblance of safety left.All this is what has led to my deep rooted self hatred low self worth anxiety and depression. Since all of that all I have managed to do is idly spend my time retreating into games and barely really living. To top it all off the last 2 friends I had completely distanced themselves from me because of a difference of views and now I have no one but my mum and my siblings. Even my grandparents who always were there for me have dementia and cannot even remember me when they see me.I just feel so alone and that everyone will leave me one day And when they do there will be no reason left for me to live even now I feel that it would be better if I just died now and saved the trouble of my family having to support me while I leech off their kindness. I do not want to be a burden but I feel so useless and I know how lazy I am and hate myself for it. I just do not know if there is a way out of the mess in my head and to live a life worth living.I am sorry if this has been extremely long and too much I just wanted to say something somewhere to relieve the feeling built up inside 23m Just need to get how I feel off my chest as I have no one I can talk to,Depression
26039,26059,It feels like life has a serious bone to pick with me... I have not had the best of childhoods so I am high on cPTSD but not only that... It seems anything I try to do ends up hurting me or like it is the wrong decision. Like... I cannot do anything right. Do you know the feeling where on top of big things small issues happen daily so in the end it feels like much more of a big deal than it is? I am just done... I barely survived my last depressive episode and I try so hard to keep myself afloat. But it is like I am trying to climb out of a hole just so I can step and fall in the next one. Today my dog hurt his hip. it is a 9 year old dog and honestly lately I have been thinking about how he is the one thing I cannot bare to lose and I am so scared. The vet said he needs surgery as soon as possible but in a specific town because in our country there are no good vets anywhere. I have to drive him there tomorrow and I do not even know if I can get an appointment. Not only that but I am so tight on money I am barely getting by and this surgery is going to cost more than I have in my bank account... I also have to pay toll and gas I have no idea how I am going to manage to do all of that. There are no installment payments and I cannot just take out a loan here. I have no one to ask except for my mum and she also probably will say no. I got so dizzy hearing the diagnosis that I got an anxiety attack and had to leave the clinic to cool down. My mom acted like I was super ungrateful to her because I left her with the doctor and the dog until I could catch my breath. Fuck... I seriously do not know what to do. he is the only buddy I have had with me for the last 9 years. I feel so worthless I am done honestly,Depression
26042,26062,I am 15 and play guitar and have not for like 4 years and I have slowly built up confidence over the years so i can play in front of people and this summer my mam will probably have loads of parties and get drunk with her friends and I am normally there and I normally drink and a lot more than she knows and I normally mix alcohol and meds to get high basically and this summer I am going to perform in front of like 15 people and I am going to get drunk every day and I am going to destroy shit and abuse the shit out if my body and hopefully by the end of the summer i will have killed myself one way or another I just want to vent sort of,Depression

26109,26129,During high school I would cry pretty much every single day when I got back home. I was going through horrible low moods my sleep schedule was incredibly messed up and I would just want to sleep and stay in bed when possible. I had no drive or motivation for anything but I just continued with the routine of daily life and what is expected of a high school student. At the time I did not really realise I was depressed I thought it was just a rough patch that would hopefully stop one day. I knew I was exhibiting symptoms of depression but I never really thought this is depression and I am depressed as though there were something wrong with me mentally and that it all lied with me as an individual and my character.I then got into University and hoped for a fresh start. I had a decent time there and socially had no problems but I myself as an individual was still pretty much depressed and struggled academically. This significantly increased my stress and at times my depression and throughout University I never really had the opportunity to have a pure break because I would have to study throughout the holidays. Whilst I had multiple break downs throughout I do not think it was as bad as during school.Done with University and back with my family because I wanted to take a small break from everything. I used to have a lot of problems with my parents particularly with my mother and my moving back was most probably not best for my mental health. Again almost like at school I would cry quite regularly and feel incredibly low with no drive or motivation. Went through two years of horrible fights with them but ultimately I believe I have finally managed to patch things up with my mother. We most probably have the best relationship right now than we have had for the past 10 years. At that time I realised that I have been pretty much depressed since high school driven by my relationship with my parents. I still hold negative feelings towards them sometimes but we r both working to being better with each other. I got back to University but still am with my family. With the pandemic I am stuck at home most of the time. I am extremely introverted and honestly relish the time where I am completely alone. However being at home with studies and my family has been quite stressful and throughout the past year the stress has been continuously building up. My parents mental health had also been struggling with the pandemic and as I have pretty much since I was a kid I would support them a lot during these times. This also subtly contributed to my stress. I had not managed to have an actual break though I do have long periods of stress induced procrastination and eventually I messed something up a month ago and had a horrible break down like the ones I had during the worst of my times back during my old University or school years. I felt like this time I ridiculously felt the physical effects of stress and depression and really felt like they could kill me. For what has been pretty much a decade of depression bad sleep and poor coping skills with stress I have experienced physical symptoms like pain. But right now I feel like its all building up to the point of boiling over or it already has. I am repeating the same cycle of procrastination self hate not recovering from feeling horrible and stressed even though I really do try to go to sleep earlier or exercisego out for walks. I really do not need to socialise with people and I do maintain decent contact with my friends. I feel depressed pretty much 247 when I am not distracting myself with music media entertainment socialising. I cannot focus on my studies at all and I am just so tired. I have been tired for a decade and I just do not know what to do anymore. I always tell myself that one day it just will not be like this but I am exhausted drained and no matter how much I rest I just feel horrible. I do not know what to do anymore. Depressed since high school,Depression
26146,26166,Hi I know not many will read this but I am actually curious if I will actually get any response to this.I am drunk to distract myself from depression and stress.I should actually do my homework for college right now but there is no motivation. Like always. Can anybody relate? Of course you can. This is my first ever post on social media just to get any reaction of this world. This is so ridiculous. I am so drunk right now,Depression
26154,26174,Been a year and a day since my cat died. No one to talk through the pain with no one to distract me from the pain no one because every human I care about has been dead longer than that. And making new connections? Well I do not like most of you. I bring myself to tolerate one of you people once in a blue moon and quickly you infuriate me and make me regret it.I have long struggled to get along with people but more and more I am finding myself disgusted and annoyed by humanity. This emptiness in my heart where love used to be I have this desire to fill it with new love but I cannot even meet humans I like. Really this rant did not need to be posted but this is meant to be a blanket message for the people in my inbox asking me are you doing any better? NO I am NOT DOING ANY FUCKING BETTER. EVERYONE IS STILL DEAD I am STILL ALONE MAGIC did not FIX MY LIFE SOMEHOW YOU CAN STOP ASKING BECAUSE IT IS NEVER GETTING BETTER! I have not even been posting on reddit and you fucking dogooders are still in my inbox offering clichd advice that has nothing to do with my fucking life or situation. Maybe it worked for you and your broken marriage or for your neglectful spouse or whatever the fuck your issue is but it has nothing to do with a misanthropic hermit who is disgusted by humanity. Everyone you care about every last being on this planet you care about has to die before you can walk a mile in my shoes. So stop thinking you can give me any fucking advice when you still have happiness and love in your life you do not know how it is to be devoid of it. ampx200BThis means all of you sending me checkup messages I did not ask for. I do not want your attention I do not want your kind words. You are trying to be nice to a disturbed person to feel better about yourself it is mental masturbation it does nothing for me. You want to help me? Pay my rent. Get me high. Suck my cock literally. I still hate this world and I still hate you.,Depression
26166,26186,I just feel so alone everyday is the same as the previous and i do not know how much more i can handle. I have nobody around me that i will confident to go and talk to them about how i feel not my family or friends. I barely talk to anyone nowadays whenever I am alone often i start crying because of such thoughts that nobody actually cares. I just wish i could have an actual best friend that would be there for me in these kind of times empty,Depression
26198,26218,My day feels like a void. Time is just dragging on. I have no one to talk to I cannot find interest in doing anything the things I force myself to do just to pass time I cannot stay focused on. I feel like a zombie and completely desperate to escape. Everything just feels endless with no relief anywhere. I hate how slow everything is with depression,Depression
26204,26224,I feel like nothing really matters anymore. Everyone just leaves me. All the good things all the good people. Everyone just leaves. Its like they want to be there for me but as soon as they see what a mess I am they leave for their own sanity. I feel horrible. I just feel so alone. So exhausted. I cannot blame them... I am truly pathetic. I feel like it will be good if I am just gone yk? Some of them might mourn for a few days but in the end they will move on will be happy wo me. At least they will not have to deal w my bs. Why am I like this? Why cannot I just have one person who will not give up on me?feel like I do not deserve anything. I am just done w my life. I do not feel like living anymore. Sorry yll have to read my bs,Depression
26249,26269,First off I just want to say that I know they love and care about me. But it is just in the wrong ways... they just do not get me at all and they will try do shit for me that I really could not give less of a shit about.. I mean... I appreciate the thought but everything they do for me I just pretend to to along and enjoy for their sake.For example when I got accepted into uni they took me to the cheesecake factory to celebrate even though they know in on a strict diet so I just got a salad while they all got full meals and cake etc.. just feel like nothings actually for me anymore tbh..I mean recently I just have not had the energy to shower or shave or get a haircut anything really... and even though I look like a fkn hobo they still appear oblivious..I mean for the past four years I have been a major gym addict and I basically took a month off and just got fat and used food as a coping mechanism and they did not even notice...They just take so much credit away from me and say they helped me out with uni so much etc even though they would not have even know I appliedgot accepted until after I told them. I am just sick of them being such hardasses... I hate my parents,Depression
26276,26296,Is it really worth all the trouble? My biggest concern is that I put all this time and effort in just to hate it and realize it will not really help me get a job after I am out. I am 26 I have worked about 8 different jobs in the last 5 years and I have about 40 college credits I am also depressed and suicidal. Main reason I signed those papers was because I thought it would help me catch up to my peers and have a normal life for once. Almost every time I am depressed it is because I feel like I did not do anything in life. Sure I am married but that is it I do not have kids do not have a career do not have friends or a social life. I pretty much just stay home clean the house and watch TV or play video games. I am starting to think that the military will not help me get that normal life I want so badly in fact I was denied a job because of being on standby for the military. I do not know if it is better that I just catch up on my own instead of joining the military. Advice please? Should I join the military to help me catch up in life? Or should I go another route?,Depression
26341,26361,idk why but it will not stop. I have been awake for about 3 hours but i cannot seem to get up. I would be late for work if i was already there. i wish i could turn my mind off. it just finds the pain and then makes it worse. still doing it.,Depression
26368,26388,For awhile now I have had a mix of an anxious and empty mood. Some days I feel better than others. I keep busy everyday with my job and hobbies. What bothers me is I have never been diagnosed with anything yet. I had an assessment and they felt it was anxiety at the time. I got a second opinion and same thing. Throughout this I get really vivid dreams and hypnagogic hallucinations. This can be stressful and make it hard to get enough sleep. I have no idea how to get help for this. I deal with this frequently. have not felt myself,Depression
26390,26410,I have this awful habit of thinking that I am cursed to never get what I want. Am I depressed because I have the wrong attitude that keeps me from getting what I want ? I do want to label my depression as bad luck. I would like to take responsibility and continue working on myself if I only knew what I am doing wrong. If anyone had a similar experience and managed to escape from constant failure I would like to know what you did. In order to explain what is going on I need to tell a very long story. I am 27 years old and I live in the Netherlands. Have always had a sense of dread looming over me. As a child I had an abusive dad who did not allow me to have negative emotions since he did not want to take responsibility for anything. Got severely bullied at school and beaten at home for no good reason. I kept moving more than 10 times was even homeless for a while and never got to develop social skills as a child. Physical and mental pain was the only thing I knew. And I always believed it was my fault when I got beaten. One time I burned my hand while cooking and my father got angry beat me and kicked me out of the house without given me a chance to put cool water on it it was even a Sunday so the doctor's office was closed. I had to do everything myself and if I got any kind of personal problems I received tantrums instead of help like when I burned my hand. A therapist concluded that I was a neglected child. In high school I managed to get some friends but no friend group I was people's left over acquaintance. I did not my mind since for the first time I had friends even though I rarely got invited for anything and some treated my really bad but I did not know better I assumed this was the best I deserve. In high school I was a terrible student did not know why but I used my time their as a place to get fun since I could not get it at home. Still had to do everything myself learning to ride a bike learning to shave did not know how to study or prepare things. In high school I was still severely depressed since I still lived on egg shells and still got bullied and beaten at home for nothing. Often got long speeches from my father how I have a despicable character. Took me long time to realize that my treatment at home was not my fault and I did not deserve it was around 24 when I realized that. Never got any recognition that I did my high school well even though I barely had elementary school and a reading disability due to the lack of school as a child. At 15 years old for the first time in my life two friends wanted to drop by at my birthday but my sibling did not want it since we do not do those things while he had a large group of friends. He is still friends with them after more than a decade. This developed into a crooked world view if I saw an ad at school or any opportunity for something fun I assumed in my subconscious I was not the target audience. This I did until I was 25. After high school I managed to get into the top university of my country. Finally lived on my own at 19 years old my parents did not even bother asking where I lived. Could barely afford it asked my parents for some money sometimes just enough to buy minimal groceries did not eat warm every day since I did not want to bother them. Still had the attitude that good things are not meant for me and stayed depressed and lonely. Dropped out of school since my depression kept me from studying. And here is where I changed my world view even though it still took years to realize it. I went back to the same university since I was desperate for a better life. Nothing changed.... I did not eat any junk food went to the gym became extremely disciplined overcame a masturbation addiction that crippled my energy levels worked several nights a week. I still believed that the good things in life were not meant for me. All my hard work was fuelled by the fear that my life would always be filled with despair. I managed to graduate with a master and learned to be social. I became more and more confident in my abilities and learned to be extroverted and daring. But still I tried to connect with people but kept failing. I had a good friendships but as soon that person did not needed my help I get ignored. If I invite people to do things I hardly get a response at all. I only talk with people if I start the conversation. I tried to get dates since I was finally confident in my looks after all the time spent in gyms and failed. I was labelled by a female roommate as one of the nicest person they ever met so I assumed there should at least be one person that likes me back. Now I am trying to get a job but have been living in someone is attic for a year with no social contacts and no success and the idea that good things are not meant for me is back. I graduated in a STEM field from a good university with a skillset that is supposed to be desirable by employers my peers immediately got jobs and I cannot even get to live on my own. Past year has been a void of despair. Worst year in my life so far. I keep getting more disciplined and engaged to get to the next level but things only get worse. I keep asking how much work do I need to do to get at least something in return? I keep looking at other people's lives bad habit I know. How even things that would change my entire live comes so easy to them. Like having someone text them show interest in them getting a job being loved by anyone having a home etc. My therapist told me that I am too demanding on myself but I do not know what else to do besides looking inward. I no longer go to therapy since the therapist moved and I was actually treated for an anxiety disorder hypochondria caused by my childhood which I overcame. I can only work on myself not on others. Even after all this if I knew a direction to get out of my endless despair I would do everything I can to go there but I am at a loss. I tried really hard and I am still at the same mental place where I was as a teen or child. Just me alone watching other people's lives and day dreaming all day since I have nothing else to do..... as usual. Looking for help. I keep failing at everything. I have the feeling that the good life is not meant for me?,Depression
26411,26431,i already have been told my whole life. at wotk i was even publically shamed about it and everyone now teases me because i cried. i activly hurt myself and my so in my life tells me are you done yet i need to sleep. so i just started taking a collage of picture of me to hng on my wall before i kill myself. so they can laugh at me eveeyday. accepting that I am ugly,Depression
26430,26450,So...I am not the type of person that you would describe as depressed I am going out meeting with friends smiling laughing looks like a normal life.Though due to my social anxiety on which I am working on with my therapist 99 of the time I am not the person that engages any activities I would probably sit at home instead. Sometimes I am getting some worse feelings not strictly suicidal but let us say staying near the cliff and asking myself what is going to happen if I jump or even sitting at home and wondering if anybody is going to miss me if I die.It got worse last year when I was on a onemonth sick leave with friends being overloaded at worknot in the country we have had contact only through messenger I do not like speaking to friends on the phone I know they would talk to me then and developed to the point where I realised that I could be in toxic friendship just to not end up alone. It was last month when I started therapy although now I feel that I was not honest with myself during the sessions leading to put focus on something totally different. Right now I am at the point where I am permanently sad with depressive feelings for like 90 of the time when I am talking to somebody it disappears but it is just temporary thing few minutes later after we end up a convo I am again feeling like a shit.I have tried different things riding a bike leading to some stronger anxiety attacks playing a games cooking making me sometimes crying because of awful results and dozen different things where I have just lost motivation.For sure I want to talk with therapist about that but I am afraid that at the time of the session I will forget about it as I mentioned when I am talking to somebody this feelings are disappearing. Have anybody of you experienced that? How did you cope with that? Is it depression?,Depression
26444,26464,laying here with my wrists cut open. struggling to feel anything at all. I do this too many nights...kill me I am really not okay. I am dying,Depression
26503,26523,Hey guysI hope this is the right sub to post this kind of stuff. I feel like I am in a deep hole and do not know how to escape from there. I have a bachelor degree in political science and always wanted to work in international organizations but I get rejected in every job or even internship I apply for. I do not even feel like I should finish my master's degree since it feels like another useless degree. So I do not have a job in my field and my mother has to support me which is awful.I would like to switch the field and get a job fast but I do not have any ideas or drive to do it.And since I did not meet any people during Covid it affected me in such a way that I am now afraid of people. It dreads me to talk to new people or get in a situation where many people are. Even though it was not like that for me. I feel like I fucked up badly in life,Depression
26559,26579,I have no motivation to do anything... like anything hobbies do not interest me as they did before. I used to like playing video games but now I try and play for like 30 mins and it gets boring when I used to play for a few hours years ago. I used to play basketball but I do not have the same interest anymore... I can play it for probably 30 mins and then it also gets boring when I used to play hours like a few years ago. I have online businesses that I want to start but its impossible to do because I literally have no motivation to start it I have started other online ventures in the past but now I have no motivation.I literally wake up go on my PC and I guess browse the internet for hours. Time goes by fast as fuck even though I do not do anything. Time goes by fast even when not on my PC like I guess the days go by fast and it feels like I do not have time to do anything... even though I am not doing anything. I forget so much and I do not even remember what happened in the few weeks or remember stuff. I want to do stuff because it feels like I am wasting my time doing nothing. Its been like this for the past 2 years and months go by and I have nothing accomplished. It feels like this year started a few months ago yet we are already half way through the year its scary and I do not know what to do. Motivation,Depression
26567,26587,Why live? It will not get better it is an incurable illness. You can stanch it with drugs but that does not sound like living to me. Some of us here know we will eventually take ourselves out its just a matter of time but the wars over and we are fighting a lost battle When your permanent state is depression,Depression
26593,26613,Title says it really I tried to OD just under a month ago and now whenever I need to take a tablet or a pill I get this really weird shadowy feeling on me like something is going to happen.Anyone had something similar or know how to overcome it? After a failed overdose whenever I take pills I feel really weird?,Depression
26604,26624,The way I describe my depression is it is hell. I am tired all the time no matter how much I sleep I do not feel recharge even if I sleep for a good amount of time or take sleep medication because you just know your brain is saying stay up all night. I do not have friends because I do not trust anyone which leads me to fearing for my future I mean how can I find a partner and love them if I cannot trust anyone. I am 23F and I do not do anything I should be doing at my age and it just gets worse with age. I feel like a zombie watching the world go by. No one understands in my family saying happiness is a choice well it is not when you have depression when everyday your brain is feeling you you suck the world sucks nothing you do will ever matter just die already so on and so on. You cannot find anything that makes you happy and when you do it is gone just like that. You want help but that help will not be able to change the life you lived will not change the choices you have made it the life you live now only make you expect what is happening when all you want to do is rage and yell. My experience with depression,Depression
26613,26633,Seriously when I look back at all my attempts all I am filled with is deep regret I did not go through with it. Not one single moment even the best of them has been worth the following pain and discomfort that I live with on a daily basis. I hardly feel anything for anyone anymore as well and it is just miserable watching all my current relationships slowly dry up into nothingness. I truly despise being brought into this god forsaken world Each day I do not off myself is another day I will regret later,Depression
26636,26656,This is not an episode I have felt this way more than half of my life. I think we all feel this way about something in our lives.. something we cannot change because it is a part of us. What we ourselves being our biggest critics consider our biggest flaw. Mine is ANY social interaction.I mean parents sibling family friends girlfriend and best friend. I just overall hate talking to anyone and I love living inside my own head. I care for people but I am done talking with other people due to the pure fact that no matter how close I am to people I am just too internally nervous to be around anyone.I need a better job to seek a therapist... which will come in 7 months but I guess I am just venting until then. I hate that everyday is the same but anything that should be exciting is not..I just need someone to relate with. I did not know where to go..,Depression
26669,26689,Alot of my comedy worldview and opinions all come from how shitty things are and how shitty being alive is. When people think things are not so bad or just overall positive people I have no idea how to relate to them. Does this happen to anyone else? It almost feels like positivity is toxic for me to be around. Is it difficult for others to hang out with positive people,Depression
26671,26691,I just want to be happy. I feel like its so little to ask for but I can never reach that goal. I do not fit in with anybody and people just treat me like shit wherever I go or whoever I am with. Why do I have to exist in neverending pain. I want to go to sleep one last time and never wake up. Endless Sadness,Depression
26716,26736,Hearing and seeing all these people with their friends and I am here feeling like such an outcast because I have none. Nobody to talk to nobody to love. I have not been with a woman in 4 years and I do not want to carry on any longer. It makes me cry I am sorry if I sound ungrateful I just feel so alone in this world. there is no one I have. Being lonely on holidays sucks the most,Depression
26717,26737,Literally only downloaded Reddit so I could get this of my chest. there is nothing specifically wrong with me I have a supportive family amazing SO a job and almost two degrees. Yet every day all I can think about is ending it all. I feel like I am drowning and no one can hear me. I cannot talk to my gf about it because I do not want to worry her or put a burden on her and I will not tell my parents for the same reason. I try to talk to my best friend about it and he turns the shit around on me like its my fucking fault I have depression. I cannot help it. I try to talk to my big brother about it and he just finds a way to make the situation about himself. Idk. I am just confused and going through the motions rn. Fake it till you make it right? I am not going to do it but I want to.,Depression
26719,26739,My doc prescribed a med to supplement the snri that I am on. The first prescription was free....how nice of them... When I picked it up I see that the pill is 0.25mg and a 30 day supply has a list price of almost 1500.00. that is 200000 per gram. I know that is not what I will ever pay but I am just not going to be part of this insanity. I will find another way. I am finally pushing back on my prescription...,Depression
26735,26755,Everything feels like a blur. it is all meaningless life just flies by day after day and I just forget what happened in the past week. I do not even know what the emotions I feel are anymore. I have not gone outside in over 2 weeks and I cannot exactly do that because I am a minor. I do not want to keep living like this. Blurry,Depression
26739,26759,Hi everyone I am posting on here as kind of a cry for help. I do not really know what to do. For a bit of background I am a 23 year old woman. I graduated from a very elite university and work a job that is relevant to the field I originally wanted to go into medicine but I no longer feel any desire to be a doctor and so my job is kind of dead end and my employer is assuming that I will be going to medical school. I graduated with a very high GPA but toward the end of college I became incredibly reliant on substances to help get me through because I was starting to lose motivation. Doing drugs was one of the worst decisions of my life and thankfully I do not do them anymore but now I have no motivation to accomplish anything. I have tried going to therapy many times but I never get the response that I want. In college I had bad healthcare coverage so it was difficult finding a therapist in the first place outside of school but when I did they recommended group therapy because I did not have a dire case in their opinion. My school therapists never took me seriously and told me I was normal fine as well. I think this is just because I always had good grades exercised and ate healthy slept normally and not to tout my own horn l am an attractive young woman so I think my problems are never taken seriously. When I went to the therapist off campus she also said I was fine normal even though I told her things like my life does not feel real. During covid my mental health just got way worse until I finally reached a breaking point a few weeks ago. Things are reopening and life is resuming but it has just made me feel more anxious about my life and future and I just feel numb to it all. My life feels so unreal. I feel like I live in a simulation and nothing matters. Nothing interests me anymore I do not date I have friends but nothing feels fun with them no other career path excites me. I feel like a hollow she will of woman. I have always had what I thought were mental health problems but at least I had the ability to feel some joy and happiness. That joy is no longer there. I feel there is absolutely nothing that can take me out of this state and I am afraid if I go back to a therapist which I unsuccessfully tried after graduating as well that they will just write me off because I can still function regularly and go on appearing to live a normal life but how I feel is anything but normal. What should I do? 23f feeling depressed,Depression
26748,26768,Its been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I am leaving. I have no closure and still do not even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I do not know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I am a waste of life in their 30s with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just do not have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out but was quickly reminded why I do not spend much time with my family as its only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I have stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily which I had not done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and its been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their lifes purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I cannot even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just do not understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me its time to die. I do not expect any one to respond or even read this. I just have no one. Cry for help,Depression
26757,26777,I have struggled with mental illness my whole life. From the early age of 6 I was diagnosed with anxiety and OCD. Later on at about 10 I was diagnosed with ADHD and than a few years later diagnosed with depression. My first depressive episode took place when I was on middle school and after seeing a therapist weekly and going on meds I soon became happy and content with my life. However a few years later now I F17 decided to try and go off my meds. Talking to my parents doctor and therapist we decided to give it a try. And for the first month or so I was completely fine. Nothing was wrong and I felt good. But I soon after had fell into a depressive episode. My trigger was and had been the time before an internal feeling that I was not good enough. This time the trigger had been not getting a part I wanted in a show I was acting in pushing all these intrusive thoughts into my head. The main one that I have struggled with however is the thought of suicide. I do not know why. I do not want to die I do not want everything to end but I cannot shake the thought. And over the next few months it just got worse. I ended up getting into a relationship with a guy from school and we have been dating for almost 3 months. Over this time though I have developed ROCD to the point where I think of my bf and I immediately feel miserable. I feel so bad because he likes me so much and I cannot stop with all the ROCD intrusive thoughts. It got to the point where I would nervous vomit every time I knew I was going to see him. I have no idea what to do. I have ruined multiple eventsvacationsparties for myself by just ruminating on the ROCD thoughts of whether I actually like him or not or if were supposed to be together. I have just fucked up the past few months of my life and relationship. Since then I have gone back on my meds and am seeing my therapist more frequently. Me and my bf are currently on a break but we are meeting up to decide on what to do in 3 days. I have genuinely been better when I have been able to focus on myself but I really do not want to break up with him however hard the relationship might be. I have major guilt from the depression and ROCD thoughts and I do not know what the next step to take is. I have been having these thoughts since we first started dating so how do I know this is just ROCD or are me not meant to be together? My depression has ruined my relationship with my bf and myself,Depression
26777,26797,I have been on lexapro for almost 2 months and I have had some weird symptoms I am going to.. i have lost over 10 pounds and have picked up the very bad habit of procrastinating anything and everything. recently I have had a lot going on family and work wise and i feel the depression cloud creeping up. i need a hobby or something but i do not feel like i have the time. also is it possible i could be building dependency already? sorry this post was all over the place. answer any questions you can it is greatly appreciated! lexapro,Depression
26794,26814,my girlfriend was all i had now that is gone too. she was all i had and i was all she had so why the fuck did we let it go. I am so fucking stupid i knew that if we ever broke up it result in her doing something stupid and now she could be dead because of this. i will never forgive myself and i am going to live the rest of my life in pain if it is even fucking worth living. i do not know how i even got out of bed just now. the truth is right now i feel better than i thought i would. but it is only the first day. I am terrified of tomorrow coming so that is why i have not been laying down sobbing and waiting to fall asleep because i know as soon as i fall asleep tomorrow will come and whatever happened with her I will have to face reality. what the fuck have i done. nothing lasts. she was all i had,Depression
26806,26826,Crippling can mean different things to different people. For me at times my depression hits me like a thunderbolt that causes a very hollow feeling which is hard to explain I do not want to be around people I do not want to speak I cry my heart aches.What are your crippling emotions? How frequently do you have crippling depression?,Depression
26846,26866,As I write in rdepression. I state my life is fine. I know decent people and I have survived the indecent. I have learned a lot and my life is very decent for a 26 year old black man born in low class society. The worst thing in my life is probably masturbation and with that I am down to like 1 a days. I have goals and dreams. My family is decent enough. I have ladies in my life. I am actually Elevating I can feel it. I have never gotten the girl I was after everyone I have wanted I have failed at so all my loves are circumstantial. I achieve in all but the loves I choose. In that I have still had women I still achieve the casual sex and I am about to be a millionaire and I doubt that will hurt my chances and I have even analyzed all my failure and it is made me better in my approach... so yea nothings wrong with me. Failure was never an option because I did not quit. I believe in God and I have beat the suicidal tendencies. there is nothing I dislike more in a game than a quitter. Why rdepression? I feel like life's been an interesting ordeal to say the least but fuck I feel like being a black man on this planet blows. If I had not joined the military in the past I would be fucked on a highway to nowhere right now and it is only getting worse on this planet. I was born 1995 before Gameboy got color and as we evolved through technology it feels to me that we have devolved as beings. Shit I myself am piece of work and I work hard. It took a lot to be this decent I literally dealt with years of darkness and still do but I do not want to kill anyone or destroy the world... I used to though. Honestly I think everyone is capable of anything if they put their mind to it but you must be willing to continue.Information is key you have to be willing to grow. You must apply information to effort no matter how fast or slow. The snail does not know where the fuck it is going and its not even capable of high speeds but that fuckers moving. Being poor being stagnant these are mindsets. Set your mind to something else. Knowing your situation is half the battle the rest is faith baby. The odds of any of this existence bullshit do not exist infinitesimal. Which means you are already beating the odds. Keep fucking fighting do not quit. This is for me as much as it is for whoever reads.I hope you equalstand... the better you are the better I am the better we can be to eachother that is better people on the planet making things a slightly better place. it is those who know the darkness that shine the brightest. Be brave. The time is always now. Do with that info what you will. I hope reddit does not remove this. I hope it touches someone. You are not alone in your suffering there are others there is hope you are a good enough reason to continue. You are a great enough reason to be better. Blessings upon you from a stranger Hyiding. There is nothing wrong with me,Depression
26881,26901,I just realised I wrote more than I meant sorry for that.. but thank you for being here anywaysWhere do I begin.. I am technically currently a university student but I may not be for much longer I have been at my university for 3 years took a foundation year and I have just failed year 1 again. it is been awful my 1st year went fine ish but in my 2nd year I was depressed still am and it really messed up my studying and my social life. I got a 2nd chance to retake the year and the university made me take counselling with their councillor and I was on antidepressants but I failed again. Which leaves me where I am now. I currently do not know if I have been kicked out yet or if the university will give me a 3rd chance. In the last year I think I probably have gotten addicted to alcohol and a couple months ago a stopped taking my antidepressants without my doctor knowing. Now I have no idea what is going on or what I am doing my parent has no idea about any of this. They think I will graduate next year. I know their views on mental health and its not worth trying to talk to them about it. I have lost my passion for anything I used to love and I have felt my emotions start to numb.I have not spoken to my doctor in a while because it always feels like I am being overdramatic about what I am saying. A year ago I applied for a test to see if I was on the Autistic spectrum and it seems as if I am even though I still have not heard anything. But so often I have trouble sitting still and there a parts of my day or even whole days that pass me by and it seems as if I do not remember it or as if i was not thinking as those times past me by so I want to talk to my doctor about these things like ask if I have Anxiety or if I have ADHD but I do not want to be that person that just thinks every little thing is a disability.I have just realised I have written much more than I meant I am so sorry for that. I will just leave it there. Its all gone bad,Depression
26892,26912,I spend a lot of my life feeling small and insignificant. I do not have a good relationship with my mother and I do not have a lot of friends.I got sick and I had to take sick leave from my job in March. My employer knew this and texted me to ask if I would be back after a the Easter break. I texted her back at the time to say no I would not be able unfortunately. She did not reply and when I got some doctors visits over I texted again to confirm I would be unfit for work through the rest of the teaching year I am a primary school teacher. Left on read again.Well pay day came recently and I got nothing. I emailed pay roll to ask and they told me the school has not submitted my sick leave paperwork since May. I am fairly sure the person I was substituting for came back. They did not even tell me. I emailed the school to enquire and lo and behold I was ignored again .It broke me more than anything has in a while. I am just so disposable to everyone. I am finding it hard to cope with how insignificant and disposable I am to everyone. My employer is the straw that broke the camel's back.,Depression
26924,26944,For all of us neglected and alone today try to stay off Facebook to look at your supposed ex friends or exes posts I just found out my exes daughter is friends now with his new loves hairdresser who introduced him to her before our divorce. why would she be friends with her? Her own marriage is failing and I hope it does so she can see what it feels like Seems like everybodys having a big old circle jerk as I sit in my room all by myself in the dark 4th,Depression

26999,27019,So for the past like 3 years I have been getting episodes of feeling extremely bored no interest in anything tiredness etc and it pops up around springsummer and it goes away for a while then it pops up later in the year again. Why and what can I do agains it? I probably do not get the daily recommended sunlight as I work inside all day then I do not really get out much after I get home on weekdays. Worth mentioning is that I am an avid gamer when I am really feeling it I can play all day and have fun but when I am in these periods I can barely bring myself to launch anything. Periodic depression?,Depression
27002,27022,I just worry that even if I get a better life I still will not be happy. I will still be just as miserable as I am now. Even if I had a reason to feel joy or just be ok with what was happening I would not be and I would know that at that point it would be all over. I would be beyond repair. I already feel way older than I am and I just want to have lived a full life already. It could have been a horrible life as long as I was older and closer to the end. As long as I could be less tired or at least have a reason to be tired. I am scared things will get better.,Depression
27013,27033,By all reasonable metrics my life is absolutely fantastic. I work as a software developer which I love or well loved have worked at a very large well known software company and now work at essentially my dream job at a quickly growing and very successful startup. I am married have 100k in cash savings and more in investments. I am only 3 years out of college but I have 10 years of actual development experience and supposedly am one of the best performers in the places I have worked.However I absolutely detest my life. I have no joy in anything. Video games that would be enjoyable now are just the easiest way to distract myself from feeling terrible but I do not actually feel like I have enjoyed the time spent. For the most part I never did anything outside of work either I would browse Reddit try to play a game or just sit around. I would occasionally go on bike rides or walks but I have never been a very outdoorsy person I am allergic to everything and have exercise induced asthma. Exercise never seemed to help me feel better or sleep anyway. Life became a very dull cycle of wakeup work constantly wait for work to be over sit around constantly wait and dread work starting etc...I am constantly extremely tired and I wake up quite often in the night. My various doctors have taken me through 5 depression and 6 sleep medications in the past year or so and none have brought much relief. I have had two sleep studies that not only turned up nothing but left the doctors telling me that it looked like I slept fine. I have trouble even taking naps so while I am constantly fighting to keep my eyes open I will not actually fall asleep in most cases which becomes very wearing and boring.I am or was typically a very passionate motivated person. I was always reading stuff to learn was very dedicated in school was always thinking of side projects to work on etc... I started a medical leave from work a month ago because I could not handle starting work each day. Since then I have felt no motivation to do anything and an extreme dread at the idea of returning to work. I liked writing software my team was great but I was always sitting there waiting for my 8 hours to be up so I could go home and be sad when I do not accomplish anything.ampx200BIt seems like such a poor career choice to just outright quit a job with no plan but I honestly do not know what else I can do. I suppose I can force myself to go back to work and just keep going through the days but I honestly think I cannot take that. If I ever get better I should be able to find another job without much trouble but this was my dream job and I am considering giving it up just because I am weak. I am also considering burning savings which although it should last for quite a while seems foolhardy.Is there anything you would suggest that may be a better course of action? Help me justify or condemn these ideas as I do not have anyone besides my wife who really understands my predicament. Extremely burnt out at 25. Considering quitting job and taking an extended break,Depression
27019,27039,I add the question mark I am not sure if that is what this is I am I guess addicted to workingprogression Anytime Iv been single or my wife leaves me alone i do not think there related but having someone is calming I have to work I have workout I have to study I cannot relax my brain is crunching numbers or I am doing something I feel guilty and best myself for enjoying too much coffeesnacks or not maximizing my hours I must have a fit body I must have a strong education I must have high earning nothing less is acceptable a sleep minimum hours too maximize my time 46 hours I cannot even be proud of myself Ill just obsess over my breaks 20 minute break why was not in 510 minutes I am losing progress why not find a way to work and eat I guess I am just looking to talk about seems to help relax me I do not like stressing my wife High functioning Anxiety?,Depression
27020,27040,she is a very nice person and I did not want her to get hurt when I go away. I told my only friend not to talk to me anymore.,Depression
27027,27047,Hi everyone I am 32 year old male currently dealing with depression. Majority of my life I have been dealing with OCDAnxiety mostly focused on having a serious illness. The constant worrying has put me in what i think is a serious deep depression. I have no emotion anymore. Nothing excites me i feel like I am just existing. I got engaged 2 months again and was not nervous no excitement no emotion i feel like i do not have emotion for much anymore. It honestly scares me. I been to psychologists and CBT never really helped.Thinking that i might need to go see a psychiatrist i feel like I am drowning here and i cannot get out its an awful feeling. I have start going back into work july 12 so that means 230 hour commute to the city one way. So my question is what have you done to help get out of this depression and if anyone deals with health anxiety what do you do. I feel like the health anxiety is what put me in the state. I worried for 2 months thinking i had skin cancer to get a biopsy and it was a mole and now i feel like there is a lump in my neck and the worse part about that is no one else feels it i went to urgent care and the doc said nothing is there. i keep making doc appointments thinking they miss something I am trying to save for a wedding and I am just spending money on docs. Please help. I need help but IDK where to begin.,Depression
27045,27065,i have been better for a few months and i have been feeling myself slipping back into a depressive episode again. I am not there just yet but i can feel myself getting worse from week to week and i do not know what to do about it. I am doing everything i was doing when i started to get better before. i am taking my anxiety meds which is good but i see that my depression is coming back. at the end of my last depressive episode i journaled about my feelings i did meditation at night to fall asleeep and i forced myself to do hobbies i used to like and go out with my friends. that took a lot of energy but i did come out of that depressive episode. i still do journaling and i go out with my friends. ill start doing meditation at night again but i still feel like shit. i feel like i am slipping and i do not know what to do about it i hate this hopeless feeling. i just wish i could crawl into a corner and come back out in a few months when ill be feeling better. feeling yourself slipping,Depression
27074,27094,I have been dealing with depression from my teenage years and got prescribed medication when I was 12. I was living with my grandma at that point and she thought I was tricking the doctor and was proud of me for doing such a good job at appearing sad. I was not faking it. My family were never big on mental health and its only recently that I got to discuss it with my mom. I am in college now and have been going to therapy for the past 2 years. Therapy is fine. I mostly attended the sessions when I was not having an episode so basically I have not attended one in the past 6 months. I mentioned how I started being more open with my mother about how I was feeling she helped me pay for a trip to visit a friend. I was there for a month helped a lot. I was ok for the two weeks after I got home and now Its back to square 0. I feel ungrateful. I had a chaotic childhood growing up and it made sense how I was feeling then. It does not make sense how I am feeling now. I am surrounded by people I care for and doing the job I love studying the shit I could give my life for. But instead I waste my time either eating or sleeping because they are the only two things I have energy for. Getting off my bed to go play a f videogame is the highlight of my day. I have friends inviting me to go out but looking at myself in the mirror I do not think anyone should see me at this point. I cannot see myself so why do I expect others. This is not how people know me. I am a workaholic. I am an extrovert. The friendly person that cleans up helps and does shit to make my mom proud. Right now I am just an ungrateful disappointment of a child. This has been written after two hours of banging my head against any surface crying for someone to make it stop. I feel like a disappointment,Depression
27109,27129,Another summer that i do not do anything another summer that i got to work in a job that i hate. For how much longer i would live like that? I never do what i want because i cannot because this job does not give the Money and the free time that i need but i cannot do otherwise. Fuck i am 25 and i have not done anything in my life and at this point i know that i will not do anything. I do not have dreams anymore whenever i dreamed about anything it became nightmare instantly.this is really the last powers that i got in my mind and body. I do not have any reason to keep going i really do not. For how much longer?,Depression
27118,27138,i do not know why am i depending on emotional support so much when i literally grew up without them i mean i lived without it for so long and yet its the very reason that hits me hardalso i know that this subreddit is super supportive and all but idk nothing beats people you know irl and this whole healing journey adulting in general is so freaking lonely and the way i push ppl away and get defensive eventually gets me later fmlidk i just feel miserable with everything and to make it worse in this pandemic with the never ending lockdowns ii do not know bestie if you have some light pls help me its depressing how much emotional support i need to feel enough,Depression
27151,27171,I am a bubble floating through a vast empty void. I do not know what to do. I wake up every day and do the exact same thing. I feel a heavy force pulling me deeper into my home. The anxiety I feel over thoughts of leaving my fortress gives me physical pain. I have no purpose to move in any direction except back and forth. I sometimes feel that I am losing grip on reality. I feel consumed by the screens in front of me. Dependent on them for warmth. I write to myself every day just like this. Today I decided to allow the public to digest my psyche. Perhaps to give me a better understanding of myself through unbiased eyes. I am gripped with fear. There is a xenomorph hammering my inner chest plate. Please do not judge me harshly. I am always alone. I should clarify I have an elusive partner. My partner is an alcoholic drug user with a gambling addiction. They are also a hell of a go getter with a can do attitude. Observance prevents me from assimilation. Sex is a drug purchased with guilt. We have brief moments together where we exchange pleasantries before going about our days.They have a demanding job but are payed sufficiently well all things considered. I do not have a job. I have had jobs. Too many jobs. I counted once. 22 I believe. My plethora of different career paths has been both a blessing and a curse. I am well read with a variety of skills. I feel consistently overlooked. I am average height. I feel my partner has resigned themselves to the inevitable descent into drinking alone at the video poker machines. We are both 32. My partner is well liked in the community. I am a shadow. I make the rare appearance at a function or two. I typically do not eat. My choice to eat or not to eat will be my martyrdom. I have not pinpointed why my body has become the offering. Although I can provide a generous list of options. People seem to enjoy my company and compliment me on my looks and body. I am clean well dressed and have been told I have an intimidating presence. I hold a conservation well and have good comedic timing in the moment. My jokes are dry. Much to my dismay I am not a large person. I am frail. I feel myself diminishing. My soul is drifting towards the event horizon. My partner and I played jeopardy once. The fight lasted for a week. I question my memories. When I speak of fortnight's passed my words are taunted belittled questioned or worst of all... Ignored. A victim chooses to be a victim. The poor choose to be poor. The path was paved for a different vehicle yet only I am to blame if I cannot pass. The fault is mine. My mind drifts through consciousness. Nicotine and constant vigilance vibrate through my sleepless body. My fears are desperate for attention. I exist only for brief entertainment when all else fails. I am the sideshow to a sideshow at a zoo. My only solace is found by translating thoughts into little notes that I leave for myself. Even now I question the weight of my words. My screams are yawns to the deaf. Wailing is no use when I am trapped in a bubble floating through a void.Please advise. Please advise.,Depression
27162,27182,Its so sad. I am only happy when I am at work. I absolutely love my job but on my days off I am gutted with loneliness. I love being around people but because of the work laws I cannot pick up work everyday. Today I am trying to desperately to pick up a shift but there is nothing. I begged people to swap me. I need other hobbies and friends outside of work. I hate not working,Depression
27180,27200,My life fucking sucks to put it simply constant pain all over everyday now I have got covid and been isolating 6 days its getting to me I have started hurting myself i need to get out my room but I cannot i just do not know if i can carry on i hate myself I just want to die,Depression
27191,27211,Just tired of everything. Of my family life. My lack of friends and a s.o. I am far from where I wish I was at life at this stage. I am just done. I wake up every morning wish I had not woken up.,Depression
27204,27224,i just lay here amp feel so sad i feel awful every day,Depression
27216,27236,Hey so I have posted a few places for support but no community has given me any so I am trying here.Backstory I have always struggles with depression and intrusive thought usually brought on by my father who is verbally abusive. He likes turning anything good to something negative. About me I am 20 this year and studying I moved out of parent's place and was doing so good until Covid decided to make us poor so I had to go back to my parents. I have been diagnosed with depression and bipolar and am pretty familiar with when to know a manic episode is coming but my depression just hits me low.All my colleagues always call me floaty because I am happy and chill by nature. I never fight and always ignore drama and conflict. Here I get to the pointMy family was recently attacked by a neighbor and my dad defended us by stabbing him so he went to jail for bail. In that time my mom and I were alone and living peacefully without problems or drama but my dad was suffering in jail and we kept on working to fairly get him out so he was the victim. I was really worried about my dad coming home because he is always been very negative and makes anything a problem. He came back a nice modest man who is grateful for everything. This however lasted only a week and once again everything in my home is cold and dark. We had a party and one of the guests accidentally packed his phone in when leaving. My dad went crazy accusing her of theft and screaming at us even though I got the phone back immediately. I had a panic attack due to all the screaming and anger.Today nobody in the house is talking everything is tense.I am just depressed and disappointed. I have been crying and nothing is happy anymore. The whole situation just completely through me of while I had been stable and happy till now.We have an apartment by the beach where I want to flee since I can still have online class from there and my workplace allows me to travel since we serve the whole country so I can go there and still work and study without any additional moving or trouble Problem is that our country has some limits on traveling between states right now however the apartment there is on my name and I could say I am going home.Should I stick it out at home or try to go? I know I cannot reject my father because his fragile yet his behavior is affecting my mental health. What would you do in this situation? External Factors harming recovery,Depression
27231,27251,I need F 30 some advice on how I can reach out to my friends after being distant for a few months. let us call them friend A and B. In December 2020 I started getting really depressed due to a highly stressful job the fact that for the first time ever Id be spending Christmas alone covid lockdowns family far away and finding out that a close family member has cancer. For New Years I went to friend As house and she asked me about my relative and the cancer treatment but I kept getting interrupted while other people in the background were making jokes and my friend was not really listening. She was like Oh sorry you were saying go onI was feeling highly sensitive and about to cry but she was not listening to what I had to say. I felt shut down but I was not going to let this be a reason for getting mad at her. Now friend B I have known most of my life almost 20 years. We wished each other happy New Years and I asked her when she is free to FaceTime. Again I was a wreck just spent Christmas alone had intrusive thoughts about my relative. I really needed to talk to her. I get that Christmas time is busy but she got back to me around Jan 13 we can FaceTime tomorrowThat was 2 weeks later and in those 2 weeks my mental health declined even more. At this point I did not even feel like texting her back right away. I texted her a few days later and admitted that I am in a bad headspace and Ill FaceTime her in a few days. But I did not. My mental health kept getting worse I was not taking care of myself skipped showers I was binging on unhealthy foods not exercising had insomnia headaches neglected to take care of things around the house. And I could not stop crying. Id cry soon after waking up while driving to work Id cry on my lunch breaks and when I got home. I started developing intrusive thoughts thinking what is the point of it all how I hate the way my life turned out etc.Things got REALLY bad. Friend A and B texted me on my birthday end of Feb and it took me days to even read the messages and text back. Everything even the smallest tasks took so much effort. Literally on my birthday I kept getting messages from people and I wanted to throw my phone out the window. It was not a happy birthday. I was at work and on my lunch break went for a drive to get a coffee and again started bawling my eyes out. I thanked them for the wishes and did not say anything else. Now fast forward to mid March its friend Bs birthday. I wished her a happy birthday but she never texted back.Which I understand. My lack of communication could have been taken the wrong way as I never explained to them what I was truly going through. I think about my two friends all the time and I wish I had not fucked up our friendships. I want to reach out and apologize but I do not even know where to start. Were now in JulyI was basically a ghost for 6 months. I never suffered from such deep depression in my whole life it was so bad that even the smallest tasks took a lot of effort. I become so isolated desperately tried to work on myself. But it takes time. You cannot get better over night. Only now i am starting to feel like myself again not 100 back to normal yet but getting there. How can I fix friendships after isolating myself due to depression?,Depression
27244,27264,At 30 years old I am still lagging behind in finding a job making friends being mature... I am trying to accept that I am in need of a lot of development but I am not sure how to do it. Like what happens to the bad guy after they decide they want to be better? How exactly does one mature? I feel like the villain of my own life,Depression
27253,27273,HiI am 30 have a great paying job amazing friends and family the best partner I could ask for single handedly set myself up for the rest of my life though hard work and had no traumatic or disruptive upbringing to speak of. Yet depression and anxiety continue to get the better of me. I feel selfish to feel this way when people have experienced hardships and have genuine reasons to feel this way. What is wrong with me? Does anyone else feel this way?Thank you for reading. I feel selfish for being depressed.,Depression
27258,27278,So long story short I have MDD GAD BPD. Since late 2020 depression has been kicking my arse. I have suffered with depressive episodes for over 12 years but never this bad or long. My last depressive episode was after the birth of my son and had great success with the 2nd SSRI I tried and managed to establish a good routine to get me out. I am currently on my 7th antidepressant and have been sectioned twice this year for SI with intent. Its marginally better than it was but its getting worse again. Zero motivation to get out of bed no appetite crying etc.I am also doing intensive group therapy since February which I am really invested in but t the end of the day I feel I have exhausted all options Is there any way out without ending it?,Depression
27285,27305,Book wise movie wise music wise... what soothes you or makes you feel less desperate when you are in a bad mental space? what media helps you when you are depressed?,Depression
27295,27315,I do not want to live anymore. I am 16 and everything in my life sucks.My parents have been divorced for years we moved across countries my father started a new family and when he heard that I do not see his family as my family he sent me off to a therapist. I have got absolutely no support in anything from anyone. When I grow up I want to be a musician but my parents do not like that Idea at all. They also play the victim card on me all the time and when I confront them about their parenting they turn it around on me. sorry this is so messy I could get into much of this stuff I just know no one cares and has the time to read so much. I just do not want to continue living. I am so tired of trying. there is no point in anything. I have never felt this way in my life but there is just no getting around it.1 day ago I was about to kill myself when I realised I do not want to. And truth is I do not want to die i just do not want to live anymore I do not know if anyone understands what I am saying. I just want time to freeze forever. I am out of options I do not know what to do. I am posting this here because why the f not and I have never even talked about this to anyone. I mean I talk about stuff like this with my therapist but I do not even have motivation to keep on going to him. it is probably due to my family saying that only weak people go to therapists and that I do not need him... But they are the ones who sent me to the therapist??I know this is like really bad writing but I do not know anymore. Through my life I have had so many issues and always tried to face them but without any motivation from anyone around me I just do not know what to do. I am incredibly sad. I just do not want to.,Depression

37877,37874,throwaway account for privacy reason i just graduated with an advanced degree and got into job search i ve been struggling with depression for year and i think at first it wa the high functioning kind but in the last few year it seemed to have turned to the demotivational kind of depression i m tired all the time and i always pick the easy thing to do easy entertainment watch thing mindlessly easy way to go to sleep scroll on my phone until i m too tired to stay awake etc it come and go in wave too sometimes i d get the energy to do thing or to do something along the line of self improvement other time i would just want to sleep i ve learned that some thing trigger depressive episode much faster than others but i m not sure how to let these trigger pas without the episode full on hitting me for instance one of the trigger is a perceived sense of being excluded from thing or being rejected or being shown or told that i m not good enough can you tell that i suffer from an inferiority complex anyway today that trigger came from one of my tennis group friend who wanted to set up a play session every two week for advanced player in our amateur tennis group this doesn t conflict with any of our other scheduled play session and i know that i m not good enough to be in the advanced group all of my tennis friend are good people and i know that there s always going to be room in the advanced group for people who improve and get to that level even knowing all this i got so depressed over the span of about minute that i just stopped functioning i think that since this group of friend ha been my only real support for the last few year anything that happens in the group that i see a a rejection of myself just instantly take me down now that i m in the middle of it it feel like the only thing i can do is wait for it to pas because talking out of it or building myself up don t work when all i can think about is how i ve failed everything and that i ve never and will never live up to anyone s standard including my own sorry for the long selfish post i m struggling daily with imposter syndrome and a sense of inadequacy the trigger just happened to be this particular thing today,Depression

38258,38255,i m at a very weird place in my life right now i m a year old male in college i m failing my college class a i have no motivation to do well in them i have a very poor relationship with my parent and family the one organization in my college that i m extremely involved with ha cut tie with me over accusation that are not true i have a leadership role in this organization and being a leader in the organization with no prior experience ha brought me a ton of hater and people that just want to see my downfall i literally have no future a i m supposed to graduate this semester and get a job but i am nowhere near both i can t pursue my real passion and to top it all of and what really might put me over the edge is problem with this woman in my life we met through this organization that i wa talking about earlier in this text a a captain i have my own committee of people that i oversee and she wa one of my committee member the first time we hung out in october she took me out to a bar after i turned it wa just me and her we quickly started to develop this really cool friendship where d we hangout and talk almost daily a a young man hopeless in love i started to develop feeling but nothing crazy because i almost always saw her a a best friend first and i m sure she felt the same way then we were at a bar about a month ago she wa talking to some guy at the bar and i wa having a funny conversation with my friend but i could see from the corner of my eye that she wa talking to this man and that s when i first started feeling these feeling of jealousy but i could tell she wa looking at me too talking to my friend and she came to me and we embraced and i hugged her almost all night had my arm around her and everything and she had her hand over mine too and we just kept feeling each other this wa the first time we ever moved into this phase of our friendship and i think we both felt something brewing in our heart for one another a few day went by and i wa out yet again talking to this other chick i met at the bar and we ended up almost hooking up back at my place but i couldn t go through with it because all i could think about wa my best friend who i really liked i m an introvert at heart and will always keep my feeling inside because i m scared to tell people how i feel and i suppress those feeling but literally the next day after this hookup that didn t happen i wa at a friend s st birthday party and got hammered myself and i had this urge of wanting to tell my best friend how i truly felt about her and that s exactly what i did it wa a thursday night she always go to this one specific club on thursday night so i ditched my friend and went to that club to see her and it literally played out like a romantic film she wa the first person i saw when i walked in and went up to her and for the first time in my life i poured my heart out to her and told her how i felt about her and how she make me feel and at first she wa shocked and then she said she felt the same way and we kissed for a long time at this moment i wa on cloud 9 i had never had a girlfriend before had never been in a relationship before but in this moment it wa just me and her against the world and i loved it we started to head back to my apartment but the alcohol wa kicking in for me and i passed out once i got back to my apartment i woke up the next day and saw her heel on the floor but she wa nowhere to be found so i texted her and told her that i wa sorry for passing out from the alcohol but i meant every word i told her last night she didn t text me back till later that day and she said that she wa thinking about it all day and night and she didn t want to fuck up our friendship a it s one of the few good thing in her life right now and i totally get that wa i disappointed hearing this yeah of course i wa but i texted her back saying that we can talk about this in person another time but for right now enjoy your weekend the next day we saw each other at a party and i talked to her outside and told her that i d rather say we tried to make it work and it didn t rather than not giving u a chance at all and she never gave me a clear answer she texted me later that night saying that she needed a break and some time to think so i said okay a few day later we had our last committee meeting and it wa so awkward cause we hadn t talked before and we were on this so called break and after the meeting ended she immediately left even though she usually wait for me i got a text from her later that night around am saying that this letter i wrote for everyone on my committee wa very sweet and cute and i asked her how long this break should last and she said she wasn t sure a she didn t want me to think that she wa leading me on which i thought she wa doing so we hopped on this facetime call and had a really nice long conversation about all the stuff we had to catch up on and then after an hour i switched the topic back to our relationship and she basically said that she didn t feel the same way i wa so hurt when she said this because all the sign pointed to her liking me too and i really felt like i knew what her heart wa saying we both went to sleep cry that night for each other the next day i sent her a text this time saying that i do need some space to figure thing out and we can talk after spring break so for the next week we didn t talk she didn t view my story like any of my social medium post and just simply didn t communicate with each other and it wa one of the worst thing for me to go through a she wa someone i really looked forward to talking to and to not be able to do that just sucked the sunday before we came back to college i texted her and asked if she d be down to hangout that first week we got back and she said she wa down to do so and i wa so happy because it felt like i wa getting my friend back again but then a few day later she angrily text me asking if i told anyone that we hooked up which isn t true and i told her that i didn t which is true there were rumor going around about u from people that saw u hangout a lot that saw u embrace at the bar that saw u kiss at the club and saw u walk back to my apartment together so people could only assume that we were a thing and i kept telling her that but she wasn t having it she facetimed me saying that she regretted ever kissing me she didn t want to be friend anymore and all this shit i wa extremely hurt hearing this and just wanted my friend back and wanted to forget ever opening up my feeling for her so i sent her a really long text explaining that i never said anything that i really cared about her and just wanted my best friend back she responded by saying that she appreciated me reaching out and that she wa over the situation and that she s not ready to move forward with me and doesn t think our friendship will ever be the same so i texted her this morning and i said i get it and if there wa any way we could meet in person and just talk she responded back by saying that she s potentially open to it but not now maybe next week so i said i just genuinely need someone to talk to but i understand her the last text she sent me wa i don t think i can be that person for you anymore i m sorry i am heartbroken devastated and hopeless angry at myself angry at this world and i just want to leave i have no direction in life no one to turn to anymore and i just want to end it all a soon a possible,Depression

38651,38648,i have been suffering for eight long month after a girl i thought would be interested in being my girlfriend ended thing and left me out to dry it wa a pretty short span of dating and hooking up we talked during the summer and only saw each other in person for a few week but the aftermath ha been the worst thing i ve ever gone through in my entire life i have alienated myself from her because i couldn t stop texting her and asking what i did wrong or saying thing i thought i did to make her not interested and expect her to confirm i am on a no contact basis with her now which is probably for the best because i don t think she even cared that much about me to begin with i can t handle the fluidity of dating how people can just leave something if it isn t working out for them for whatever reason and not know what that reason is i ve already come up with every possible situation or reason in my head that it didn t work out and it s honestly been driving me over the edge since last summer i can t take this anymore luckily it s never gotten so bad that i threatened her with suicide because i remember her saying she had an ex who did that to her and it sound like an awful thing to have done to you but that thought did cross my mind where i wanted to present that a an ultimatum to her if she couldn t just tell me what the exact reason or reason were she wanted to end it but i would never actually do that due to it being shitty to put another person through it s not enough for me to accept that we lived more than three hour from each other or she had a bad long term relationship end and wasn t trying to get into anything serious or she told me she wa feeling suffocated by me it s like the spongebob episode with patrick s secret box i just want so badly to hear what it might have been like she would tell her girl friend behind closed door no matter how bad it might sting or hurt but i know i ll never know precisely what she wa thinking it is so difficult to just move on or let it go like people always say for dating situation like this that to me just sound impossible i just hate dating i hate how some people have such ease jumping from date to date or going on multiple date with multiple people at once or talking to many people at one time it just make me feel so overwhelmed and upset that that seems to be the norm in society i can t take it it make me want to die just knowing that s what i m going to have to deal with if i want to have any hope of finding someone to be with let alone get over this last girl,Depression
38653,38650,i m feeling every day more drained not only i have to deal with a job i hate but also my anxiety doesn t make it any better i dread going to work it s like all day i m imagining how tiring it s gon na be the day after it s a vicious cycle i can t seem to get out of what s more troubling it s that i ve never could do anything meaningful with my life to improve my situation i don t have any remarkable skill or something that can allow me to find a better job i feel such a loser don t know how much i m gon na be able to resist this these past two year since the pandemic started also made matter worse i m depressed almost all the time i don t feel like going out meeting with friend going to the movie nothing it s like everything it s piling up on me a few month ago i took the step of starting to follow some online course to gain skill that allow me to find a better job but it feel like i m never gon na make it i have negative thought constantly which lead me to believe i m gon na fail my anxiety also doesn t allow me to find a therapist i had a bad experience in the past that left me kinda scarred in this regard and now just finding professional help feel like a daunting task i m so lost what would you do thanks for reading,Depression
38665,38662,so i have a mild stutter and i just had an epiphany i ve been letting my stutter control me but i found something amazing out i let my stutter define who i wa a a person instead of an aspect of myself it s so bad that when my parent talk to me like a normal person i d think to myself wow they act like i m normal despite my stutter they see past that and when i would work people would see my name tag and say oh i have a son named my name and i would think he probably doesn t stutter tho i let this define who i wa a a person and i let it really get to me i wa looking at old reddit post from other people asking how people view stutter and most people said they didn t care at all and even found it interesting some even said it wa hot cute made joke sound more natural and a a result more funny not like they found the stutter funny tho and one even said they were turned on by it and someone said something that stuck out to me they pretty much said how you perceive yourself is how others will so if i see myself a weird and anxious i will act that way and be perceived in that way but if i see myself a confident and charismatic and just act like my stutter doesn t bother me and even joke about it then others will perceive me a such this blew my mind a i thought everyone didn t pick up on my stutter at first and just thought i wa super weird but it s just me convincing myself of that so even tho this clicked i still can t just flick the switch off so how do i actually become confident with my stutter it s very mild and is fueled by anxiety so if i can get rid of my anxiety it ll in my opinion make me sound more charismatic and confident so i really wan na figure out how to just own it how do i do this,Depression

39087,39084,hi i m f and my partner guy is also i say partner because i ve had mixed message about being in a relationship or not recently with him and i think this is a factor to my anxiety too fyi i have had bad anxiety since an abusive relationship at university and another one where i had a bf cheat multiple time my parent did not have a healthy relationship when i wa younger and where both not very present till my later teenage year i don t suffer anxiety in general but my relationship anxiety ha only got worse the older i get current situ we ve been dating month about week ago his twin brother died suddenly which wa tragic accident they were extremely close and he s been very unemotional about it all hasn t cried and been very rational before we got together we were friend before although i always knew he wanted more than that he d asked me on a few date in the past which i declined because he isn t usually someone i would go for but personality win me over everytime he wa also very consistent over text and the quality of conversation wa always really good which a someone with r anxiety the reassurance that someone is interested really help and usually attracts me more to them this ha since faded massively even before the passing of his brother and i find even some day the conversation is a 0th of what it used to be we ve discussed this and a lot of the time he say it s due to work and just over time not needing to keep up this same level because he is no longer chasing me because of my anxiety the long period of lack of communication i struggle with and my brain start to panic i find myself regularly checking his instagram who he follows what picture he s liked it s not healthy and i m trying to stop because it never help but almost become like an ocd since his brother passed he s shown me glimpse of seeing a future together he introduced me to some friend double date and his parent sister which i don t feel you would do if you didn t see a relationship potential he s said he would have asked me to be his gf when we should have gone on holiday the week after his brother passed but since i ve had mixed comment from whether we are in a relationship or still dating i find myself in a constant spiral atm due to the lack of communication which he say a factor is the grieving this is hard to overcome i feel awful to keep bringing up i need more in this situation i e if he can t text due to busy day can he call me more he agrees but never follows through consistently so every week i m cycling the anxiety cry worry that s now affecting my work and day to day in this situation i don t know what to do the anxiety is becoming worse and worse i don t want to have to keep bringing it up to him because of everything going on in his personal life but he doesn t seem to be meeting any emotional need for me and i m worried i won t cope long term with someone who can t reassure me i also feel guilty for wanting more from him i do hope it will get better in time a he is still in shock grieving process but it s hard to tell how would you handle this situation do you continue to suffer in silence with the anxiety in order to stop putting pressure on the other person when they are grieving or would ending the situation be better i wouldn t want to do this i m very happy with him but i feel like in a short space of time this ha been intense and draining,Depression

39519,39516,hey so i feel cringe posting this and will likely delete but sometimes just venting and writing thing out is rlly calming and therapeutic this is my first post here but i ve lurked for a few year now and always read other people s story when im feeling down and alone which help sometimes background before getting into this i have gad and major depressive disorder and have been on ssri since 0 my dad side of the family all tend to have the same issue just on a way le of a scale i am awful at articulating my thought and it s insanely frustrating just a head up before getting into the incoherent vent post i m just gon na be listing a bunch of different thing that have been bothering me i am soon to be i am absolutely petrified of turning 0 and i have 0 accomplishment in life i still live with my parent i work a shitty job paying hr i have 0 motivation or drive to want to pursue anything like a better job meeting new people getting into a relationship etc i sit in my dark dimly lit room all day and play game watch twitch stream all of my friend are moving on and having kid and getting their own place and embracing adulthood with open arm i seem to be the only one that is incapable of making this transition i want to be a kid again i want the simpler time i hate responsibility and expectation i m immature and dumb and don t want to grow up i have a shitty jealous easily angered petty personality that i wa also blessed enough to obtain from my dad side of the family i have never met someone with a personality a petty and insecure a mine ex so i have this friend that applied for a government job that would be really good for her and she d be making good money this is obviously a great thing and i m happy for her but i would be lying if i said i wasn t kinda hoping she got turned down we both currently work shitty job and suffer the same money work struggle i think i just don t want to be left behind and feel like i m alone in my struggle i feel so shitty that i m even thinking this way i also have an ego that i rlly shouldn t have considering im an ugly short bald year old that peaked in highschool idk if it s undiagnosed narcissism or what but i know something is wrong because of this i am most of the time an awful friend i ve gotten better over the year because i gained some self awareness before though i would burn a lot of bridge i wa getting into argument with irl friend and internet friend weekly man i used to be such a bully to my little brother growing up too and i cringe every time i think about it im incredibly grateful every day that i wa able to gain self awareness and a want to change i have anxiety attack and sink into deep hole of depression when faced with the realization i have to work a 9 0 hour work week cuckjob for another 0 year i used to watch twitch stream a an escape but now i can t even do that anymore without having an anxiety attack that i ll never get to live the easy luxurious life that they do wake up whenever they want go to work whenever they want do w e they want for hour and then log off and go do fuck all they can take off whenever they want without the worry of being fired all while making more in year than i will ever make in lifetime of busting my as i understand i m describing like the top of twitch streamer but still i have really awful self esteem and have had for a long a i could remember i used to hate getting picture taken a a kid and would constantly try to hide my face it became a running gag in my friend group that i would never take picture it wa to a point where i wa having anxiety attack just seeing picture of myself there are time when i start to feel better about my appearance but then ill see a picture of myself and immediately get reminded that i m fuckin nosferatu i genuinely think i m incredibly below average and if it wasn t for the fact that i am addicted to working out i might just be the most undesirable man on the planet i would put myself in bottom 0th percentile in look i do think i have some degree of body dysmorphia and it s especially bad right now because im in a panic y state so i am probably overreacting a little about my

when we were together i never lied to her well i only lied about thing and it s about why i tried km when i wa to this day no one know the real reason maybe my friend bc i almost slipped about it i treated her like a queen we lived 0 hour away from each other and i saved up k to go see her when we were together for gas and my dad stayed at a hotel i wa at the time every anniversary i wrote a very long paragraph maybe on why i love her and how beautiful she is at st it wa every sunday of the week we started dating on sunday then the 9th of every month we lasted 0 month together each paragraph wa different and never said the same thing i did this to help make her feel better about herself because she wa ashamed of her body and i could tell she wa depressed i wanted her to be happy i bought her a lot of gift and always asked how her day went btw i m very poor and at the time i mowed lawn to make money 0 a week during spring and summer i m allergic to grass and been doing it since i wa we broke up and she told me because she wa gay but we can still be friend i quit my job month after bc of depression we had a discord server that contained her brother and their friend there wa this guy that we always played with and me her her brother and the guy played doki doki at st he wa nice then when they left he wa very mean to me saying thing like she doesn t like you just leave why are you even trying and so on i never said anything because i didn t want to ruin any friend ship i wish i said something instantly we all played overwatch together also well i tried to stop playing with just him and only play with her i said it wa bc of my anxiety but the real reason wa bc of him month later she stopped talking to me because i still loved her this is where and why i might be gone soon warning i m going to say graphic thing plz know i don t want attention i just want my story to be told if i do leave day my phobia is being alone and she helped me forget a terrible memory when i wa the real reason that no one know about i wa scarred i regret doing all of this i made 0 account on insta saying sorry and emailed her sorry also plz know i regret doing all of this and understand i wa in a dark place still doesn t justify my action some time after that i wa dmed on insta to go km and other horrible thing i tried telling her but she looked at the screen shot and just blocked me then it happened again then again i wa being told to go km and other thing for month straight even wa bullied by her bf at the same time i screen shotted what he said to me also in the middle of all this my mom oded and wa in a hospital for a week i had no one to talk to i tried cry out for help to her no response i tried cry out for help about the guy telling me to km for month no response she is the only able to stop him she never really tried the only ppl who tried to get them to stop wa me and my friend he wa the only help i had on christmas and easter i also emailed her saying i hope her and her family is ok because covid wa bad and her family is like family to me i worry and care about them a lot still wa being told to km and messaged by her bf i started cutting

of what her bf said to me and told them about the person who we still don t know who told me to km later i got a message from her saying that not only she regret our relationship but she is scarred of me and i have to apologize to my friend who wa helping me through all of this btw i don t have the gut to yell at someone bc i ll have a mental break down bc of past trauma parent always yelled at me

doing drug not weed bc the smell make me want to vomit and ill never try it but whippet wa accident but made pain go away so i kept doing it some time later my dad got cancer he s doesn t anymore it got removed right away but while he wa gone i had a bad mental break down and i did a free therapy trail online i forgot the website but i did this with different email so i had session i did it for her bc she always told me to get professional help i got told i might have severe adult separation anxiety i have nightmare every night about losing her still to this day i said a lot more infact i told them everything and they told me that they can t officially diagnose me with it because they wanted to talk to me more but i m poor i can t afford that but i then had no one so i cried for help to her last time i wa scarred her dad texted me to never message he again that night i did a full inhale of whippet and tried to km i had seziure idk how to spell and woke up the next day no one checked in on me i woke up on my floor that wa the last time i ever did that some time later her bf messaged me again it wa a pic of him and her kissing making a heart of their hand he said just give up she doesn t love you and never ha i showed the screen shot to some friend and then deleted it bc it wa painful to look at what am i sopose to do cry for help i can t to this day he message me mocking me but she ll never believe me not only i can t tell her but i don t think she even care i also later found out the real reason why she broke up with me wa bc i wa too clingy not only did my friend tell me this her bf did also everyone who i told this story to tell me she cheated on me that there s no way someone would let this happen if they cared about me after i treated her with respect like that during our relationship i don t think she cheated on me she would never do that i tried going out with other girl but i cant bc it feel like i m cheating on her even tho we re not dating it feel wrong i still love her and i always will even tho she never asked if i wa ok when i wa being told to km which hurt badly i still love her the only reason i m alive is because of my hope

40111,40108,i want to die so bad and i might carry on with it,Depression
40126,40123,i don t know who i am anymore i ve tried so hard to regain a sense of who i once wa but it s pointless everytime i look at someone anybody i instantly feel reminded that i m nothing that i will always will be nothing i m not clueless i know why i feel this way i ve been strong for way too long i ve spent my entire life longing for something that will never come a decent family that isn t problematic friend and a proper support system this entire time i wa never strong because i wanted to be i had no choice but to be i m not a strong person keeping false hope by holding onto delusion to get by isn t what it mean to be strong i know the life i m living now won t last forever but the damage caused by everything i ve gone through is beyond repair i m unfixable my whole life ha been nothing but a buildup of trauma and it ll continue to be it ll never end more than anything i wish someone cared about me would hold my hand and tell me everything s going to be alright hug me when i cry into my pillow at night hold me when i m breaking down because i m not strong enough to take on the pain alone but no i ll never have anyone like that in my life only in my delusional mind if any word defines my life it s alone i ve taken this journey of endless trauma alone none ha ever truly cared everyone just watch me stagger along i wonder why i even wasted any of my time going to therapy none of my therapist have ever cared nothing ever changed i never felt any better i m currently feeling the worst i ve ever felt in my entire life i ve experienced so much pain throughout my whole life but nothing like this this pain destroyed all my dream destroyed who i once wa a a person there s only one way from here now and it s more down then i already am taking medication for my problem isn t what i need throwing pill at my problem isn t going to make me forget about everything that s ever happened in my life the only two thing that would be able to do that for me is severe brain trauma or death i m not going to use drug a mean of coping with my life using drug to solve and help with my problem i may be a worthless individual but i m wise enough to know having to take pill a a mean of getting better isn t the life i want i just need a human being in my life that care about me that is able to see my worth tell me i m more than all of this trauma however i know the reality and i won t sugarcoat it i come with too many challenge for anyone to have any sort of care for me i suffer from skin picking severe depression and anxiety ptsd constant disassociation where i forget who i actually am and feel like the world isn t real i m far too fucked up it explains why i have no friend why i have none in my life who truly care about me because of how long all of my problem have gone untreated i can t escape my suicidal thought my problem will always define who i am will always have the last say in everything i do nothing give me happiness anymore not food not drawing not reading or writing not watching the sunrise not the moon not late night not going outside not sleeping nothing all of it feel pointless now and it doesn t provide me happiness like it used to me i ve always preferred to keep my emotion to myself and not go to my parent for help because everytime i do i get the same response they always invalidate my feeling it s endless response that always tear me down they tell me i m overreacting that i should leave my problem in the past that i should stop being a crybaby that i should grow up already and stop being problematic saying that others have life worse and i shouldn t complain about it there s no point in wasting my time asking them for help i have none else i can reach out to none else that care i wa hospitalized a month ago after i told my school counselor about my suicidal thought what happened my parent were called i wa forced to go to the hospital and i got cussed out badly they said a variety of hurtful thing but what stuck with me the most wa being told that if i were actually suicidal i d have done it already telling me i m nothing but an attention seeker telling me i wasted my time asking for help and going to the hospital because no give a shit about me anyways no care at all for the fact that i m in the hospital because i don t want to live anymore i didn t choose to be open about being suicidal because i m an attention seeker i did it because i needed help surviving if my own parent don t care about me how can i expect anyone else to have any care for me the only living being i have left now is my lovely boy sled he may only be a dog but he s all i have left in this world unfortunately i just don t know if that s enough at this point to keep me going life ha given up on me so i want to give up on myself i m tired of my life consisting of surviving plainly existing without no meaning i don t want be strong anymore i don t want to live in my head anymore i never want to experience trauma ever again i want to escape i want to be free i m not sure if i ll ever get that chance in life and even if i do it won t be anytime soon if i had to guess possibly in a few year but i can t hold on that long hell i don t even know if i can make it to the end of 0 people with proper support system really don t realize how lucky they truly are that s the only that could save me from myself and the only thing i look forward to in the future if i make it the chance i ll have my own support system one of the worst mistake i kept repeating wa thinking that professional help would magically make everything better somehow it didn t i m never taken seriously because to them i m just another mentally ill person that doesn t hold much worth fuck that i do have many mental illness but i m aware and i sure a hell know what my reality is and what s going on i ve recently come to realize you can t rely on anyone but yourself to help you get better obviously this is far from easy when you re suicidal the harsh reality is i can give up or continue living my life in misery this isn t just the harsh reality for me but so many other individual who are suicidal or have suicidal thought or ideation it s not fair at all and none should ever have to come to that realization i feel like i m a lost cause now i m beyond sick and tired of hearing there s hope for the future something brighter to look forward to for the past few year i ve been feeling suicidal all i ve been doing is taking life one step at a time taking it day by day waiting for that one where thing finally start to turn around for me but it hasn t all the time i wonder maybe there s nothing left in my future except loneliness emptiness more nightmare to dream about more tear to shed and more trauma to endure i don t want to live like this anymore although i don t wish to die only escape this life i d rather be dead i don t want to be this aware i don t want to feel like this anymore i don t want the feeling of worrying about what the future hold to consume me anymore being failed by the system failed by society and failed by life is why i m suicidal,Depression

40395,40392,i don t know i don t know i don t know i really really don t know what is going on and i am very confused and afraid for the last year and some change i have not been able to avoid the constant intense desire to violently commit suicide i fight it by trying to think hard about my family and friend and dog and all the good thing in life i have to life for but i am tired of fighting my own brain this hard every single moment of the day there are many many day where it feel like i reach my absolute breaking point and i think i m going to do it but then if i let a couple of hour go by or smoke some weed i feel fine great even but thats the thing i never really know when that s going to end i don t know the next time i ll feel better or the next time i ll feel this low it just kind of hit me and catch me off guard every single time i have always had intense emotional problem even since early childhood and i recall having suicidal ideation at even like or year old i have been diagnosed a bipolar a year ago but i absolutely believe i have a wild case of bpd i have thought that since high school but only in these recent sophomore and junior year of college have the suicidal ideation have become intense urge it feel like i have tried every other option to try to feel happy better but they all either don t work to work for a short time and eventually fail i ve tried therapy last year for the first time thru my school it wa okay they put me on mg abilify and that helped a bit seemed when i wa on the med i would often joke to myself i m glad im on these med because if i wasn t i wa definitely going to kill myself but i dont take them anymore my mother wa very concerned about all the side effect i wa having random spell of fainting or vomiting and heavily encouraged me to get off it and she also mentioned that maybe my emotional problem were intensified by the sudden condition from covid on a teenager well i wa back then and that everyone wa going through a hard time and that made sense to me so i decided to get off it i dont think i ll be able to afford it anyway after college but thats just some side background info there are time i have blanked and scared myself and that s what make me feel like my life is in danger sometimes there wa a time last year during an episode i just started stabbing my arm repeatedly with my cuticle nipper manicure tool thing it broke the skin but they were all obviously very tiny it always scared me looking back because i think if it wa a razor blade or a knife or something it would have killed me i didn t even know what i wa doing my emotion were so strong and i just started doing it there wa another time this year where during another episode i mindlessly drove to target early in the morning to get a fresh pack of razor blade to cut myself with i did not realize what i wa doing until i got all the way back home and wa trying to figure out how to work the razor blade dispenser it just hit me wow did i really just get in my car drive 0 min to target and buy nothing but razor blade to cut myself and maybe kill myself with this is where i worried i wa getting out of control and might actually do it one day i am scared it is soon i don t want it to be but i am scared it might be the urge is so strong there are time i feel no longer in complete control of my action i am scared i am checking the box for someone who is experiencing a mental health emergency but i don t know if i really am or if im just someone who is overdramatic sensitive life inexperienced privileged and attention seeking there are time i fear that i am being attention seeking and being manipulative with my emotion even when i am alone and express them and don t talk to anyone irl about it that confuses me the most but i can never really be sure which lead me to reddit sometimes i think back on my thought if that make sense and look back at previous question i ve asked and don t know if they are normal or not to a degree i know they aren t but i don t know if it s really that bad i am afraid sometimes that if i do kill myself all these thing along with my search history music taste social behavior substance abuse problem shit i ll admit it etc etc are all indicative of someone who is going to kill themselves i look in the mirror and see someone who is going to kill themselves soon i dont want to do it i dont want to do it i always think to myself am i going to be a suicide statistic are these all the inevitable sign and symptom am i about to be one of the of college student to kill themselves this thought distress me very much i have never attempted suicide before i personally know people and read about people online who have but when they describe their emotion i do not really relate to them it seems a though my condition is never really a serious a theirs like i said i ve never officially tried before these people have so it make me think that whatever crazy shit is going on in my head i just need to get over i wish so desperately that i could do that i think i am just emotionally weak you can go back in my post history and see me weird post some i have hidden to avoid ridicule but i don t know how to get them back i notice people around me always ask if i m okay if i ever accidentally share the slightest tip of the iceberg of my feeling with them and the comment i get on reddit post telling me that i should seek professional help immediately i wa looking on my school s counseling website and they have a whole special section for resource for people who might need immediate help am i really one of those people am i experiencing a mental health emergency do i need to be monitored in a hospital there are time i do feel like i am a potential danger to myself but unlike depressed people i at least am able to feel great sometimes when i hear about people who come back from grippy sock vacation i really cringe at that term but thats what everyone around me seems to use they mention their trauma and abuse and i didn t really have it a bad a them i am just sensitive i come to reddit in desperation i have never known how to express my feeling on this without accidentally guilt tripping or manipulating people so i avoid talking about my feeling with people i know irl outside of therapist do i really need help like hospital help is this an emergency it feel like one but is it really please help me tl dr i dont want to kill myself but i a scared that i might or am i just being a weirdo,Depression

47109,47097,I don't wanna try anymore I'm a 25 year old man who's never had a girlfriend or sex in his life and since yesterday I decided to give up trying. I have a very good life amazing family and friends that understand and support me no matter what I do I have a job that I enjoy and coworkers I get extremely well along with. I don't consider myself ugly I think I'm just mid. I nurture many passions am very extroverted and outgoing and I believe I'm quite smart but especially in these last 3 years I've been feeling extremely hollow and sad and the reason why is no matter what I do or how much I keep improving myself I seem to have no luck with girls. Yesterday I went out with this great girl I met in university 2 years ago which I've been texting on and off with. I thought she had interests in me since she was the one asking me out but as I later found out in the day she had been seeing this guy for about a month where she is studying. I promised myself to go into that date with no expectations but of course there was hope things would go well. However as per usual I had to go back home and cry myself to sleep for the 100th time and I'm just tired of this endless repeating cycle.People who've had at least one relationship in their life will never get the pain.,Depression
47123,47111,Please someone help me I lost my mind over a girl. I can't seem to stop thinking about her. All of my friends are choosing her over me. I have no one here to support me.

How do I stop thinking about her. Please anything will help.,Depression

Touch of a skin on my body was triggering happy hormones... Finally i was on receiving end getting nacked in front of someone is kinda of excepting who and what you're no body shaming.It's not an optimal or ethical solution but for time being... I am feeling happy and high sprit.I want to know check with my fallow group members...

47159,47147,I don't know how to cope with my grief I dated someone for over 10 years of my life. My entire 20s. I never loved anyone more. We had a falling out our relationship became toxic and even as we tried to remain friends it didn't work.I cut her off last year at end of januarybeginning of february. I assumed she had moved on and everything and stopped talking to me.Instead...she died. I suspect she took her own life. No one told me. For 13 months I held resentment towards her. I didn't want to be with her but I was upset that she had made our relationship toxic. Instead she was dead. Her family did not tell me. On tuesday her mother called me to tell me the news 13 months later. I am devastated. She did not deserve to die. I am so fucking angry at myself. I knew she was sick I knew she was suicidal and I cut her off anyway. I'm angry at her family for denying me the ability to see her funeral. I'm angry that everyone else got a year to grief together and I am dealing with this loss alone.I didn't message her for an entire year because I was convinced she found someone else and my pride wouldn't allow me to even say hi hope all is well.I feel horrendous.,Depression
47161,47149,Help with new eating pattern!!! Hello all. Thank you for taking the time to listen! I recreantly have been on a weight loss journey and have lost roughly 100 pounds in 3 months. I did this by exercising for a few hours a day and being careful of what I eat or drink. These last two weeks though I have been bingeing and eating like there is no tomorrow. An adventure that is driving me insane and honestly depressed. I still work out and such. During the daytime I am happy and on cloud9 the feeling that anything is possible and the world is my oyster. At night though I get depressed and always have these cravings for sugary food. Even though I do not want the food I end up indulging. I hate myself for doing this. I do not want to go back to being overweight moreso than I currently am. Does someone have any tips or suggestions for my conundrum?,Depression
47169,47157,How do I help my depressed friend? So I 20f became friends with this guy 27m about a year ago. We get along well and talk mostly everyday. Of course there are days when he's not really active and vise versa and I completely understand that. In the past he's voiced not wanting to be alive and it worried me but his mood seemed to lift afterwards. Well recently he started venting about life and told me he's contemplating killing himself. His mom's sick he's the only one supporting his family financially and he's a single dad. I tried to do my best to listen and let him know I'm there for him but I'm still worried about him. I don't feel like anything I'm doing is enough. So I guess my question is how can I best help my friend.,Depression
47184,47172,Even the smallest things hurt I was already having a pretty bad day today feeling depressed and feeling abandoned by people I care about. I figured I'd at least find some comfort in food so I headed to my colleges dining hall buffet and grabbed a box to put some food in for takeout. Well I spotted one of the foods I really like hashbrown casserole but that's not really important and started grabbing myself a decent portion. But with how layered thin it was to get a reasonable portion it would take more scoops because of the thinness. Well I guess one of the workers spotted how much was gone from me scooping n they made jokes with one saying gah damn when looking over at me and his work buddies laughed. One of the others said don't worry about it we're glad u enjoy it and I usually don't care about jokes like that but after the day I had that was the final straw. I finished grabbing my food went to my room n broke down. First time I had cried in months because I was getting better at managing but once everything starts piling up you never know what can be the gum wrapper that topples the pile.,Depression

47209,47195,The soulcrushing loneliness is just too much I have no one to talk to about my struggles. I am completely alone save for the limited social interaction I receive at work and even that is only as much as is professionally necessary. I used to be able to smile and laugh to people but I've been so lonely for so long that it takes everything I have to keep that up anymore. Everyone around me can tell that I'm sad and that just makes me feel all the more unwanted and disdained. The last 2 people I opened up to got so much secondhand stress that they completely shut me out. Every second I'm not at work I'm just sitting in my empty house. There's no joy in anything anymore. There is absolutely nothing to look forward to on a daytoday basis. This all just feels so fundamental that I don't even know where to begin to solve it. There's no real conscious impetus to my actions anymore just listless impulse driving my every thought. The only thing I know for sure in all of this is that every day is the saddest I've ever been.,Depression

47253,47239,I feel things getting bad again For context 2022 was the YEAR of my life. I lived abroad and had a blast. My anxiety was still there but at a minimal. I never felt so happy. So happy at times I felt like I was going to burst. It was insane. February of this year I came back home. Home isn't a good place for my mind. My parents are awful and I always feel like I'm dorwning when I'm home. I've been home since February and I feel things going dark again. I'm sleeping way too much. Have no energy or desire to do anything and the awful thoughts of mot living are coming back. I'm in between places right now. Kicking off a new career that's why I came home. But things are going slow and I cant move away right now. I feel like I was on the bery top of life and now I'm in rock bottom again. I'm lost and confused and my mind keeps things how easy it would all be if I just want living anymore. I dont want to have these thoughts or feel this way.,Depression
47304,47290,Not sure what to do! I have done everything possible! TW This is a new account because I don't want it linked to my old one. I have had quite a lot of awful things happen to me in the last 10 months which most of which I reconise is entirely my fault. I had a miscarriage and was very horribly assulted by a man which caused me to spiral develop an eating disorder take far too many drugs and drink too much cheat on my love of my life and break up with him I got sober and became friends again with my now exbf and I did a lot of healing and now have celebrated 200 days sober. It had been about 56 months and me and my ex boyfriend at the time who were incredibly close after I got sober despite all the arguements and it became a bit of a situationship and we then got back together. We were together for 2 and a bit months and it was really very wonderful apart from maybe two problems and he was still healing from my betrayal which I will always carry the guilt. He then broke up with me around 5 weeks ago and I am at my whits end. I have a 6 week thearpy course I paid for which will end in two weeks. I have now gotten it in my head I am deserving of all my guilt and pain which I am for most of it DEFO I am not looking for sympathy dw but I have convinced myself walking around today that the next earth shattering or heart breaking thing I will walk into traffic or try and end my life in a way that makes it looks accidental so no one has the burden. This deep suicidal ideation has happened before but it feels really final this time now I have basically no one to bother with this news espeically since I am a teacher. any comments would be helpful on what to do.,Depression

47341,47326,Depression in relationships. Did you leave? Would you return? HelloMy now ex SO has been diagnosed with depression. We have had a wonderful relationship built upon many common interests and values and family blending. He pursued me and we both wanted a serious committment. He admitted he felt depressed to me 2 months ago when I asked him why we had been struggling to do outside things together. There are a few large situational stressors in his life atm but he had not expressed the severity of some of these to me until now.I feel I see the worst of it but friends get his 'all fine here' mask. Family seem to see more of it too but they also come across quite critical which I feel makes him withdraw more. He seems to not be able to make plans in advance anymore even of a few days meaning I cannot clarify if we will see each other until hourslate at night the day before. I have asked him what we could do to make this easier work with how he thinks etc but he has not suggested anything. When I am visiting him he is often engrossed in his cellphone or just wants to watch TV in bed. The feel of absence hurts but I try to coexist and just be there. I have expressed this can be upsetting and that idm if we do our own things together but I need some of our time to be more about us interacting. This has been up and down with things having seemed better lately. He has become more irritable sometimes snapping at me or just seeming short all day. I can't seem to get anything right. I feel like we are always having a conversation through a different filter. I could be talking about something abstract and he will somehow interpret it as a criticism. eg. the other day I had mentioned a friend bought new clothes for her partner as he was in need of some replacements and SO took this as a sly comment at him to update his own wardrobe. I try to do nice things for him leaving notes bringing comfort items making food offering to talk if he needs to. He never wants to talk and the nice things seem to leave little impact after an hour. The task of organising our time together is mostly mine I have asked he share more of this how he can such as both of us deciding on food options sometimes or suggesting something to do just home stuff like movies but this seems to have caused more strain despite him saying he was happy to do it. He has admitted he struggles to discuss his own feelings but also told me he will always be honest which is now untrue as he seems unable to do so. When I try to talk about my feelings on a matter related or unrelated he tends to get frozen up and doesnt say much. If it involves him in any way he has been snapping more and recently and told me he does not have to talk about things just because I want to. I was hurt.Things took a turn recently and he ended it. I was confused as things had been on the up that week. He had started meds a few weeks prior and had a promotion. He said he doesn't know if we fit together but cannot explain why then that it was actually him because he cannot sustain a relationship right now then that he doesn't know who he is and just wants to be alone to figure himself out and cannot see ahead of himself or focus. But said he loves me and thinks I deserve better.I don't know what to think. Is this typical of anyone else's experience with depression and their SO? If so what did you feel when it was you? Did you come back to your partner if your symptoms improved or you recieved working treatment? I have been depressed before but recovered with treatment however I can see all our experiences will differ and how people react to a partner will not always be the same. It manifested differently for me so I am seeking insight and advice on how to proceed.,Depression

47389,47374,Need some advice For the last two years Ive been in a state of frustration in which I cant seem to get out of. I feel like a live in a backwards culture that doesnt care or give two shits about intimacy and relationships. Before COVID I had a shot opportunity to get in a arranged marriage because certain conditions were available. Please Do not bring up dating because its not a thing where Im from. But after COVID every thing that I planned for got screwed over and now parents refuse to arrange a marriage until I graduate. To be in a relationship early on in my life was never negotiable thing for me. I have lost interest in literally everything I used to find enjoyable. Tv shows Gaming Connecting with friends you name it. I also stopped having conversations with my parents. The only thing as of recently Ive been doing Is take a shit load of coursescredit hours and spend 90 of my time just focusing planing and revising how I could be done with this with least time possible. Im CE Major and Ive been powering through it all. But Ive been also worried how being In this state for too long would affect me in the future.

47401,47386,I feel like i was abandoned by all my freinds I feel like i was abandoned by all my friends,Depression
47403,47388,I was doing good and now Im not. This is a good week I had a good day. And all it takes is one person to fuck it all up dude.I hate her I hate her so much but I hate myself more I wish she aborted me. I wish I actually jumped out my window when I was 16. I wish I had a lighter so I could burn myself. It hurts because I was OKAY I did everything right Im getting myself together and its so hard because everyday I have to come home to her.I dont have anyone to talk to I dont want to scare away anyone I dont want to be a problem in anyone else needs to deal with. Im so tired.,Depression
47415,47400,Pointless living and nothing will get better I'm 32M and have been dealing nonfixable problems for a long time. I've seen that extended family is pretty much an arseholes and there's a tipping point where my life changed because of that. At the end of Uni i realised one thing i feel like i picked a wrong subject. That's the time that i realised that working in IT back in my birth country i won't achieve anything or can afford anything by myself. At the same time i realised and considered my existence in this life. I feel nobody could hear my voice nobody cares and so on. Graduated i ended up couldn't find a job for years. Literally years. I had only two jobs one for 6 months and another for 1 month. I never and even up until today feel proud that i worked there. I feel like it's just necessity to do something for moneyliving. That's from i graduated in 20122013 to 2018. Years of sending CVs and interviews none of them stick around. During that 56 years another major event happened to me and my parents. I realised that working in family is a BIG RED WARNING because how they can treat you bad since you're Family. That's what happened to my dad. He lost his job because he and my mom tried to give a reasonable opinion towards my Uncle's son their nephew. Huge debate and my parents ended up losing the job. That moment is a tipping point for me. I had huge anxiety issue and major depression. I went deep down the rabbit hole and i have no point of living anymore Until i got an opportunity to move country by myself for study and got a job in IT industry. For a slight moment i feel better in my life but it went and still goes back to my depressionampx200BFrom here this is the present problem that i have Due to losing a job from his brother and being an older people in my country my dad doesn't have any income at all. I have to support them just for the sake being a son should help their parents' or anything about Family should support each other Due to my depression i got a suggestion from counsellor that helping people might help me slowly. Oh boy it's a very very wrong advice. I ended up losing lots and lots of money helping someone just to get on their feet and still didn't help. I can't even afford to rent place. House pricing is ridiculous that includes living cost crisis that happened anywhere around the world. Having flatmates is a nightmare. I even tried to sacrifice what i do regularly so they can have things they want like quieter place have their freedom etc.But all of them back to the reason why i created this postI'm tired living like this. This issue never ends and the only solution is pretty much having enough or lots of money. People just don't care what i've been through and nobody wants to help me as well. Family friends all of them are just arseholes.Sometimes i wish they're gone. Like literally gone or die. My parents and everybody else in this world. If it doesn't allow i just wish i'm dead. Never wake up anymore in the morning. I already wish the same thing every night. I feel done and i'm actually done both physically and mentally. Stress feeling sick all the time i sleep through the weekend and still feeling tired i have no friends and nobody Losing money means i have money problem as well and nothing's good anymore in my life.I have made peace with death. Living is a thing that scared me the most.,Depression
47416,47401,I dont know what to do I just want to stop hurting Everyone always leaves in my life wether its friends or girlfriends and I understand why. I try to be the most kind person I can be and everyone treats me like shit. I then try to stand up for myself and now have nobody. And now everyday Im in constant conflict with myself trying to figure out if Im just pushing them away. But i can even ask anyone because I have no friends. I dont know if its because Im ugly because a lot of girls i meet we have a sexual or romantic encounters but they always make things just friends. I started to think maybe I deserve being alone for like a past life or something idk. Im just looking for friends i guess and this is a desperate attempt sorry for taking up your time if this is too much. Have a good one,Depression
47419,47404,I really want to cry But I just cant physically do it at the moment. I have so many things going on and I am so overwhelmed. I just want to cry myself to sleep but instead of tears I get snot in my nose. Its like all my tears accumulated in my nose. Its so annoying. I just want a good cry.,Depression

47432,47417,I cant go on like this I've had depression and anxiety for 10 years now im 23 and I'm starting to lose all hope. Ive never felt so hopeless I literally have no faith left and its scary. I dont feel like I'm ever going to get better and can't see a future for myself. Im at the point where I've just accepted that this is how its gonna be and I'm not strong enough to get myself out of this. Its draining. Ive tried so hard over the years to get better but it hasnt worked and I feel like I just keep getting worse. I give up. My brain is confused and my body is in pain. I cant go on like this.,Depression
47435,47420,i wish death would come depressed lonely and everything feels pointless. wish i could go to sleep and not wake up,Depression
47446,47431,i'm tired and i want to die Can someone give me a reason not to die? If you say something sensible I will not commit suicide.,Depression
47451,47436,I guess Im an acceptance. Seems to be a theme hear about taking hints. A lot of these posts come in waves.Basically dont choose someone who didnt choose you. If theyre fine without you in their life then never take them back when they come back. People who are OK with you not being in their lives are not worth your mental wellbeing. In the past when I had read these I never really understood them. I do now. As hard as it is for me to accept because to accept it means its real. They never cared. They left. Theyre gone. Forever. They never coming back. They never wanted to. Im their now. Its been a long road. A painful journey. One that Ill never repeat again in my life.ever!!! it isnt over yet. And by that I mean the outcome of me. I know I will not be that same I was before I met my ex person. I dont know if Ill have that positive and exciting outlook on life anymore. I dont even know if Ill have the motivating desire to want a better in life that I had when met my ex. Large part of me went silent. You could even see a large part of my died. The part of me that started to actually want to live and enjoy life..I didnt have that part of me growing up even into my early adulthood. I listened eagerly to her stories. I told her mine. I did whatever I could to make her dailies a little easier. To give her a reason to smile. If it was sending her dinners a random bouquet of flowers with some chocolate and a teddy or just telling her a joke..mostly bad onesI tried my best to show my person I loved her. To me she was the world my tomorrows my happy my love my life MY ONEBut to her I was no one special. In her own words there was nothing special about me.She took the best parts. She got better. She had options. She chose. She didnt choose me. I was the one she chose one she had no one else to choose from. That was what I was to her. That was my value to her. I have finally excepted this. I cant lie to myself anymore. She chooses not to be in my life and she chooses to ghost. I dont know what tomorrow will hold. But I know I dont want to see it. The pain within me only increases. They say with time things get better. For me it seems to be the opposite. Ive always been different. Maybe that is my curse. Im not like the crowd. Doesnt seem to be a good thing for me more like a curse.I shouldve remain secluded. I shouldve remained to myself. I shouldve known that no one would understand. I shouldve known no one would care.,Depression
47466,47451,Dentist appt So I havent been to the dentist from 2016 I dont need any ew comments I already know. The reason why I havent returned in 7 years is because my dentist SA me and was put in jail. To say Im scared is an understatement. Now I have Dx depression anxiety CPTSD etc etc so I know I have what we call depression mouth. I am uninsured and honestly im scared to be judged and feel guilty and unsafe for my appt. I requested a female dr and I will slightly explain my situation prior to my appt so I do not feel unsafe. Im terrified my teeth will need a lot of work. No theyre not rotting or broken or gross at all actually. I have never even had a cavity but now with all this time passed I am afraid. Anyone else experience dentist anxiety. Any advice or kind words will be appreciated. Thank you.,Depression
47491,47476,Tired.. Haven't renewed my prescription for testosterone because I'm not sure I want to be alive anymore. I'm so tired of checking the news and seeing how fucked the world is. So many bills are being passed out of hatred for the Trans and Gay community. Women are being treated like cattle.. and overwhelming hatred of the Indigenous Black and BIPOC people. It hurts. I don't know if I want to do this anymore. I'm so tired.,Depression
47507,47491,Getting treated like shit for being a trans girl It's been 1 and a half year and I'm still getting ignored by my so called family wtf am i supposed to do here. Getting treated like this in the whole town is one thing but i want at least one person here to treat me like every other cis girl I'm freakin tired of this and I lose all the motivation to do anything. I'm born in a country where being trans is like being a demon or some shit what do i do,Depression
47512,47496,What am I waiting for? I am making no significant strides to become better or get my shit together. I think the possibility of suicide has been looming over me for so long that Im using it as an excuse to not get my shit together if that makes sense. Like oh I dont need to figure out a career path cause Im probably going to kms. My life is going no where. And I dont care enough to do anything about it. I have absolutely nobody. Im just a disappointment to myself and my family. Idk what Im waiting for.,Depression
47532,47516,Im so done. i cant function anymore. i dont get out of bed i can hardly get anything done it is too much.. day after day after day i sleep in dont show up to where im supposed to be. i have no interest in things i used to enjoy and all they do is make me anxious.. everything feels like a burden. i have no answer to why i dont show why i dont do nything on time.. i dont have any answers and i know none of this is gonna end well.. im gonna be in such deep trouble with my college.. my attendance they could hold my exams even for this. i dont know what to do anymore. i used to like to do stuff. i used to enjoy but i dont anymore. IM so anxious that im not where im supposed to be and at the same time i just dont care.. my mind feels numb. everything is a blur. days are just passing by me.. and im just stuck.. im losing track of time.. im losing touch with friends and family. im slipping away.,Depression
47535,47519,I dont know who I am anymore Ive always been known for my kindness and empathy and in my opinion that was the only thing good about me but lately Ive been rude sometimes and making jokes who hurt other people without thinking about it. My intention never was hurting them but I say what comes to my mind without thinking how it would affect others. As a sensitive person I feel like a piece of shit because I would not like if the things I say were redirected to me thats I know they are rude. Im afraid Im turning into a horrible person because Im losing my common sense and its making me conscious because the moment I realize I did that I feel the worst person on earth. I want to be a kind person again,Depression
47550,47534,I'm tired of living for happiness of a family that doesn't give a shit about mine It's getting harder and harder everyday to stay alive and suffer for a family that caused my depression.,Depression
47555,47539,Had enough now and am considering offing myself. Its not sadness or anger Im filled with anymore its just nothingness. I cant remember the last time I really smiled or had a good laugh Ill watch co workers laughing at a joke and when theyre eyes meet mine I have to apply the classic fake smile to avoid those awkward questions. I used to break down a lot like a lot had my work notice the aftermath of a lunchtime sob in my car and was pulled into the office and asked the usual are you ok nonsense. Having sleeping issues because I just dont want tomorrow to actually come. Dont want to deal with another day of perpetual bullshit. Leaving seems like the idea solution just now. Im done with the rat race and the constant battle to survive tired of piloting this meat cage around.,Depression
47560,47544,I feel like I never stood a chance I was made fun of over my appearance ever since I was young. I was just a child and had poor self esteem and confidence even though I didnt know about those concepts yet. I was afraid to interact with others and felt like everywhere I went people were laughing at me. This lasted all the way until I graduated high school. Years of maturing and some plastic surgery later I dont feel as self conscious but the damage has been done. I hate myself. I feel grotesque and worthless. I want to die so that I stop feeling this way. I constantly wonder why the universe would allow me to come into this world and live like this. Am I being punished for something I did in my past life? I have tried therapy but the relief was only brief. I would take a picture or catch my reflection at a different angle and be reminded just how ugly I am. I want to accept it but its so hard. I find myself mourning my younger self and it makes me even more depressed to know that there was no hope for me from the start.,Depression
47568,47552,The life I've worked for is gone. When I was 18 I had moved out because I has a strained relationship with my family. I moved away because I wanted to put distance so that the relationship could be repaired. I ended up moving across state lines and then eventually moved down south halfway across the country at my father's suggestion for an easier life while I worked and got my degree. And the distance did exactly what I wanted it showed my parents that I was strong and capable and mature and that I was an adult. But it also created a great longing for home. Life was easier. I got a better job I bought a house and I live comfortably with my husband. But... We don't like it here. We like the small city the restaurants the proximity the healthcare etc. But the environment and climate do not align with us. We are northerners at heart. We like the seasons fall and winter the hills the mountains the streams winding through the forest. We miss it so dearly it hurts sometimes. But I also miss my family. I miss my parents my brother my nephew. I miss my childhood best friend and her family. I am heartbroken seeing years pass and I am missing from their daily life and they are missing from mine. I am just incredibly lonely here and I want to be with them. There has always been an obstacle preventing us from moving back but the biggest one being how expensive it is there and we would have struggled unless we were finished school and in our wellplaying fields. So years pass by and we stay here while wishing we there. Well now my parents are getting older approaching their 60s. They want to retire but they don't want to retire there they want to retire in the state I'm currently in. So then becomes a new dilemma do I stay in this state that doesn't make me happy so I can be with my parents and potentially my brother in time? Do I move back home and enjoy my brother's company for as long as I have it I have my friends my climate and my job? Either way I'm giving up something that feels nonnegotiable for my complete happiness. I'm overcome with this intense sadness that I've spent all the years where I could have had it all being away. And now they are gone and I feel as if the life I have worked so hard in my degree and in life to get back to is gone. Ive tried talking to my family about staying in their current state or maybe moving to another state that I know they love and enjoy and that we do as well and they don't budge this is their plan. I feel selfish when I push too hard. I don't know what to do. I'm overwhelmed with sadness. I just accepted a job in my career because I just graduated but its even further south and even though its an amazing career opportunity I feel like its a step backward in the life I wanted.,Depression
47581,47565,Want to die but just cant seem to do it I have 0 intention of living. Ive never been able to view life the way others view it and therefore never really enjoyed much in life to begin with. After cracking my brain for countless of nights i still cant come up with whats stopping me for doing it. This may come off as me being ungratefulselfish for my familyfriends but i cant live this life any longer just for them. It has already gotten to a point where theyre starting to blame themselves for how ive turned out and its just not fair to them. Yet despite knowing all of this and wanting to die with all my heart i still dont have what it take to do it. I cant even wrap my head around how pathetically weak my mind isCant i just do something right for once,Depression
47595,47579,I want to have one last week of fun before I kill myself My current life is nothing but constant lonely monotony and working all the time and I fear thats how the rest of my life will be. Ive fantasized about gathering up all of my savings booking a trip to Vegas staying in a nice airbnb and having as much fun in sin city as I can for a week before I end it all. I need at least one last good adventure that I can look back on and be proud of. Id rather spend the last week of my life living it to the fullest than spend the rest of my life in depressing monotony,Depression
47605,47589,I've lost myself to depression conflicted self inflicted misery has made me numb. I thrive off academic validation. Having become stagnant in every way possible and unreachable has made me cold hearted. The only way to numb the non reluctant pain is through expressive amount of work. At all times. I've had depression for ten years and have the diagnoses of chronic depression. Being a remarkable student doesn't fix the pain. It numbs it. If I don't indulge in work then my depression hits. Filling my brain with work excludes me from killing myself. The amount of work does at least give me an accommodating future. Being caught up in this misery of perfectionism is ruining me. What I fear most is summer vacation. I can't stand vacation. The time where I drive myself nuts on my own. Signing up for lecture after lecture. I really am in misery but I am too numb to cry. I am waiting for vacations so that I can work myself to an extent just over manageable. An extent that makes people worried if they knew. Even though people only see a little glimpse of my sickness I am very very sick. I am aware but also so sick that I'll always keep going.,Depression
47619,47603,What do you do when? What are you meant to do when you hit 40 and realise you've achieved nothing and never will that you're not special or creative or talented that the world will not change in the slightest because of you that fiction is depressing as these characters you love would scorn you for being useless and average and pointless? I feel like as a kid I used to dream I could do something make something but here I am unable to make anything of worth doped up on Prozac and working a basic admin job which I could do in my sleep. But I don't know how to be anything more. I don't have a mentor I don't have support or guidance I don't think I ever did. I'm so unfulfilled. I doubt I'm alone. I suspect many people are like this. Which makes it worse really. Escapism hurts because all I can imagine is my beloved characters loathing me but i can't make anything in the real world as I don't know how and I don't have any real talent and absolutely no drive or passion. Sometimes the only thing I think I contributed is that being nearly menopausal at least I have never and will never breed so no others will feel like this. I don't want the point of my life to be a negative. I wanted childfreeness to give me the freedom to be worthwhile in my own right but I just am not. I wanted to be a creator not a mere consumer. All my friends are successful some famous some highly qualified some just with good jobs and fulfilment and I am without doubt the group 'loser'. I'm so tired. I'm so jealous all the time. I want to make something to give to people that they want and like but I have no audience nobody who cares or wants anything of me.I can't even hold to any faith. I can't believe. I hate being atheistic I hate the lack of meaningful beauty to me I'm fully aware of the 'but nature is beautiful!' type arguments but without any animistic sentience I guess it doesn't matter to me but I can't do it. I hate the doctrine of 'make your own meaning' it's illogical if one's self has no meaning then one's madeup meaning in turn has no meaning. I used to love loving the gods but I can't feel them any more. I miss my faith so so much. And I can't make anything of myself in the 'real' world. The emptiness is so much.,Depression
47629,47613,I wasn't ready Just a personal win I decided to share. Dear Journal I got sick again. The same cyclical vomiting and upper stomach pain I had before. Yesterday and last night was the lworst of it. I'm just now starting to feel slightly better. My biggest regret is how quickly I wanted to end my life. This wasnt a little pain by any means. The last time this happened I had a psychotic break in the hospital and tried to cut myself open. This time wasn't as severe or long but still the pain got so bad I wanted to end it all. I even thought of how. But by some stroke of fate I talked myself out of it. Citing mostly that I just wasn't ready. I spent the rest of the night repeating that it will pass. All storms pass this will too. I know it sounds sillybut either by distracting myself or blind luck I started to feel better.I've always believed you gotta do what you gotta do. Last night I had to survive and I did. I dont know how or even why I managed to talk myself out of it but I am grateful. I can't say I'll always have that power. It didn't even sound like words I would say. I mean this will pass how clich. But as the night passed and dawn broke I knew I made it. Just a reminder for anyone that needs it you're not fighting alone. We can get thru this together ,Depression
47630,47614,Depression has crept back up to me I wouldnt say it ever left me but the depression has gotten severe these past few days.Why me? Why cant I just feel happiness and live a somewhat normal life?Im a 25M who hasnt had a girlfriend since my early 20s. I just dont see myself getting better. The depression has consumed me and I feel terrible for my friends and family. Like maybe I am a root of the bad energy in the friend group.I still live with my mom I have money saved but I have no clue what to do. My appetite gone again all the weight and progress Ive gained from the gym has been lost. And I just have no energy or motivation at the moment. I work part time and even at work some days I just feel so unfulfilled with my job. I just feel like a freaking loser. And im letting those around me down. I am hoping it will either get better or I just die because Im tired of feeling like this.,Depression
47637,47621,I don't feel anything anymore I haven't felt anything in so long I don't remember what it feels like to be happy I don't even think I care anymore I don't feel like myself. I feel like a robot going through day by day I don't even have control of myself sometimes I just randomly regain my composure and I'm doing something I don't even remember doing. I don't even feel worried I just feel numb I don't want help I just wanted to kind of vent,Depression
47640,47624,I'm different now and it hurts Decided to use one of my many alt accounts and put it to work. My depression used to comes in waves and typically I could handle and channel it into art or music or something but recently this one I haven't been able to shake it and it's killed my productivity. I don't know really what set it off I never do. But in it I've realized alot about myself amongst other things which makes me feel worse. Ill go through some but this ones a biggie. For context I was dating a girl for a while when it started i was like 15 and she was 18 going on 19 and she was allways emotionally abusive in some form but it all went down hill my junior year when I was 17 she started drinking more often and mixing her meds with it. Long story short she ghosted for like 3 or 4 months and when she did contact me it was pretty much to say she's dumping me and moving to Florida with a friend she met in college who I have on good report she was cheating on me with. I still haven't emotionally recovered from that mess every negative thing that happened to me has left me afraid of a repeat in my next relationship. Since then my life got worse year after year and it's only just starting to stabilize again. One of those years though has left me blaming myself for getting my grandmother sick during covid leading to her death in 2021. There where other horrible events that lead me to here and now. On new year I decided to try to recapture how I use when I was 15. I was relatively happy I had confidence and drive to try to reach my dreams and personal goals and I had friends and people that loved me. But I cant all those aspects of me just don't last each time I mange to reclaim somepart of my former self something happens to destroy it and leave me worse off. In my attempt to reclaim something I've realized how far I've fallen behind people I considered friends and looked up to. They have great jobs they're chasing their dreams forming families surviving on their own going to college and are making something of themselves and I'm still in our home town working at the local Casey's living in a spare room my stepfather and bio mother had no plans for. I'm not even sure they wanted me here they say they do but I know they didn't want a 20 year old moving inafter being kicked out. It's like no remnants of my former self exists if younger me could see me and realize how much I've changed for the worse he would beat me for wasting time and destroying what little attractiveness we had. I've always realized change was one of those things that are inevitable like death. I've always realized me from 6 years would be different from me now but I just always hoped it'd be for the better and not the worse possible thing to happen to me. The few people I've vented have always told me something about gods testing or he has a plan for me but fuck he must really despise me to make my grandfather who I lived with from 1 to 20 an abusive drunk who loved yelling screaming and threatening me every chance he got till he kicked me out the day after Christmas put me in an abusive relationship let me get bullied horribly by almost everyone and take away one of the the few people I knew care for me and make her death be on my head. Change is a constant and I've been changed so much that in just I few years that I'm permanently altered and the realization that I can't go back has hurt me far worse then any person can. Sorry to subject you to my ramblings I remembered doing this used to help me and I was hoping it would again but it hasn't. Sorry for the botherMr.E,Depression

But I can't stop being a dick and messing up it's something I have no control over I'm drowning into these voices and things people tell me I am or I'm not.

47735,47719,I am tired of being lonely I am so tired of being lonely to the point of removing myself. I have had it right up to me head several times but im always too afraid to pull the trigger and vegetable myself. Im a 24yo kissless virgin incel and have no friends or family. I am so inept at making friends or talking to girls. I havent even tried talking to girls in 8 something years because i convinced myself that i dont like them but God i want someone to love and connect and grow with eventually start a family. Theres a cute girl i work with that i tried talking to for a bit but i know im too ugly and dont offer anything so i just blocked her. She asked about it the next day and made me add her back on social media stuff and i ended up blocking her again. Im simply not good enough she deserves better. I missed out on meeting someone in highshool or college and so im destined to be a 40yo virgin. I hate seeing all these couples around me some my age being happy and being normal. Why cant i just be normal. Why am i an outcast. If only i could muster the courage to pull that trigger id save myself so much pain.,Depression

47757,47741,I've been struggling but I think this is the last straw.. My mom died last Oct I've been fighting legal battles with my stepbrothers that dropped surprise court papers on me that basically said fuck you in mid Dec. They were supposed to be filing an estate immediately but took their time until they conspired enough support and stolen everything they wanted. Last month the legal battles were supposed to be over they withdrew they are not over...Just under a month ago I began the laborious task of moving 20yrs of stuff with little to no help. The things the stepbrothers stole like truck and trailer would of helped tremendously in moving and storage.This last weekend I began swapping some of my mom's stuff out for mine and disposing of some of it. I moved half of it to the curb and kept back a working fridge and a couch.Then I got sick I'm still sick.Garbage came Tuesday and still sick I halfheartedly worked on my mess...as the local neighbor rookie gunhobcop drop by...he seen me working... I seen him see me.Today I received a citation for non working appliances it's a nuisance...except they do work...well the fridge did. I removed the doors as the officer I called and spoke to advised. Then I proceeded to fill my sidewalk with ever single bit of stuff I don't want.This same cop started dating a girl down the street last year at some point who recently turned 18...Around this time my step dad died and mom had cancer I was having financial troubles and gas was 5Gallon. I asked on local Facebook pages trying to get a charger for my electric trimmer to no avail. Eventually my grass was exactly the height max allowed..in spots...so naturally this same cop took it upon themselves to send me a citation. When complaining about the citation on a local page I was told if I can't afford to mow my grass I should pay someone to do it.........like wtf...I just want to mourn my mother's death but even after months of struggling nonstop I can't take 2 days off to be sick. Fuck farmington il fuck fpd fuck Officer M. Carlock.,Depression

47789,47772,I inadvertently starve myself I am exhausted. The thought of getting out of bed most days feels extremely difficult. The thought of making myself food and eating feel impossible. I used to not be able to go to sleep hungry but more recently i do it every day. If i am tired i am going straight to bed even if i am starving. Sometimes when i take vitamins my brain thinks that is enough to keep off my hunger while i sleep. A few months ago i completely lost my appetite and didn't eat for over a day. It went away and my appetite came back but recently I've been eating only one or two meals a day. Not because i want to lose weight. I just am so tired. If it's not fast food i can barely eat it. I can't eat a lot anymore. Sometimes the smell of food is sickening even if I'm hungry. Most of my meals are fast food. I am constantly hungry but it doesn't bother me as much anymore. Has anyone else felt like this?,Depression

47838,47821,Getting up to get better I've been falling into a massive pit of dispair. I can't take meds for it because it counteracts other diagnosis. I have a therapy appointment on Monday I'm skeptical about going to for judgement. Im terrified of leaving the house and speaking to people just someone looking at me is enough to trigger a panic attack I've even been avoiding my housemates as much as possible. I talk to people online but I feel like I'm going crazy. Ive tried to stop myself from suicide 3 times in the last two weeks. Theirs no other help other than this free place I reluctantly arranged to go to. I'm overwhelmed with anxiety and paranoia. When people speak to me or look at me or breathe near me I wanna disappear as fast as possible. I'm thinking of wearing a mask and sunglasses to walk to the appointment on Monday so no one can recognize me or try to talk to me. Because people seeing me is my biggest issue. I don't understand why. But it's seriously affecting me I haven't left the house in many days. Barely been able to shower brush my teeth cook and working is just as hard but the only thing I've managed. Now the level of my paranoia is affecting my work. I wish I could just snap out of it. I want to clean up and exercise and stuff but I can't get out of bed.,Depression

47924,47906,Is it possible for me to be happy? I 22 have been living with suicide thoughts since I was 15 yo and and I've been tried to kill myself at least 5 times. I really can't remember when I was ok but at the same time it's been at least 2 years since I tried to kill myself so I think there's an improvement. But now I just feel tired of trying tired of existing my hair is a mess my bedroom is in a terrible condition and I have to force myself to eat. I can't find something that excites me it's just like if I was alone all the time but at the same time surrounded by people that can't comprehend this feeling.Is it cause I don't have friends? My social anxiety got worse over time. As I met new people they just treated me like a clown it was as if I were their entertainment.Even sending a message online makes my heart run like crazy. Once someone harassed me when entering a chat for kpop stans it was a traumatic experience so I decided to go as incognito as I could.And then I can't get treatment for this.Why don't I go to a psychologist? You may ask well... There's a member of my family that is a psychologist and she's really a manipulative and an hypocrite b so my parents don't let me see one. I know they are worried but I need help.,Depression
47936,47918,I dont know what to name this I dont know how many times Ive fantasized a relationship knowing it will never happen. Yet each time I do it it makes me angry that I believe such a thing could happen. I hate that Im aware that Im making a fool out of myself yet again I still choose to believe. I cant ever stop thinking about this. It is the only topic ever on my mind. I hate seeing happy couples I hate seeing people happy in general. I hate seeing people have fun while I spiral down into my own mental ruin. Whenever I get a opportunity to talk about my problems I never do it. Matter of fact I dont take opportunities to anything. I have only a couple real friends besides the people who are just horrible to me. No matter what I do Ill always be judged. Im tired of being treated like an outcast for no reason. What the fuck did I do for you to hate me? There is no actual reason people are just fucking toxic. Im tired of sitting here pretending that everythings okay. Im tired of hoping that things could change. I dont need therapy I dont need any medication I dont need hope I dont need motivation I need to dieWhat am I saying tomorrow will be betterright?,Depression
47948,47930,Recently realised Im depressed and I dont know how to help myself. HelloIm just looking for any ideas of how to help myself really. I realised a few weeks ago that Im depressed. Mainly because Im a general failure at life really but Ive also had a couple of traumatic incidents in the past. I sleep all the time I eat fast food and chocolate and I just never seem to FEEL anything except annoyance. Im on sertraline have been for years for anxiety but I still feel this way. The NHS website says to exercise but I dont want to do that and Im also hypermobile which makes it difficult to exercise. I want to get better but I dont really know how If anyone has got any advice on how to help myself I would really appreciate it.P.S I do not currently have any thoughts that I would be better off dead. I am not thinking of or planning on doing that.,Depression
47952,47934,not sure about what to do with my life. For the past 4 years I've 18m struggled with depression I guess it started with the very turbulent divorce of my parents a violent fuckfest when I was 14yo in 2019 it was at that time that I started doing drugs such as mdma lsd and cocaine however I'd say my drug consumption really started as young as 12 given that I would abuse my adhd medication ritalin by snorting it.Later down that year I had some pretty shitty moments with my mother physical violence as my father abandoned us to go live in another country for half the year when he came back they found out about my drug usage which again ended up in physical abuse and the over infantilization of a 15 yo boy who never had any freedom or power in his life my parents started walking me to school it was 2 blocks away from home lmao once they even punched me infront of my classmates and threatened some random boy about beating him up because they confused him with someone I smoked weed with.At the end of that year they sent me to love with my grandma in another country.There I was all alone in a country that was foreign to me although I was born there I had family of course but I can't really be myself around my family the year was 2020 and I was just starting classes again when the pandemic hit it was at that point when I abandoned my studies for the first time tbh I didn't suffer through covid because I lived with my cousin and we played videogames all day but I ended up drinking a ton of alcohol in secret again sniffing gas from the stove stealing pills from my grandma because I was desperate life felt like it physically weighted on meI stopped eating because sadness did not allow me to I started getting weaker and weaker untill 10onths later my mother picked me up and we returned to tje country I was raised in.It did not get better for a long time.My mother did not trust me at all and didn't allow me to go outside I was 16 at the time she even hid the keys from me.As I realized that she would never trust me again I said fuck it and started smoking weed again yadda yadda I start studying again and pass the year yay but still I was a 17yo boy who isolated himself for 2 years and didn't talk irl to anyone that wasn't family I developed a serious internet addiction due to it.In 2022 stuff got slightly better but not really during summer break I met a girl 26yo online and we start talking we like each other the first time I left my house in years for something that wasn't school was to meet her which I did at the cemetery I was 17.Later in that year I get into an altercation with my mother and she beats me again and kicked me out of her house after that I live with my father for a couple weeks before she decided to ask me to come back home again she never said sorry I get even more depressive to the point I abandon my studies again.Then I become 18 years old and this 26yo girl I talked about before asks to unvirgin me to which I said yes she invited me to her brother's bday party.When everyone went to sleep we were in bed together I was sleepy and high and she was drunk and coked tf up we had a very awkward kiss I then say that I forgot to bring condoms and she mounts me anyway before I could say anything.After that shitty experience we become a couple my first girlfriend ever yay.Fuck it was a rollercoaster of shit she was abusive she offered me coke after I was clean for 3 years she insulted me and said I was only useful for sex she even slapped me a couple of times.Why does everyone abuses me?Now 2023 I have my first job but I still struggle with my weight which makes me very self aware of how weak and small I am.. I feel ugly I feel emasculated.Now I have to study again and I just can't keep up with study and work my work shift goes from 4am to 12pm and my classes go from 6pm to 12amI just want to give up I feel like I don't deserve anything I just want to sleep and sleep and wake up when everything's allright.Sorry I don't know why I wrote this sorry for the english.,Depression
47966,47948,Im so tired I just dont see a point to my suffering I dont understand it I want to know what Ive done so wrong to deserve everything Id say sorry and do anything to make it stop! I already have a burial plot in my home town due to my family buying some after my father over dosed on a cocktail of pain meds I know Im not perfect Im sorry if I could be better mentally and get plastic surgery to look better if I knew if I could just change I would Im tired Im so tired I have nothing to keep me here I honestly believe even my boyfriend is probably just waiting for me to realize that he doesnt actually like me Im just tired Im living any more my closest friend knows what to do when I die,Depression
47967,47949,Don't know what to do anymore Back when I was in high school I was struggling to make friends and didn't have the greatest of home lifes either my parents argued all the time and at times when they had no form of release for their anger and frustration I would end up their verbal punching bag or in extremely rare cases physical action would be taken as well. Back then I was on a constant mental decline due to loneliness and solitude I constantly found my self in. In order to try and combat it I did theater programs run through my school. The high school I was at is know for their theatre programs as well as their music department. Though run by about 34 teachers the school was known for how much it did within the field. the shows had thousands of dollars spent on them each year the music students took trips to music competitions with everyother year taking them to a competition in NYC. I loved theatre even did quite well in it up until I was about 21 but it wasnt the environment of the school that got me into it. It was the fact that all the students seemed to friends with each other. Casts of the school shows seemed like familys at times and with my home life the way it was I wanted something like that. So I joined the select choir that led to me being subtly hinted at to audition for the schools shows well as subtle as people in that field could be. I did so hoping to join the family they created and got into the shows and was a part of the cast every year. now long story short I was never accepted fully into their family it was those teenage years where they had already determined friend groups but it allowed me time away from home for as many hours as possible. So some days with rehearsals or performances I would be at the school starting at 7 am until 11 pm. So I dedicated myself to the shows they were the one thing that really kept me going. Cut my senior year I was known for being a bad student amongst my peers. I never did homework because I would be too depressed at home to do it so many teachers would yell at me in front of other students in attempts to get me to improve my habits. None of it worked though mostly due to the fact that test scores could easily out weigh a students homework score to create a passing grade and with me never really getting below a 90 percent on any test it led me to focus on theatre instead. I loved it at this point the fall semester I was planning to audition for colleges and try to make a career out of this. Not only that but my school vocal director who doubled as the musical director chose a show we were gonna be dumping money into. I mean I think the show spent around 200k fabrics imported for India a large bell was made so it could be rung on stage without making a sound costumes rented from the former professional touring production it was a lot. I was excited for the year my fellow seniors were all really talented and it felt like for once I had a piece of the future to look forward to even if it was only 6 months worth of future. It didn't last long though. before the call back list was posted one day many of us were hanging out in the vocal directors classroom one girl was sitting behind the desk of the director since it was the most comfortable chair there when she started going though some of the directors things. When pressed about it she said she was looking to see if her boyfriend at the time had made it into the show if he didn't then she'd have to do her senior show without him. Another guy started to help her out of what I could only assume to be a mixture of bordem and curiosity when they stumbled apon a mock call back list as well as peoples rating for their auditions. the guy realized that they shouldn't be doing this and backed away to talk to others while the girl looked around asking others to look at it all for her. I wanted friends so I did. I told her that her boyfriend had a good audition and when other students pressed me about out it we talked about the call back list. The director eventually found out that people were going through her desk and when she asked other students about it they all said I had done it in search of the call back list. None of them said that anything about the other two students they didn't tell her how I just read out what they had found they placed everything on me. I don't know why they all did this I dont think I ever will but it led to the director to looking to see if I had done anything else. Apparently at this point other students had claimed that I said that a girl wasn't in the call back list and it saddened her to the point of tears first off that was wrong because I distinctly remember saying that she had a damn good chance to get the leading role along with everyone else on that list for it. She was and still is extremely talented and I've never claimed anything else. Next these students said I read the transcript of a math class for another student and bullied them for it. Now with this I did read this transcript the student had left it out on a table in the vocal classroom for about 23 weeks and one day I picked up and read it made a comment about to to other students in the room and put it back on the table it was. Unknown to me at the time that student had dropped out hence why he never came to retrieve the paper and why itd been there so long. I know the entirety of that situation because I had reached out to him to apologize when people started to blame me for him dropping out. He told me it was fine and didn't know what was happening because he made and followed through on that decision far before any of this happened. Unfortunately for me though the director only heard that the student dropped out and that I according to others had bullied him. She pulled me aside one day to tell me how disappointed she was in me she told me how she knew everything I'd done and that there's no reason to attempt to lie about anything. She said I was the reason that kid dropped out and that I robbed her of the chance to save him she said I violated her trust by going through what must have been all of her things to find the audition information and she said that she couldn't believe I would lie to people and tell others that a girl wasn't up for a role where she really was. I didn't know what to do the director what certain in what she knew and I knew she wasn't changing her mind on any of it so I just through tears said I was sorry that I didn't mean to hurt anyone. The director was like a mother to me and now she was pinning all these things to me and I didn't know what to do. So as punishment she wanted me to apologize to the girl I was to never be in her classroom without her being there and that she couldn't in good faith help me with any college auditions. She finished it all off by saying that because of this all she didn't know if she could ever trust me again. It broke me I isolated myself for the rest of the school year she thankfully still let me be in the show that year but I tried to not talk to many people at rehearsals if I wasn't spoken to first. I applied for other degree fields at colleges. And outside of school I rarely spoke to anyone unless it was online gaming. I didn't perform for over year after that I couldn't get myself to be near a stage. I eventually got the courage to audition for the theatre department at the college I attended and got in. But after a year and a half the anxiety of being around a stage and performing and the anxiety that I would just be someone's scape goat or disappointment again led to major problems for me. I developed a severe panic attack and anxiety disorder and my body would start literally breaking down under the stress of it all leading at points to trips to the ER for internal bleeding. I quit performing for good after that I haven't been on a real stage since I was 19 and I haven't performed since I was 21. I'm 23 now and I don't know what to do I had to drop out of college because of my mental health my father has threatened to kick me out of the house because my choice to leave school and when my mother opposed his idea threatened to divorce her and list me as the cause.im stuck in a deadend job working 60 hours a week and I've lost all will to do anything. I don't know what to do I've lost everything and have no one. I just wanted friends and ended up here. I have a therapist but even after sessions I just leave feeling empty. How do I keep going like this,Depression
47971,47953,Whats gonna happen? I 19f are slowly coming to terms with the fact that I might be suffering with depression.Im getting to this conclusion through having noticed the change in myself and through gentle research and sharing thoughts with a very dear and extraordinarily patient friend.Im reluctant to seek professional help but I dont think Im sustainable like this.I just wanted to ask if there was anyone from the UK who could sort of tell me what would happen if I were to go to the GP and seek help.Thank you,Depression
47977,47959,My existence is meaningless I have no dreams no goals and no plans for the future. I'm bad at my job and feel like I'm gonna get fired soon. I have no friends no social life and no Hobby's. My room looks like shit I look like shit and haven't done any form of selfcare since a week.

Ive had high hopes for myself most years before this but it just hit me these last few years that theres a 99 chance nothing positive is ever going to happen and Im not going to be shit.

47992,47974,News some wisdom So you know how whenever someone is depressed or feeling out of hope in life people say stuff like oh dont worry it gets better nothing lasts forever. Well Ive been depressed for a while now and some of the causes of my depression dont seem to have a solution. It even looks like it most likely will get worse with time. How would you advice me with this situation or help me be more optimistic about my life??,Depression
47995,47977,Battling with intrusive thoughts Tw thoughts of self harm drug abuse suicidal thoughts m22 if you careFirst things first I really need to vent right now and dont know if anyone is even gonna read that but I just need to get this out of my head.And sorry if my english isn't good...So I've been battling depression for over a decade I've mostly gotten better after years of therapy and carefully choosing the people around me so I've been pretty stable for a few years with less and less backlashes.Today marks the first day after about 3 years where I'm getting extremely intense thoughts about self harming drug abuse and even suicidal thoughts.I've already been in a pretty bad mood today overthinking a lot and shit like that and I had to go to social event I didn't really wanna take part in but usually it turns out better than expected. It wasn't like that today. I've felt even worse and useless despite my friends trying to cheer me up and realized that I'm not good at anything. I tried to drink those thoughts away with some cocktails which usually works wonders for me in social events but that just made it worse.Since I got home I've just been sitting on my bed and staring at the wall my thoughts going through a downward spiral. I drank some more and feel better and worse at the same time. I've even got to the point that I noticed another issue I haven't even realized before but makes so much sense comparing it to the events in my life. Then I thought of numbing my pain with a method I used years ago forced myself not to because the scars have almost faded out. Then I thought about what drugs I could use to distract my mind even started to research before I stopped myself and decided to rant here.I'm very aware of my thoughts which makes me instantly feel regretful and even more like a shitty person.I just want to cry and try to vent through that but that's something I still can't do. Love society for teaching boys that they aren't allowed to cry.Anyways I hope I can force myself to focus on something else now that I've written this shit down. My mind does feel a bit clearer now without taking some extreme steps.Also to everyone reading this I hope you have a great day tomorrow. And maybe we can all fight our inner demons some day and live a better life. Just trying to survive one day at a time.,Depression

48025,48007,I am filled with envy pride and resentment. I will start of by saying that I may or may not be suffering from depression. Ever since I turned 21 I started feeling jelous towards my peers profesionally academically relationship wise. I am 27 now and things haven't really improved.Everytime I try to share these emotions with someone namely my mother she just brushed them off and made no big deal out of them. Telling me to just man up basically. When I shared them with friends they either said nothing or told me to get over it.. as such I bottle these feelings because it seems to be a nuisance to other people. Fucking assholes.I feel envy profesionally because I do not work in the places I wish to work and for positions I want to work at. I am underpaid working a job I have grown out of for years.Relationship wise I barely have any friends anymore after college. No partners due to me not taking the initiative to do so. Not due to lack of confidence but due to constant daydreaming and fantasizing about being in a relationship instead of actually pursuing it.I do not feel like an independent person up till recently I was living with my parents and just now am learning to live on my own. I wanted this to be sooner but due to my own lack of initiative and financial struggles I was not able to.I have been addicted to pornography and videogames ever since I was a teen. Just now I am trying to fix these issues. But its hard man... really hard after 15 years of constant use. Makes me feel disgusting. Full of hatred. But at any inconvinience or struggle I immediately resort to these two things.Lately I have been suffering from mood swings from manic anger and anxiety to relative peace serenity and reflection. Within the same hour even. I have also seemed to garner small panic attacks at the most ridiculous and inconsequential things that happen to me. I talk to myself. Alot. Alot alot over the years. For about a couple years now this self talk has turnt more negative over time. Insulting my own capability and intelligence at any mistake.There have also been times...in which I contemplated suicide... but not seriously. Just the idea of ending it all has crossed my mind.I dont really know why I wrote this. I guess I also have been feeling lonely.,Depression
48040,48022,I hate this life I am 14yr old and I have been into depression more than a year . And today I had a thought of killing myself . My friends are upset because of me my parents are disappointed becuz of me . I am monster .,Depression
48047,48029,How do you cope with jealousy? I have no friends at this point due to either my own mistakes or just things not working out. I had a falling out with my family so I'm essentially NC with them and on top of that I recently moved to an entirely new state. I had to sell a lot of my belongings that helped me cope with my depression such as my laptop and PS5. My partner is a fantastic person and the moments I get to spend with him everyday are a blessing. He has similar issues but I insisted he kept his computer since that's his lifeline. On top of that he has numerous social circles who adore him.I've been having a terrible depression spout just due to the new location and lack of socializing and it stings when I'm awake at night sad and alone and I hear him talking to one of his many friend groups. They play games have fun just hang out. He'll do this all night and I have to sleep and wake up to him having fun.I asked him to keep his belongings and I love that he has friends but I just get so upset that he has things that I just cannot have a loving family friends who would never replace him games he can play it makes me so irrevocably depressed that I just can't have those things for some reason. I have autism ADHD and social anxiety and I try to communicate my jealousy to him but at the end of the day it isn't his problem. I want him to be happy but I'm upset that he can do these things which is shitty of me to even feel.How do I get over it? How do you even make friends when you're just a piece of shit person with no good qualities? I'm tired of being so damn lonely. What's the point of doing things if I can't even share them? I love to read and write but I'm not even motivated to do those things because I can't talk about them to anyone.It got so bad last night I burned myself with a lighter took some Tylenol PM and just slept despite sleeping all day already.I don't know what to do.,Depression
48050,48032,Need advice My therapist is pushing me to come out to him and belives that this is the source of all my issues. Am not ready for that yet and I know that not all my issues exist because of this. I want to discuss other topicsissues with him but he keeps redirecting the conversation to my orientation and I don't want to talk about that!! Am having difficulty communicating with him and I don't know what to do! My main issue is something else but he keeps focusing on this topic. What do I do??,Depression
48065,48047,Am i worthy of love Idk man i feel like im too fucked up to be loveable anymoreI have weird feminine mannerisms and limp wrist syndromeCouldnt beat porn addiction and destroyed myself so much that my dick actually seems smallerTrying to roll back alcoholism but instead of relapsing and actually drinking i get high off of sniffing concentrated hand sanitizerSometimes i sleep on the floor and hope i dieVery low drive to do anything,Depression
48109,48091,Noodle arms Skinny Shaming With hot weather approaching.. cant necessarily wear a hoodie anymore. I hate my noodle arms. Im 140 lbs 511 yes skinny af I know. I want to start working out but have 0 motivation. Too anxious to go to a public gym. I constantly get skinny shamed. Things like you need to eat a cheeseburger well if youd eat youd gain weight your skinny as a pretzel skin and bones skeleton etc etc. I could go on for days with the amount of things people have said about me being skinny. Im over it. I have a super fast metabolism and I literally eat 35 meals plus snacks a day. Im just so tired of being skinny and being shamed for it. I feel like a lump of bones with skin. At least people have convinced me thats all I am,Depression
48120,48102,Feel like a loser because of how broke I am at almost 30 years old I'm 28 right now and I graduated from college in the Fall 2017 with a bachelors degree in psychology and after realizing I wasn't going to do much with that degree as I've completely lost interest in that field. Since 2018 I have been working as a parttime student advisor making less than 20k annually as I was very undecided about the direction my life was going to go and it was like this for 2 years until I decided to return to college to take prerequisite courses for graduate school so that I can get into a data science graduate program. I'm currently in my program right now and I have been keeping a 4.0 GPA and this gives me a lot of hope but I've noticed that some of my friends including my love interest make much more money than I do and have their own places. My love interest told me that I will eventually get out of my situation and we still had very passionate sex when I last visited him and we exchanged our gratitudes for each.But its like I'm very disappointed at myself for allowing myself to be where I am today. If I had known from the beginning just how much my socioeconomic status would affect my prospective friendshipsrelationships I would have taken things more seriously and considered a field that was more lucrative when I was an undergrad.,Depression
48124,48106,Where can I get some guidance? I feel so empty and I just dont know where to turn now.,Depression
48134,48116,I wish my brain would leave me alone Just stop with the negative thoughts and feelings. Just leave my mind in peace for once. Leave me alone.,Depression
48139,48121,Should I focus on my mental health first or my academic studies ? I am a Med student who is struggling a lot with anxiety and depression I havent went to a therapist yet but I am planning to soon however I am feeling guilt that maybe instead I should spend more time on studying or find ways to improve my academic performance because its not well and is partially the reason I am depressed.Anyways in conclusion I am wondering should I first deal with my mental health or my academics ?I have also been suicidal thats probably important to mention.,Depression
48164,48146,Hate being sober I guess Im a poly addict but rn its alcohol. I just turned 21. Im wasting my life away drinking everyday no job I have one passion and its music but I dont see it going anywhere. My gf is an alcoholic who blames me for her alcoholism. She asked if she could punch me in the face tonight. Called me a loser cuz I said she needed help. Idk I guess Im just venting but Im so lost and I feel like no one cares. My mom sends me 50 a week so I wont bother her thats how I get my alcohol. I feel like such a bum loser cant even hold down a job let alone show up to an interview. Its a cop out for sure but its because my anxiety. I get anxiety everywhere Im scared of shit like getting blown up Everytime I stop to fill up on gas. Im scared of a gas line exploding at a food service place. I cant even be outside with panic attacks that Im gonna be struck by lightning. I just need help and idk where to turn it feels like everyone hates me or is disappointed. I feel like I wont be here much longer I cant deal with the anxiety or stress or apathy or anything I cant do it anymore. I guess this is just a vent and Im sorry if it breaks any rules but damn life is just weird and sad and I dont get it. 21 btw if that makes a difference,Depression
48174,48155,The worst symptom of depression for me is low self esteem. Because its so obvious. Lets face it no one likes someone who isnt comfortable in their own skin its why people gravitate towards social enthusiastic people who love themselves these types of people are managers well respected individuals with families.Im bright capable yet Im completely and utterly held back for the simple fact I hate myself. No one wants anything to do with me you dont get a sympathy card in life either you love yourself and others will want to know you or no one gives a shit and you are a weird creepy quiet loser.,Depression
48189,48169,Constantly held back by not feeling worthy of getting better. I've been depressed for a few years now. I don't feel totally lost. Somewhere inside me I still have hope I still have a real belief that it's possible for me to feel normal and happy again. But there's a much stronger feeling an overwhelmingly powerful one that even if I could be happy again I don't deserve it. I don't deserve support from others I don't deserve to make small gains for myself. Every time I start to move in a positive direction every time others give me advice and offer help every time it seems like I'm finally digging myself out of the hole.... I stop myself. I hurt myself. I don't let myself get better because I feel like I don't deserve to be better. I hate it. It feels totally inescapable. No matter what progress or advantage I'm giving I end up deliberately damaging it and tossing it away because I can't escape the feeling that I deserve nothing but suffering that it's an injustice to the world if I get better.Does anyone else feel this way? Is there any way to feel worthy?,Depression
48192,48172,I feel my soul is deadvery damaged I hurt her deep deeply. She was the love of my life and I threw it away for casual sex.We were so connected. On such a deep level. We were miles apart yet I could feel her in my soul. All the time. We were one.And I hurt her deeply.I cared for her showed her new things loved her wanted the best for her.But alcohol brought out my shallowness.Its not the fact that its over.Its seeing her face of devastation when I told her every time I close my eyes.She has told me to forgive myself and move on.But I just cant. I would do anything to take back what I did.I would trade 1000 lifetimes for one minute with her.I am at my lowest right now.,Depression
48194,48174,I just want to rant about my depression and anxiety from my depression I talk a lot I get it from people not wanting to talk to me as a child or telling me I talk to much when I share something I enjoyed. Which created childhood depression and it effected me in several ways and still does 14 years later Im 19 to put that into perspective to just how long Ive had dealt with this. One of my earliest memories is wanting to become a smart muggle witch like Hermione from Harry Potter. I was so exited about the films I would talk to almost everyone I came across about HP well almost everyone told me I cantI will never be able toothats badect but more than anything they would tell me I talk to much it isnt ladylike to speak that much. I was 5 years old. As the years went by I was told not to speak often and anytime I spoke about anything I knew something of such as history or science and especially if I was excited about it I would be cut off and told I spoke to much. All of my friends growing up would ignore me in groups or not pay attention if I wanted to join the conversation. Bc of that I became a wall flower and I over tall when people talk to me. I get very depressed most days due to my excessive talking. I know my excessive talking is coming from anxiety but the depression of feeling alone hurts more. Thank you for reading this if you do read this.,Depression
48195,48175,Im so sad Ive been with my bf for almost 10 years and I feel like my relationship is at its end . We have no patience for one another . We are so aggressive to each other . He used to be abusive but hasnt hit me in almost a year . Im so scared to be alone but I know I cant stay like this forever . What do I do ?,Depression
48211,48191,i think whats depressing isworking out the bugs to find a job i need a car i need a job to put gas in it i need a job for insurance i dont have a job i have a car i could lose and walk to work somewhere close but no a car is required reliable transportation. then theres home i need a job for a home my family uses narcotics i dont want to live with them nor be thrown out again soo i still cant find a job that will let me work in peace i dont have any career anything is fine as long as i dont have to be happy i cant fake it.,Depression
48220,48200,29M. Moved out for the first time in August to work at a ski resort for a year. I feel so lonely and have no real friends here. not saying people here are fake but Ive become more of a hermit. Want to move back home and pursue schoolingcertification medical billing and coding. Feeling insanely depressed here.So I made the move out here last year 2 months before turning 29. At first I enjoyed it. Im able to buy weed whenever I want I get a better pay than I did back home and I dont feel like a child living at home. And the weather was pretty nice.But over time it started wearing on me. I miss my nieces and every time weve factimed they look so much older. I feel sad that Im not there. I miss my family and our family dog. Also I ran out of my ADHDanxietydepression medications and havent tried finding a new psychiatristtherapist because I dont want to deal with the hassle of searching around. I feel like I havent really connected to anyone here. I thought going out and snowboarding here at the resort almost everyday that someone would recognize me and Id make friends which is what happened back home but it hasnt happened. I have no dating life at all. I get 3 or 4 days off a week and spend them alone. Sometimes Ill game with my high school friends online which is the only thing I really look forward to but this fucks my sleep schedule even more.I work overnights and barely get any social interaction anymore. I try sleeping during the day but its difficult because my neighbors like to play their music super fucking loud. Why dont they just wear headphones?My sleep schedule is shit. I hate going to run errands because I have to walk 15 minutes to my car. I snowboard for like 2 hours and then feel like going home because I get overwhelmed by the lengthy lines.Once the season ends theyll switch me back to evenings as opposed to overnights but then Ill have to get a roommate. Having a roommate in these tiny ass dorms is horrible and I dont like it. No privacy at all.When I go back home I want to start regularly going to therapy again but am thinking how can I do that if I dont have a job. How do I ensure I have a job when I get back home? I dont live there right now so how the hell do I get interviews????,Depression
48234,48214,I feel things getting bad again For context 2022 was the YEAR of my life. I lived abroad and had a blast. My anxiety was still there but at a minimal. I never felt so happy. So happy at times I felt like I was going to burst. It was insane. February of this year I came back home. Home isn't a good place for my mind. My parents are awful and I always feel like I'm dorwning when I'm home. I've been home since February and I feel things going dark again. I'm sleeping way too much. Have no energy or desire to do anything and the awful thoughts of mot living are coming back. I'm in between places right now. Kicking off a new career that's why I came home. But things are going slow and I cant move away right now. I feel like I was on the bery top of life and now I'm in rock bottom again. I'm lost and confused and my mind keeps things how easy it would all be if I just want living anymore. I dont want to have these thoughts or feel this way.,Depression
48241,48221,Depression? Im 23 years old and used to be happy and had motivation and wanted to work and do things. Last couple of years Ive had no motivation its hard to work I feel lazy I feel slow I can barley talk to people without sounding stupid and its hard for me to listen and remember what people are saying to me. Basically I just always feel tired and slow and no motivation. I know Im a smart person but I feel dumb at the Same time like its hard for me to learn things but once I do learn it Im really good at it. I also feel like I have issues learning because I overthink things and think I will fuck up somehow and think about how there is no way I can do this. I was off work for a long time due to COVID fucked up sleep schedule etc. and then I got laser eye surgery I got almost every complication from it made me really depressed and then I lost my job for not getting fired also made me really depressed cause Ive been there for 8 years. Now I just feel like shit and dont know if its actually depression and a problem. Lasik and COVID really fucked me.,Depression
48252,48232,People with depression are strong as fuck. Seriously every single one of us are fucking warriors. From the monumental effort it takes to drag ourselves into consciousness when we just want to sleep forever to showing up at work amp pretending you havent spent the morning crying or thinking of hurting yourself or wanting to just check out permanently or all of the above.I know its horrible that we do have to deal with it but taking a second to recognize how monumentally tough we are is important I think as we always get stuck on the things we hate about ourselves.It is one positive thing that every person reading this who is battling depression the absolute Herculean strength we have is absolutely incredible.If youre reading this you are incredible the strength you show every single day is something that most people cant even fathom.I had a bad day today amp wanted to try amp shed some positivity on it amp share that with anyone else struggling right now. You are brilliant.,Depression
48264,48244,Canceled once Again My therapy got canceled and I really need it. I got things I want to say and I want to work through this crap I'm going through but my appointments keep getting pushed and pushed and I'm irritated and I'm angry and I'm furious that I'm in this alone. I want to work through my issues but I can't because i can't talk to anyone and I have to wait 2 weeks for my first damn appointment and it sucks cuz I have school and Its stressing me out. I feel the universe is against me. I hate being told by the universe that this is for my own good and that I must go through this In order to be a better person. it feels like a power over me. Like I'm being controlled by someone. I hate someone controlling me and telling me it's for my own good it's degrading and I hate it and I hate it and hate it and my mind is manipulating me to feel like I need to be kind. My mind is against me and I have to push through even when its against me. I feel like the victim I hate being the victim I can feel sad in peace because I have a mind that sabtoges me. I wish I could just be unaware and feel my feelings without having to play devils advocate with myself thus nullifying or undermining my feelings. My mom is being a bitch she litrally doesn't understand that her words hurt but she laughs like it's funny and she makes me want to hit her because fuck that shit hurts and I want to hurt you the way you are fucking hurting me. I need help they say reach out for help but help has a schedule and she need you to wait till she's is available. Why do I have to follow these rules i hate these damn rules.,Depression
48286,48266,Help. I'm in a situation worse than killing myself. I can't seem to talk to anyone truthfully about how I feel. No one respects me anymore. Give importance to what I do respect my job see my importance or even care about how I feel. I'm so frustrated to the point that I can only hurt myself but can't kill myself. I have a little boy that keeps me going but I don't know up until when or how far I can go. I'm trapped in this cycle for years with no resolution.,Depression
48299,48279,this isnt the same place even though its literally the same place physically. When I look back 1 year ago for example its not so much that it feels like life has changed but more like its absolutely not the same reality. Im in the exact same house that I was in the exact same rooms and the exact same backyards but its just not the same place. It felt like a different world despite there being very few things different from the environment.It generally isnt very distressing but it gets in the way when I wanna be happy again. I dont know how to completely explain this phenomenon but I do know that its mental.,Depression
48302,48282,Just want to be high and never leave my apartment for the rest of my life... Honestly I feel like God's longest running joke and I'm just tired of it. Everything has always felt empty and hopeless. My dad died before I was born my mom went crazy I invested all my teen years in caring for her that I now I have no idea who I am or have any social skills and now she's dead. I thought it would help me move on but a few months after my boyfriend cheated on me and I left to a a new town for school. Since coming here I've only come to realize I'm not anything my only reason to exist was to care for my mom and now that's gone there's no purpose for me. I'll never be normal like everyone else. Never fit in. Never be pretty or smart or liked. I'm just worthless now. I really want to just give up. Each day I'm more and more tempted to withdraw from college and live off my inheritance the rest of my life never leaving my apartment and only getting high to feel something more than regret and depression.,Depression

27382,27402,During the pregnancy and after the traumatic birth of our first child in 2013 symptoms started to intensify including lots of depression some manic behavior and periodic angry outbursts. Somewhere in there we settled on a very relatively speaking effective combination of mental health meds that stabilized symptoms. We had our second child in 2015 after which an injury led to the discovery of a debilitating and incurable connective tissue disorder. The symptoms from this have been getting worse since then and a good chunk of time from 2015 until now has been discovering whats going on coming to grips with a new reality and managing those symptoms. Overall weve had a very healthy supportive relationship with strong shared values.,Normal

Anyway so we were roommates in a super tiny apartment that didnt even have a living room just our two bedrooms divided by a kitchen.

50511,50667,How do you deal with making mistakes? Like breaking stuff thats not yours or forgetting to do something important. Im a perfectionist and every time I screw up it kills my mood and sends me into a spiral of self loathing. Suicidal thoughts appear immediately. Cant help but see myself as an antiMidas and thats one thought that usually proves itself to be true.I just had a bit of a fuck up. Dont care to go into detail about it but moments like this are why avoidance makes sense. It never wouldve happened if I didnt take the chance.,Personality-disorder
50519,50676,Hypochondria Who here has hypochondria?,Personality-disorder
50522,50679,I got in a bad car accident the other day and the worst part is having to talk to insurance people on the phone maybe this isnt the best place to post this but literally why am I like this? I couldve fucking died and Im more scared of talking to people on the phone. maybe Id find it a little funny if it wasnt so pathetic. arent normal people supposed to be more traumatized about the actual crashnear death experience? meanwhile Im over here basically having a panic attack over having to talk to people over the phone about it. this is ridiculous.,Personality-disorder
50528,50686,I'm screwed maybe many of you are too? One thing I'm aware of is after you've been disconnected from societal norms for a few years it seems very difficult to return. I tend to stay away from looking at other people's lives overall it is good but you also need an awareness of how far adrift you are and the standard you're compared against.The average person is socially active whereas were disengaged. They have a constant stream of chores hobbies events plans messaging circles. In a day some days I speak to no one and can't even find the motivation to do anything new even something like watching a movie I can put off. My point is that after a while when you look at the ''activity level'' of a normal average person I just feel inadequate. This is made worse reinforced by the fact that whenever i do try connect with others I get rejected thats because they can sense pretty early I have nothing going on for myself in these social areas and I am not so much like them. And thats the catch22 because people excluding you stops you ever having anything.I'm incapable of organising a fun life things like viewing someone in family gathering and getting along with large groups of people and creating a good impression are intimidatingnearly impossible for me. I'm behind in career life experiences life skills energy. It's just difficult to even get a footing iv been cut away for so long and many types have closed the door on me,Personality-disorder
50543,50702,Finally deactivated Facebook. Where I am from everybody is on Facebook. That anxiety inducing place where I never feel safe and I feel hated invisible and dumb. Lately I've been spiralling and posted sad angsty posts to people who don't care about me. Thankfully I got only 60 friends. Facebook made me feel more alone. I'm disabled and I don't go outside and I struggle with texting. I just don't get it. I don't have the energy. I kept deleting my posts feeling more ashamed. I need it for something that's work related and still ongoing. But enough. I don't care if everyone is there I rather not feel like a burden and vent on Reddit. Having a profile with my name and face while I am utterly depressed? No thanks. It's not like I made any friends there. I really hope that my issues will be resolved and I won't go back and make a fool outta myself because no one cares.,Personality-disorder
50546,50705,Once people get to know me they tend to love me... They only problem is they never get to know me because the only possible way they will is if I am forced to be in a situation with repeated exposure to them in which case I become familiar and slowly open up over the span of a week or two. It's downright disturbing how many times this has happened in my life and it's depressing to think that those opportunities are few and far between now that I'm out of the primary environment they occur school. I was so desperate at one point that despite having everything people normally strive for great career money success etc. I thought about joining the army just to meet people... Holy shit what is wrong with me.,Personality-disorder
50558,50719,I suspect myself of having AvPD I am turning 17 in a month and a half and I suspect myself of having AvPD I am trying to do more research on the disorder I am not going to self diagnose but I am hoping people who are diagnosed can tell me more about the traits and what its like having AvPD.,Personality-disorder
50563,50724,Why is AVPD considered a personality disorder and not a mental illness? So from what i have read seems like AVPD is the only pure egodystonic personality disorder and usually personality disorders are seen as a flaw in someone's personality and are egosyntonic in nature but in the case of AVPD seems like no one likes to have this condition. So why isn't AVPD considered a mental illness because the symptoms of someone with AVPD seems to match up with different things like social anxiety and extreme low self esteem? Like the symptoms are basically the same in a lot of ways.,Personality-disorder
50601,50766,Im mostly so avoidant due to being ashamed of my appearance and feeling like I dont belong. Anyone else feel the same way? Im a below average looking guy and I just want to be normal looking. I feel like my AVPD has gotten worse over time because I am just too ugly for life.,Personality-disorder
50628,50794,Just wonder if people have heard of hypersensitivity. Im a Highly Sensitive Person or HSP but I realized I was being super sensitive for awhile now. I think this is when I started to realize my AvPD. I was talking to my former therapist a couple of months back and she told me about it. Her friend had become disabled and was being hypersensitive. I think a lot of this comes from trauma. Also doesnt help when people arent really compassionate in general. I dont really have much advice but try to heal from traumas. Ive been doing that alot more lately. It took a really long time but I feel less stuck now.,Personality-disorder
50644,50811,is there a point in trying to completely get over this shit i try so hard to get close to people and basically no ones ever responsive and literally no one gives more than baseline politeness. i expend so much energy trying and nothing comes of it. all i get is hurt because people dont care about me at all. it hurts so much to try and get nothing and rejection in return.I'm genuinely wondering if there's really any point in me continuing to try when nothing works out and i just end up in so much pain. i want to just give up and isolate to save energy and prevent this fucking god awful pain i keep feeling over and over again every time something social comes upi understand part of this hopeless feeling is my unrelenting depression but ive quite literally never been able to develop true close relationships outside fucking elementary school and im 21 now,Personality-disorder
50656,50824,The bar is so low I can't even begin to describe it. All I know how to do is play video games watch youtube and repeat the same things like a dumb monkey.The past 2 weeks I tried taking a course in computer science and I tried starting to learn Japanese. And all I can do is watch and wait for something to click in my brain.There's nothing in me. No creativity no selfsufficiency no capacity for independent thought.I don't understand how I've made it this far.I'm scared. I'm terrified. I don't know what to do with myself anymore.,Personality-disorder
50663,50834,as to not be a burden i will now isolate myself. you are welcome! recently I've been distancing from my friend because I needed some space. but after a while I noticed they seem... happier without me. like actually laughing and smiling more they even started talking to a very cool person. and they even talk to other ppl in the group more often. so now I'm kinda isolating myself because well... i just want them to be happy. if being absent from their life is what will make them happier ill do that. seems like I'm just a toxic person that drains everyone around them.,Personality-disorder
50670,50842,How to deal with rejection when you have avpd? I feel like I'm dying like there's a hole in my chest and thoughts make me feel like I'm falling in. I'm also having very negative thoughts I'm realising I'm angry at myself for being vulnerable enough for this to happen to me. Please help if you've been through this...I see no hope. P.s I mean rejected after asking a girl out I've been talking to for months.,Personality-disorder
50683,50856,I went to a party! I actually went to a garden party! There were tiny sandwiches a bunch of fruit and little cracker plates with meats and cheeses. I actually felt comfortable the whole time!I've been on some medicine these past few weeks I can't remember the name and I think they may actually be working. I still get depressed andor anxious around the night time or when I'm not doing something. I just have to keep myself busy and I'll be okay.But about the party. I knew almost everyone there I've known them for a long time now and they're closer to me than my family. I helped set up the party so I didn't feel like I wasn't being useful I took my time this morning in making sure I looked presentable and of course I showed up early just in case. The party lasted about an hour and a half and I even got to talk with some of the people there! Today is just a great day so far and not if but when things start to go back down to normal I hope I don't forget that I was able to be happy today. I know progress can jump forward just as much as it falls back but I'm going to celebrate today as progress!,Personality-disorder
50706,50883,Id rather be alone than feel like this Went on a date a week ago for the first time in years. Normally I am not attracted to people but this time I felt super attracted to this person. Good talks and the whole day we spent together. We had sex but I did not sleep at that persons place bc thats too intimate for me I see sex a something purely physical but sleeping is too scary for me. However that person didnt text me for a week so I texted to ask to go to a concert with a mutual friend. Still no response for 2 days. I feel so insecure and rejected and it confirms the negative view I already have about myself. I really would like to have a relationship and fall in love but even dating makes me feel so worthless ugly stupid and anxious even after one date. Sorry for the vent but this is the only place I feel I can share this. Other people say that I just need to relax stop overreacting and stop being insecure and blablabla. Thats why I never share these feelings with people,Personality-disorder
50710,50887,Is it okay to appear rude to others? I find it extremely anxiety inducing to be disliked and appearing rude or non caring elicits this reaction from others.The funny thing is I am continually day after day in my attempts not to appear this way am this way. I don't give solid eye contact to others mere glances I hide myself away in plain sight with poor meek body language I carry myself without confidence to avoid interactions.All in vain attempts of appearing in my delusional mind 'nice'. It is so self destructive you essentially let people walk over you ignore you in some desire to be liked. By people who dislike you will come to dislike you as a result of your behaviours or simply horrible people who you wouldn't want to like you. Let me give an example of what I'm thinking. You're shopping for groceries you want to look at a shelf which is currently occupied by someone else you need something on that shelf like a tin of food or something. Usually I will see this and think 'oh my god don't want them to know I need something there' heavens forbid if they see me what will they think? So I quickly change direction and pretend to look at other items until they move.So instead why not stand in their shadow and wait patiently let your presence be seen in an ideal world ask them to make space if you know exactly what you need but that would come when you're more confident? So yes stand next to them and don't budge just let them know non verbally you're waiting.Another example you're at the cashier they're doing your items I always look everywhere but where I need to look I lose focus on what I should be looking at which is the items I'm paying for the cashiers eyes in case they're trying to communicate something. And what if they say something small talk for instance well maybe I'm not in the mood to pursue further small talk so why not just give closed answers why do I feel the need to fill the silences to say whatever I can to appear 'normal'. I come across as flustered shy unconfident I see it in their faces they see the fear they see the disgust on my face believing I'm a wrongin or something but it's really just negativity brewing inside of me of being in such a anxiety inducing situation that causes these expressions on my face then they mirror it. And I think awful things about myself. So why not stay calmer speak slower not try and have a positive small talk experience just take things at my own pace. Otherwise I leave feeling utterly embarrassed ashamed and the next time I shop there and there my cashier they're going to hate that I'm there. As opposed to being more stoic and less nervously chatty.I'm rambling a bit losing focus on my words sorry but some of that probably doesn't make sense. I hope you get the type of rude I'm talking about. It's not purposefully being rude. It's more being true to yourself being comfortable in your own body and standing up to be counted as an equal. Something I avoid.Any ideas or experiences suggestions on these niche topic please?,Personality-disorder
50754,50935,anyone else feel like isolationconstant lack of interaction is turning them into a hateful person? I mean i do have various have mental issues but i think chronic isolation in particular is a big part of why I'm growing into such a bitter and hateful person.Objectively it's not really much of a problem because i'm alone all the time so it's not like i'm being actively hateful or offensive towards others. But yeah basically it seems that whenever i hear sth concerning other people be it celebrities or strangers on the internet or whatever i am either jealous or upset. these are my only reactions i don't empathise anymore. it's kinda starting to affect my beliefs as well but I'm aware that it's more of an emotional issue than anything and I don't plan on being alive for much longer so no need to worry about that,Personality-disorder
50767,50948,must bargain with the universe for social plans so my 18ftm coworker evilyn 19f was going to see a band at a music venue an hour away she posted to her instagram story about needing a ride i offered to take her because i want to get out of the house. she said she'd be down and now i'm just waiting for her to respond so we can plan stuff on SC. she mentioned having extra tickets but i'm still buying my own because she didn't directly offer it to me and i don't want to embarrass myself in case it's not implied. they're like 15 each so it's not outlandish or anything. and i'm too afraid to ask to clarify like so if i'm going too would you give me one of your extra tickets? it's not unreasonable i know if i were her i wouldn't mind the question but i'd feel like a terrible person for asking even if we were closer. also not going to clarify that this is 100 platonic because we're coworkers and i think she knows i'm gay the one thing i miss about presenting female is that i never had to make those distinctions with other girls. but will live in fear of that misunderstanding nonetheless. another fear evilyn is on pretty friendly terms with jonah 20M our other coworker a the one and only person ive ever romantically pursued lots to unpack with that but for brevity's sake let's not. as in they've hung out outside of work more than once. now i don't think jonah is the petty type but if evilyn mentions it to him i wouldn't put it past him to say something idk what but not sure he likes me much at the moment that would make her back out. and if that were the case she'd just make an excuse so i would never really know. rambling post but i wanted to talk about my fears somewhere. this is the closest i will get to feeling hyped about hanging out with someone. mainly in my own head i have to earn outings by going over everything that could go wrong and by being of use ie giving her a ride without expecting a free ticket. yeeeah it's a lot. thanks for reading all ,Personality-disorder
50768,50949,DAE avoid taking care of your appearance? I don't mean personal hygiene. Like avoiding skincare not caring abt your hair dressing as baggy and blandly as possible not doing makeup. I just desperately don't want any attention. I don't want girls to comment anything about my cute outfit I don't want men to stare at me. I want to be invisible,Personality-disorder
50776,50957,when i hear my name called i feel extremely uncomfortable and i feel like i did something wrong. i dont know if this has anything to do with AvPD or noti'm 20 years old and i think i suffer from Avpd u can check my other posts herethis is a problem i noticed recentlylets say I'm talking to someone and if shehe calls me by my name i feel extremely uncomfortable i feel like i did something wrong so i dont want to talk anymore and end the conversation there. it happens both in real life and online. if someone says my name its a big turn off for me. normally people dont even know my name people in my class etc. they dont use my name at all. i just wonder is there anyone here in the same situation?,Personality-disorder
50780,50961,does anxiety play a part in your avpd? i have anxiety disorders one being social anxiety so i experience a lot of anxiety with my avpd. when it comes to social situations my anxiety is so high that im sweating heart is pounding and it feels like my brain shuts down completely. it causes me to fail so badly at socializing even more than i already would it doesnt give me time to hear what people are saying or to give myself the time to think of a response. its embarrassing how i react internally cause it causes me to react externally in a way i wouldnt want to. id like my brain to be calm and relaxed so that i can properly think of my reactions and responses but nope i end up looking like a fool which leads to more self hate and feelings of ineptness. does anyone have experiences like this?,Personality-disorder
50814,50999,Is getting diagnosed with AvPD worth it? So correct me if Im wrong about any of what Im about to say. I noticed that the treatment for AvPD is cbt which would be pretty much the standard treatment for a lot of mental health problems. So is it worth going through the process of being diagnosed with AvPD when you could just be diagnosed with something like say anxiety and still get the same treatment options? Again if Im wrong dont hesitate to correct me. Thanks and have a great day.,Personality-disorder
50827,51012,here goes nothing Would anyone in their early 20s like to chat occasionally? Maybe even be friends? I literally talk to no one I figure maybe the social interaction could be beneficial,Personality-disorder
50837,51022,I act like a child and idk if it's just me or because of avpd People have commented before on this and what it is is that I basically look up to people in the way a child would look up to an adult and I do this because I admire how other people my age act like real adults and are confident and capable of doing adulty things. I absolutely am not a real adult despite my age.I also tend to want these people to look after me a bit make me feel safe protect me from other people because I view them as competent whilst I'm essentially an over grown child. I suppose this could stem from childhood trauma where I didn't feel protected maybe so I now try to hide behind other people to feel safe. I don't know if anyone else experiences this. I've never seen anyone talk about something like this before so I fear I'm just a complete weirdo . I'm not sure if this is actually a sign I have dependent personality disorder or something instead of being avpd related. Hopefully you guys can let me know if this is avpd related or not.,Personality-disorder
50838,51023,feeling better then worse again i know recovery is never an uphill slope but it still feels like shit when you take steps back. after getting little to no socialization for the past decade ive been really pushing myself to get out there more. ive joined a peer support organization for people with mental illness and ive been going multiple times a week. some days i feel like im making progress by challenging myself to engage in conversation and when it goes well it feels nice. but thats not every time... sometimes like today i feel like i dont belong and shouldnt be there. there were so many people today i just felt invisible and like i didnt matter so there was no point to even trying to make conversation. maybe it was too overwhelming or i had nothing to add to any coversations and yet i still feel like im back at square one. logically i know im not because im still going to keep trying but it just hurts to feel this way. to always feel like youre invisible and shouldnt exist. i dont want to feel like this. i want to have friends so badly its painful to be this lonely. i want to belong. and yet... i still believe i wont. im not giving up. it just sucks personality disorders suck!,Personality-disorder
50870,51060,I really miss having friends I think about old friends every single day always reminiscing about the good old days where I used to have people that liked me and I used to laugh a lot and make memories I've never since forgotten. I regularly fantasise about still hanging out with old friends I haven't spoken to in over a decade making up memories that never happened just trying to forget that are not part of my life anymore. The only times I've ever been truly happy was just being one of the guys where I was invited to things and people liked having me around for some reason I couldn't quite understand. And I just pushed everyone away assuming they all secretly hated me with absolutely evidence to support that claim. Then I spend the rest of my life thinking about them every day hoping some day they might still think of me and reach out cause I definitely am not the one to do it first. I haven't had a friend in years now and my life feels so empty without them they really do fill a massive gap in my life. Feeling wanted and liked by others is the best thing I've ever felt but it never lasts long before they see how really odd I am and a distance starts forming.Anyway sorry for the rant just having one of those days that even though it's exactly the same as every other day it also just feels worse for some unknown reason.,Personality-disorder
50888,51079,It's getting harder to pretend I'll be okay My birthday was last month. I turned 26. I went to a buffet with my mom because she was the only one who remembered. It was nice but the whole time I also had this cold dread in my stomach because this is my life that this is going to be my life forever. And a month out the dread is still here. It's hard to breathe sometimes when I think about how I'm closer to 30 now than to 20 over a quarter of the way through my life by any metric and I have nothing at all to show for it. I still haven't met basic milestones others do in their teens. And I don't see myself meeting them anytime soon. I never learned how to drive. I've never lived on my own. I've never held a job for longer than a year. I've never had a friend let alone a romantic attachment. Most of my hometown is a mystery to me because I've never gone anywhere or experienced anything. And at this point the idea of trying to fix what's wrong is scarier than just rotting away on my own.Sorry for the melodrama. Point being I'm not in a great place right now and it's just getting worse over time. And I can't talk to anyone about it because I don't know anyone except my mom and she really doesn't understand why I can't just force it. To be fair I don't understand either. Thanks for reading and have a good day.,Personality-disorder

50919,51112,Overthinking and feeling powerless in social situations Social situations are nerve wracking because they are unpredictable and I have to come up with responses on the spot. There is also the pressure of the other party potentially manipulating you such as in business situations or when someone is trying to sell something to you.So before these situations I often try to play out all the different paths that the interaction could take place and try to prepare everything for it. This makes each social interaction extremely high effort for little reward in comparison.There are also worst possible outcomes in which there is no way to prepare for and where there is nothing you can do about it. For example suppose I was buying something from a shop I hand over my money and then the shop keeper just ignores me what can I actually do in that situation? Call the cops? Get a lawyer? What proof do I have that the money was mine and I handed it over? What obliges the shop keeper to give me the item I wanted? Normal people never question these dynamics and just put trust in the systems set in place they've never been burned by it so it just works for them. But here I am worrying over every little thing that I'd rather hide away from it all if possible.,Personality-disorder
50936,51130,Failing out of college abusive family Ive been in my apartment now for two months only leaving for food. I know this isnt long but Im the unicorn extrovert with avpd among us. Im supposed to be graduating this semester yet Ive gone to none of my classes or done any of the work. I have no motivation and I feel that I legitimately dont deserve my degree. Im withering away and dont know where to start fixing this mess. It bothers me that Im failing out but not nearly as much as the fear of how my abusive family will react to having to bail me out of trouble again. Never mind how it feels to still be so controlled as an adult. Ive already had to withdraw one semester for mental health purposes and I cannot bear having to admit that Im in an impossible situation once again. And they dont even believe Im mentally ill. I dont need their approval I just need to not be verbally ripped apart. It would take too long to describe how cruel my family can be but it is enough that I am living in a full breakdown trying to keep this lie holding together. My dad once called me a 23 year old loser and I keep proving them right. And yet Id willingly take abuse over the solitary confinement I live in now.

50985,51184,Does anyone else do insane mental gymnastics to get out of going places?

The reason in my head was like hmm they're meeting next week so I can just wait until then surely I will do it next time D It's just Ahhhhhhhhh I hate myself man. Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why am I like thisand the thing is I really need the socialization too like I'm so freaking lonely... the instant I arrive back home I'm like shit I really should've just gone in now I have nothing to do again why did I listen to myself and it just makes me even more depressed thinking about how pathetic I am,Personality-disorder
50986,51185,claustrophobia attacks Can anyone relate to this no advice please? So I don't live alone I live a single family member that sometimes has their boyfriend over. I also do work part time in retail which is all I can currently handle. Our schedules usually allow me enough time alone even if I want more of it. Summer is a lot better for me because I can comfortably go outside in spaces where I'll be just as alone so it's extremely rare that I have these attacks during it. To get to the point there are some weeks in Winter that are a perfect storm for AVPD. Our schedules will clash where they'll be home every single moment I am for almost a week on end. For the first 34 days I'll get a bit more irritable but handle things and still do ordinary things that involve other people hearing me like music or watching youtube videos and keep up with people well enough online. Though it starts to snowball on 5 usually. The way it comes on is almost like a physical illness. I suddenly feel extremely on edge in the background I'll start not listeningwatching anything and avoiding doing anything outside my room hypervigilance shoots through the roof my mood begins to swing like a pendulum really snappy and in general human.exe stops working. I won't even be able to really handle having Discord open. Usually comes with tension aches too in my body here and there. If I even have to go out and get the mail I become a mental train wreck I won't be able to handle being outside even if no one else is out without being on the edge of a panic attack. just going into a different room becomes an anxiety ridden chore. Going to work as you can imagine as I must force my way through it is an absolute nightmare as you might expect. The anxiety and irritability completely socially cripples me to add to the embarrassment so I go through the usual motions like an NPC to the best of my ability and use that break time very strategically based on how time usually feels there. If I'm lucky I'll loosen up a bit much later at night enough to watch some youtube or enjoy some quieter music. The only way I found to cheat it which costs a little money unfortunately is to order takeout food later for some reason home cooked food doesn't work? I guess it's because I have to do that here with them around and have my usual comfort ritual of watching some youtube as I eat hoping someone is streaming something I like. After that I may feel alone enough somehow to enjoy some music and mindlessly fart around on the internet. Since the only factor is that it just involves someone elses comfort food they made for me I have no idea why this works. It's impossible for this to go on more than a week cause schedules break it up after a week and give me back that time but it can take me a day on my own completely to recover. I noticed this specific family member being home with me too long is the trigger though I don't know if it's just them or others that can trigger these episodes too. It's as if I become to opposite world nightmare version of myself because normally despite my AVPD and CPTSD I'm much more positive and bubbly in personality. As long as I'm self medicated correctly and have just enough space I tend to do ok socially. I feel more like a wounded extrovert than anything since I desire close connections but at the same time I avoid everything that would lead to any being formed because I feel closed in on very quickly. There's a lot of tug of war that goes on with me internally like this.,Personality-disorder
50992,51192,Thanks for being the community I never dreamt to have so yesterday I had a therapy session and the therapist asked why i think i have no friends.i answered i have interests that few share where i live as i live in a small city so it is hard to have friends or form relations based on interests. also i have no interest in sports and that is the common interest where i live i told him i am part of many online communities but i just lurk as i feel that i don't belong enough to participate in these communities even if they are based on my interestsat that moment i remembered reddit and this community and i felt that i already have a community where i can freely be who i am without fearWhen I joined reddit it was for something tech related then i said why not searching for avoidant and i was expecting nothing but to my surprise i found this sub and it was unbelievable as it is hard to find anything related to avoidanti was new to reddit and navigating it but i was happy as i found people like me.as i kept browsing i started to get related more and more to your posts.

51025,51231,Childhood I just found this group recently and it got me thinking. I feel like I was always this way but it doesn't make sense to me that someone would simply be born this way. One of my first memories was standing behind my parents and somebody asked them What is wrong with him? To which they responded Oh he is just shy.In the first grade during story time I would face against the wall 2 feet away from everybody and just daydream. Never joining in but according to my mom my teacher found it cute so she never said anything.I found it embarrassing at the age of 7 when someone would call their parents mommy and daddy. I would sit with the kids that bullied me during lunchtime because I desperately wanted them to accept me. Up until high school I would constantly go to the nurses office trying to act sick so I could leave and at the very least be able to laydown for sometime.From middleschool to highschool I found my way to kinda fit in which was through humor gained a lot of attention but I only felt like I had 2 real friends this entire time. Even though id spend countless nights crying thinking those friends really hated meAny girl I liked in highschool I would never pursue because I didnt think I deserved them. Im sure everyone here did this though.Since the focus is on childhood im going to stop here but I just find it interesting how for me it seems I was always like this.

51063,51275,What should I do if I strongly suspect AvPD? I've struggled with mentalemotional problems pretty much all my life. Even as a young kid I was very shy and anxious. That morphed into more severe problems as I became a teenyoung adult.Now at almost 30 I'm really frustrated because nothing gets better for me. Doctors keep trying to treat me for depression or anxiety or ADHD which I do have problems with but it seems like there are more fundamental deeply set issues which go unaddressed. I've been interested in psychology since I was a teen and there have been times where I've considered that I might have AvPD before forgetting about it but recently I began researching this in earnest and pretty much every diagnostic criterion strongly fits me. It's kind of scary how well it describes me and how much the posts in this sub reflect my thoughts amp experiences.Where should I go from here? How can I bring this up with my psych or should I bring it up? Would getting a diagnosis be worth it?,Personality-disorder
51067,51279,What to tell my therapist? I have a therapy session today and it basically determines my entire future. Im 19 and currently studying and my school is basically just for people in therapy.

My therapist pretty much told me shed stop seeing me if I didnt show any improvement and I told her that my life would be over if that happened.I wasnt trying to be dramatic its just true. Not only would I be kicked out but I also wouldnt have a school to go to as I cant function in a regular school setting. I know very well that I havent shown any improvement since the last time we spoke and idk what to tell her when she asks me about it.Ive considered lying but Im pretty shit a it.

51093,51310,Want to resign from my job Hey all Im really struggling at the moment and all I can think about is resigning from my role. Im a social worker who provides therapy to childrenadolescents with complex mental health difficulties. Ive been working at the organisation for 11 months now and roughly a week ago I changed my workplace location to be closer to home. Its the same service just a different location. Oh .. and Im acting in a senior position at the new workplace as part of a six month secondment. I thought that starting fresh would make me feel more motivated and confident however Im still feeling like an imposter scared and worried about criticism. Extremely terrified of social interactions too. Just knowing I have to see clients and speak to them gives me major anxiety. Im also on antidepressants and beta blockers which help a bit but I still dread the work that I have to do.All I keep thinking about is waking up in the morning switching off my mobile phone and driving far away to a relaxing environment like a beach pretending I have no responsibilities or cares in the world. I know thats not possible though.If I did resign I would make sure never to find a therapy role again as its not something Im too keen on and social interactions terrify me. Should I keep trying to work in spite of the anxiety I experience? I think Ive given it a fair shot and I cant take it anymore! Any advice would be greatly appreciated.. thanks!,Personality-disorder

51106,51327,How did you get a therapist andor an official diagnosis? I've decided to finally take action and try and get some kind of diagnosis so I'm not just relying on my internal monologue or the internet to deal with this thing.I tried therapy once in the past with a therapist who came highly recommended and it just didn't go great. After one too many what's the worst that could actually happen? questions I just really felt like they didn't understand. This was before I had the term AVPD to explain.My question is this How did you go about working with someone who actually understands the problem?My guess is I'm being a bit too inmyhead about this but I just don't want to show up to a therapist like a hypochondriac who plugged their symptoms into WebMD and now is 100 sure of their condition. But I also get the impression AVPD isn't as common as some other personality disorders so I want to find someone who will at least have familiarity with it. But nothing shows up when I search for therapists who specialize in it directly. Are there other umbrella terms that help when finding a therapist? Should I just focus on a depressionanxiety doc or maybe one who works with other PDs like BPD? Or am I way off base and plenty of therapists will understand and just had a bad match for my first goaround?Any suggestions or anecdotes for finding the right kind of help are welcome. Thanks in advance!,Personality-disorder
51123,51346,Having no romantic relationships or prospects for one is eating away at me I am 24M and have never experienced anything of the romantic kind not even crushes. I lost my teenage years due to isolation which is usually when people get introduced to this stuff. I've never even had female friends except some cousins.I live in a culture where arranged marriages are the norm. I'm nearing the age when talk about marriage becomes more serious especially for women. But I don't see myself ever getting married. I'll probably KMS before 30.It feels like I will miss out on this part of the human experience because I'm so insecure around women. I saw a post that summarised how I feel perfectlygtI have trouble talking to women in fact I can't even make eye contact with them especially if I find them even a little attractive. I'm scared they'll think I like them and then they'll hate that someone as disgusting as me could like them.I know that going into a relationship won't fix me but it's so gut wrenching knowing that you don't have the skills or prospects that can make it possible. It's stopping me from even trying to make friends with women IF they think I like them they'll probably be disgusted by me. Even though I'm scared to even let myself think that I might like someoneI know that I should try to make friends with women first but I'm afraid they might label me a creep sensing my inexperience with talking to women let alone having female friends or a relationship. It's like I carry this secret with me like a badge of shame and I automatically defer any action about this to prevent myself from the humiliation that will result from it.Is there anyone out here who knows what this is like?,Personality-disorder

She then goes on to say kids these days are so onion skinned which means someone who has shallow tears and then goes on and say I didn't spoil you kids.Didn't it ever occur to her that maybe I'm like this because she abused us as children? That she screams at us every chance she gets? That she didn't treat us with respect and neglected us? It's not just kids these days people have been battling with mental health for hundreds of years it's just popular now because people actually value mental health now and are seeking for help.It's so funny because she acts so caring and worried when talking to my teacher but then acts so judgemental and close minded when talking to me.,Personality-disorder

51163,51389,social anxiety vs avpd what do you guys think of the whole debate around whether social anxiety and avpd are the same disorder? of course we aren't professionals but i think we can still have our own input. i was diagnosed with social anxiety when i was 15 a month after i dropped out of school and became houseboundagoraphobic and because of that i wasnt able to understand the things i was truly struggling nor were the professionals able to understand. when i ended up inpatient for the first time at age 17 i couldnt leave my room until i was forced to wasnt able to talk to other patients or make friends every time i was in hospital or in some sort of program. i had online friends but then i started becoming convinced that they hated me so i ended up ghosting every online friend i had. when i was 18 i discovered what avpd was and i was amazed by how much i related to every single thing about it even more so than i related to the diagnostic criteria of bpd which i was diagnosed with. i brought up the idea of avpd to a psychiatrist last fall and she pretty just said i agree but also mentioned that theres debate on whether social anxiety and avpd are the same disorder so idek if she changed my diagnosis or not which kinda annoys me but whatever. i just think from what i know about social anxiety is that well its obviously anxiety related so it deals more with anxious thoughts surrounding social activities. avpd to me is more so the innate feelings that you are inept and that there is something deeply wrong with you to the core and thats why nobody likes you therefore you stay alone. i just think they're separate things because not everyone with social anxiety experiences that. let me know what you guys think!,Personality-disorder
51165,51391,I firmly believe undiagnosed ADHD is a big part of the reason why I have this disorder Beyond emotional and sometimes physical neglect I always knew something was different about me. And not in a good way. I couldn't relate to my peers growing up and I could never figure out why. I was always too much. Too loud too weird too emotional. I never had the same interests as the other kids around me. Which made me sad because I wanted to but never did Then there's the fact that I couldn't catch on to jokes quickly which made me awkward. My poor attention span and memory made things worse. Sometimes my teacher would ask me to do a favor like grab something from a shelf and I couldn't follow directions. This happened a lot growing up. People getting frustrated with me or thinking there's something wrong with me because I couldn't follow directions. This evolved into a massive fear of being embarrassed. If someone was telling me where to go I'd need a visual. A map or for me to write down their directions because I'll get lost. My short term memory is so bad. I remember my uncle was giving me his phone number we were moving and he had to leave and come back but I needed to be in contact with him. He recited the numbers and I couldn't remember what he said quick enough. I just always felt like I'm slow to process things. I still am. Someone will state a fact about themselves I'll look them in the face and nod like I was listening. But I wasn't so I repeat what they said back to them and they all give me this wtf look and they tell me they just said that a moment ago. Sometimes I forget the things I myself said and it would lead to me repeating myself multiple times. Again ending with people giving me this wtf is wrong with her? Look. Yikes. It doesn't help that I think I deal with rejection sensitive dysphoria. It takes very little for me to get flustered and embarrassed. It led to me lashing out at others as a child which ofc led to me being excluded eventually. I always overexpressed my emotions and I think that was off putting to other people. When I was happy I was very happy. When I felt a twinge of sadness I was crying when I was mad I was yelling and name calling.I had overall weird impulsive behavior. I would say the most random things and make really weird movements I still do but only at home lol. I think all of these things just made others reject me because I was so strange. And to avoid the harsh judgement I started masking all of my quirks but I lost myself in the process. I went from one extreme to the other. Instead of being overly expressive I isolate myself and I come off as cold uncaring and stuck up. But this couldn't be further from the truth. I truly do care about people but I'm emotionally blocked off and still trying to mask those symptoms that make me seem weird Sorry for all the rants and posts lately . I'm not actually sad this time. I think I'm just coming to accept there's a reason why I am the way I am and that I'm not just inherently defective.,Personality-disorder

I constantly delete my social media and start over. By doing this I also ghost all of my friends on Discord. With social media like Reddit Twitch and others creating new accounts isn't a problem for me because I don't post anything. I only keep my Steam account. I always knew it's not normal. I didn't know other people also struggle with this.My friends are annoyed whenever I come up with a new Discord account. I really don't want to talk to them about this. It's hard for me to talk about my feelings with people I know. I feel like they wouldn't understand me andor would judge me. Most of my friends I've known since 2017. I usually just come up with a dumb excuse like I forgot my password or something like that.I want to explain the weird urge I get whenever I feel like disappearing. Under a post there was this commentgtThere was a point where I realized I was getting very good at starting things because after a certain point I would get that urge to restart. Not just with accounts but with everything. I'd plan out how I was going to use an account build a new habit accomplish some goal as efficiently and optimally as possible and for a while follow through. Eventually I would drift off track a little let it eat at me and then give up and decide I'll start over and do it better. At this point I struggle to get to the I'm going to try stage and usually just don't bother. The apathy does help me push through failure or perceived shortcomings a little more.This comment describes my situation very accurately. I feel almost exactly as this guy.Creating new accounts has become a routine. I feel like it even calms me and is the closest thing to running away from everything. It's kind of hard to explain how I feel..I ghosted my friends like 3 weeks ago. Throughout the weeks I've tried to start over but I always fail and just start over once again.. I didn't tell anyone I'll disappear. I deleted my Discord and now I'm gone. My friend texted me on Snapchat asking why I deleted my account. I just responded with something like yeah lol. Didn't even give an answer. Ever since then I haven't talked to them. I want to but I know I'm gonna disappear after a month. I also don't want to explain to them why I deleted my account because I can't even do it right now where I am anonymous.Probably a lot of mistakes very unorganized post but yeah.. I hate this. I just want to be normal. ,Personality-disorder
51177,51404,Progression and regression Hey guys gals and enby pals. Its been a hot minute since Ive posted here. That was on my old account though. My name is Ciara. Im a 25 year old trans girl and I have avpd.obviously lol Since I use to post Ive made some decent progress. I managed to get a job in I shit you not retail. I actually managed to hold it down for a couple months even lol. Heck in a few instances I even was kind of good at it. But eventually I cracked and quit. I could only get ignored or misgendered so many times. Now Im back at square one. I know I can push myself but my endurance seems so fickle. Although I do have some confidence. I know Im not inferior. Took me a long time get there but I know Im gonna have to put myself back out into the world soon. I cant be a neet again. Idk where Im going with this I just kind of felt like venting a bit.,Personality-disorder
51187,51414,I only see two options in my future Abandon my entire life leaving everyone and everything behind. Or just kill myself. Or both.I let the closest friendships Ive ever had die because I cant be a normal person. I never contact people first because I feel like Im rudely intruding whenever I present myself to someone in any fashion. I dont even call my own family members and tell them I love them because it feels like anything I do is placing a burden on others.I dont have a plan I just wanna drive until I run out of money. I just wanna experience what life is like without having the people you know perceive your actions even if its just for a short time before I eventually succumb to my suicidal ideation.,Personality-disorder
51191,51418,Just got home from a party All I did was stand awkwardly by myself in the middle of the room the whole time. Despite drinking and smoking some weed I felt too aware of myself and any potential eyes on me. Im always so utterly restricted I never let myself have any fun never dance never play any drinking games participate in karaoke etc. because I dont want to people to judge how badly I am doing Im scared they would want nothing to do with me if they see how bad at I am at everything. Im literally terrified of any selfexpression and I wish just once I could be normal and let loose and just have fun,Personality-disorder
51221,51450,constantly drawing a blankbrain fog i honestly feel like i've had a brain injury of some sort. in like 80 of conversations even with family members i simply have no idea what to say in a conversation. my mind is a complete blank even in what would be a pretty standard 'easy' conversation. it's like i'm paralysed or something. i either mumble something only to retract it or just say nothing at all. it's awful and it makes me not want to talk to people even more because i don't want to put them in an awkward uncomfortable situation and make them think even worse of me. i'm really pessimistic about ever making friendships or even mere acquaintances nowadays. i literally have nothing to say i feel so socially inept that i just don't bother anymore.it didn't used to be this way either. i was confident talkative i had friends who i'd talk with long into the night. even with people who weren't my friends i could still hold a pretty decent conversation. where did that go? it feels like that part of me just left one day i don't know why or even when it did. it just left.i'm usually pretty fine about this. i don't crave intimacy or friendship and am pretty content by myself. but sometimes it just hits me how screwed i am. a family member had surgery recently and i texted them to see how they were doing. that resulted in them trying to have a conversation what with them being on bedrest and all but my responses were so... bad. they seemed to think so too because they stopped replying haha. i can't blame them in the least for it too. i wish it wasn't this way but i don't think there's much i can do about it either. this blankness it feels like it'll be there forever. like some kind of inpenetrable fog muffling my thoughts blocking off any higher function.DAE experience this kind of thing? does it get better with time? how do you deal with it if at all?,Personality-disorder
51230,51458,Casual dating How do you deal with casually dating? Got out of an long term relationship a few months ago wasn't looking for anything serious and just dating for fun. And then the man I was dating told me he was hitting it off with his ex gf again. And I started to spiral badly down the I'm not good enough hole.. although I'm not even looking for a serious relationship. Sometimes it's difficult to differentiate between normal human experience and my disorder in terms of what are socially expected feelings or behaviors in these kind of situations.,Personality-disorder

51260,51492,Nobody takes an interest in me so I stopped taking an interest in myself For as long as I can remember all my friendships have been due to me taking the initiative. Asking the other person about their life and making plans. If I stop doing this I stop having friends. I wonder what this says about me. The only thing that comes to mind when facing this fact is Am I that reprehensible?. And I know that sounds like I am expecting things of people but isn't a friendship supposed to be a 2way street? I feel so crushingly lonely when I think about all this. There's this video from Kurzgesagt about loneliness and in that they say that the feeling of loneliness has the evolutionary purpose of saving you from the threat of being excluded from the tribe. If these were the days when humans lived in tribes I would basically be deemed to not be worthy of survival.Every friendship that starts has so much at stake for me. I can't face another onesided thing. It's such a slap in the face like I'm not worth knowing. Which is why I avoid investing myself in anything nowadays.These strings of continuous unreciprocated experiences have left me incapable of taking care of myself. Everything I do for myself feels not worth doing. Even talking about myself feels like a waste of time. If I try so hard to be part of the world and it rejects me why should I care to survive at all?,Personality-disorder
51262,51494,I did it I gave up my old life So yeah I did it. Or atleast I am doing it. I dont't know what will happen next. It was always a distant dream of mine to just leave everything behind. Maybe you can relate.I quit my job and my appartment. I left my cozy first world country with a one way ticket to India. Currently I am touring Rajestan on a motorcycle. The only contact to my old life is my family. Even though I would like to cut contact I can't bring myself to do it. It would break my mothers heart.I eat way too much seriously the food is amazing and get stared and begged at alot because i am a western guy. Some days I don't leave my hotel room. Other days I drive 300km on busy roads. You probably know this feeling. The ambivalence is killing me. I love being alone but at the same time I miss not being alone. And often I think doing this was a big mistake. The whole experience is.. meh.. And because I dont know where to go or what to do planning anything is impossible. Right now I have 50k in savings. But what for?The only thing I always hear in my head is Wherever you go there you are. And atleast that's true.Thanks for reading if you have any questions feel free to ask.

51264,51497,Advice for AvPD college students? I'm a sophomore in college and I've totally given up on making friends. My issue isn't with finding a group to fit in with but rather just surviving my classes.

51279,51514,Honestly do you think the label AvPD does you more harm than good? TLDR My therapist says labels might be helpfulempowering for some but might have a negative effect on others. Theres debates about this in the mental health community. It is in fact harmful for me so I have decided to stop seeking diagnosis for now.Recently my therapist told me how mental health labels might help some but have a negative effect on some.This discussion started when I requested a written diagnosis from her.In my case after discussing labels with her I was able to come to the conclusion that I tend to dehumanise myself because of the label.I treat myself as diseased or nuisance and often feel bad for not being as good as normal people.Theres a whole debate even in the mental health community about labels and how sometimes mental health professionals might misuse it.So for now Ive stopped seeking out a diagnosis.

51303,51542,I wish I could be assigned a friend or partner so I had someone to share my life with Mostly I wish I could just skip all the scary beginning stuff of getting to know someone. I like having friends but Im terrified of trying to make new ones. I like socializing but only when its not terrifying. Ive never been in a relationship but it seems nice to have someone to be there for you at the end of the day. I only have my family but they all have their own lives and their own immediate families. I just wish that I had someone outside of my family. I wish I had someone that liked similar things and that I could go do stuff with or someone to eat dinner with most days. I just wish I wasnt so scared of trying to get the things that I want. It feels like a pity party kind of night. ,Personality-disorder

51317,51558,I quit my job without telling my boss So I work as a cashier and this saturday 28th was supposed to be my last day there end of my contract which was going to be renewed but last saturday 21th after my long shift I decided I couldn't go through another week at this workplace so I took all my stuff and left for good without telling anyone.This job has burnt me out so much and gave me panic attacks and I didn't see myself staying there another week. But I was mostly afraid to tell my boss that I didn't want to renew my contract too scared to see disappointment on her face and to let them down... So by quiting early I wouldn't have to face this situation...I didn't show up on Monday and didn't call but I sent to HR a doctor's note from my psychiatrist telling them that I am taking a break from work. My boss has tried to call me yesterday but I didn't respond. I feel shitty right now and I hate this AVPD.... This fear of confrontation and disappointing is killing me.,Personality-disorder

51322,51563,Fear is the death of potential comfort it's instrument. Deep down I'm still that poor scared little boy who lost his confidence beaten and humiliated and alone. So desperately alone Beyond that and deeper perhaps is a skeleton where the man should be held together by wishes and fantasies of what it means to be of what it means to deserve and the empty bravado and bloviations of a synthetic confidence made of air. Now I can play the role of the confident man. I can laugh and smile and charm and begile and speak with an iron certainty that brooks no argument and most would be tricked into thinking this is strength but these are nothing more than the desperate craven thrusts of defense a pained and insecure theatre to hide my own inadequacy from inquiring eyes. I feel so worthless so replaceable so expendable. If I am not the absolute best then how can I be valuable at all? How can someone not replace me? How can I feel secure within my relationship with others? Everywhere I look I notice others better than me. People who are better looking taller smarter with nicer bodies and I cannot escape the realisation that these people could replace and take from me everything that I hold dear. I have an adoring girlfriend but how long will that last? How can I trust in permanence when so many better than me exist? When the wheels of fate are always in motion spinning towards a yet unknown destination? Every man man is my rival. Every man is better than me. I must be perfect otherwise I am worthless. Somewhere along the way during adolescence and early adulthood fear gripped my heart. It squeezed and twisted me into submission until I felt powerless to travel any road that was not certain and safe. In persuing safety I was tricked into embracing comfort which came for me in the from of constant daily drinking. For five years I drank and drank and isolated until I was emaciated malnourished alone so desperately alone wasted pitiful weak hopeless and broken. The indifference and apathy that was birthed by alcohol facilitied me leaving university abandoning the future I had dreamed of since a small boy and finally extinguishing the withering flame of hope that I did not know still existed inside of me.I slept on empty rum bottles littering a dirty and dark floor in a small room. I seldom washed or showered or ate and I only left the house to buy enough alcohol to fuel my twoletresaday rum habit. I was so alone so desperately alone. I spent over half a year without any communication with others at all and then only interacted with basic pleasantries in the couple of years that followed. Yet somehow against all predictions I stopped drinking. That was almost two years ago now. Since that moment I have not faltered once nor did I ever fear doing so. I was at rock bottom I knew that I could not drink anymore. The realisation hit me suddenly with force sufficient to stop me mid step on my way to buy rum. A voice in my head clear and confident and smooth stated you can't do this anymore and thus the decision to never drink again was made. And I cannot go against decisions already made in the same way I cannot reverse the motion that broke a glass against the floor. From that moment I have worked hard to build myself up from the creature I was. Now on the precipice of achieving two years of uninterrupted sobriety I have a new respectable fulltime job I workout five times a week I have a loving girlfriend and yet I am haunted by the immutable weight of my own inadequacies and regrets. Everyone around me is more successful than I am. My girlfriend is currently on a buisness trip abroad surrounded by other people of stature significance and importance. And what am I? An addict a university dropout and a worthless talentless static waste of life. I know that I cannot compare my life and success to others. Every person you meet has travelled a different path to yours with different privillages and struggles and a completely different set of potentials. I should only reflect on the life I have lived judging my success by the progress I have made. I understand this logically. It makes sense... Only I cannot help but compare. I want to be more. So much more. I need to be more. I want to go back to university but I fear I am not smart enough. I had no confidence in going in the first place but it was a path I was on so I did not dwell on the fear. Now with the flow of this path disrupted I cannot find within myself the confidence to take the plunge back into formal education. I am inert with doubt. Why is it I cannot move past my regrets? Why do I feel so inadequate?,Personality-disorder

51363,51610,AvPD doesnt mean that your brain is ill right? I was thinking that AvPD isnt caused by some brain illness. It is very possible that most people with AvPD have healthy brain right?I feel like AvPD is just that we learned things incorrectly we were exposed to some very stressful situations as child and our brains learned that that situation this is bad.And now our functioning brain is reminding us with anxiety that this situation is familiar from past when we were learning things. And this anxiety is causing us to avoid these situations because we were learnt that they are bad.So from this point we can say that our brain is normally functioning? Brain is doing what it is supposed to be doing trying to stay out of danger and survive.,Personality-disorder

51367,51615,Who else here is limerant? Just wanting to get an idea of the number of people who are limerant for unavailable people. For me it's always a man in a teaching or mentorship position who is married. Married because that means I'm safe. He's not going to act I'm not going to act. There isn't going to be a relationship. The attraction is just going to float in the air like a butterfly. Such intense but unattainable beauty. So much out of reach. I am in close almost daily contact with such a man. Its annoying me because I know its hopeless and could never go anywhere but I am addicted to it. Addicted to any little morsel of recognition he gives me. Addicted to making him laugh. It makes my day to make him laugh. He has no idea about the depth of my feelings because I am a person with AvPD and I know how to hide my emotions even lie about them and shut everything down. My brain is basically screaming 'stay safe stay safe.' I don't know who I am more annoyed with me or him. I think making him laugh is the way I make him comfortable with my attraction to him. Its like it must be pretty obvious I'm basically broadcasting 'I don't love you I'm just an awkward friendly doofus please like me.' It is intensely sad to me that this is the closest I will get to love. But even that is addictive. Sad beauty. Sad beauty is better than the grey anhedonia I am used to. I hope this makes sense. I hope someone understands or can relate.,Personality-disorder

51406,51665,An absence of social pleasure social anhedonia It is not possible to know what it is like to experience the world from inside someone elses body but I can infer from others that people enjoy being with other people more than I do. It is rare that I enjoy a persons company. Usually I look forward to being alone again. Instead of pleasure I do feel an absence of loneliness or fear but these are not pleasure. I very much experience health benefits from being with other people I cant deny this but in the moment I feel like something important is missing. To say it different I dont feel a desire to be with others unless I am wanting to soothe or avoid loneliness or fear. By default being alone is peaceful and ideal. Is it really anhedonia or is it also possible that my default is actually that the social anxiety overpowers the social pleasure so that I cant feel feel. And it takes a really strong negative emotion to overpower social anxiety in order to provoke a desire to be with others. Wish I understood so that I could participate more in life.,Personality-disorder

Still dont know if it could have been different for me Im bitter to say the least.Both times it was something like thisFirst year I try to fit in but get all stressed out. People reach out a little I either avoid it or get in the situation act awkward and get back to avoiding.Second year I get a nervous break down heavy paranoia and practically speak to nobody. People stop reaching out.Third year I feel a little better in a who cares anyway kind of way I try to act like a normal person again but people make an effort not to even come in contact with me.

51434,51696,How can I function with unwanted thoughts that don't go away? I am 22 years old and male. I was diagnosed when I was 18. I've also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I live with my parents and I am NEET. I did not go to college. I've spent the majority of my childhood and adolescence getting some kind of therapy andor psychiatric help but I stopped about a year ago because I realized it was not going to help me. I have very low energy and fleeting motivation and day to day I can't consistently do the basic tasks of caring for myself and maintaining my living space in other words living like an actual adult. The main reason these things are so hard for me is that when I'm doing chores and things where my mind can wander I keep thinking about things I don't want to think about. I remember in detail the moments when people have insulted me or been cruel to me or times when I've embarassed myself or made a mistake for years and I relive them constantly and the wounds are continuously reopened and never heal. I often freeze up when these thoughts strike me and sometimes it makes me curse or say things out loud when I know I'm alone. Sometimes these thoughts can be powerful enough to ruin a good mood and ruin my day. It can make completing simple tasks so painful that I avoid them entirely and my quality of life suffers greatly and it affects the people that I live with. I spend almost all of my time constantly trying to distract myself and escape from these thoughts. Can anyone relate? How can I function like this?,Personality-disorder

51451,51715,Is freezing during a conversation an AvPD symptom? Hi all! I'm new to this subreddit I was recently diagnosed with AvPD. I'm trying to understand it and come to terms with it.The thing is I don't have social anxiety in terms of not wanting to spend time with people at all... when it's about folks I know like my colleagues and friends I'm even morethanaverage social.However I do notice that I'm... slow in social interactions. I mean that someone will say something and my brain shuts down and I can't answer properly in the moment. Or I can't hear someone properly but I'm too afraid to ask them to repeat themselves ?! so I just kinda freeze andor act as if I heard what they said and the conversation goes on. Then later I think of a correct reaction and can't for my life understand why I shut down during the convo and couldn't just think of this reaction then.This happens with friends too although it's more common with folks I'm not that comfortable with. Is this an AvPD thing or just a me thing?TLDR Is shutting down during conversations and only thinking of a proper reaction later an AvPD thing?,Personality-disorder
51460,51724,Why is AVPD considered a personality disorder and not a mental illness? So from what i have read seems like AVPD is the only pure egodystonic personality disorder and usually personality disorders are seen as a flaw in someone's personality and are egosyntonic in nature but in the case of AVPD seems like no one likes to have this condition. So why isn't AVPD considered a mental illness because the symptoms of someone with AVPD seems to match up with different things like social anxiety and extreme low self esteem? Like the symptoms are basically the same in a lot of ways.,Personality-disorder

The pants used to fit me just fine but I've lost so much weight that I have to tie them around my waist or they'll just fall off.

I love how comfy clothes look my hair is long and messy and I guess I'm in a good enough state of mind to see myself as cute when my hair covers my face like it did. I am embarrassed that as a guy I like feeling cute but I think it's great and I've been told that it actually makes me more attractive. But when I was admiring myself in the mirror I lifted up my hoodie no I don't wear a shirt underneath my hoodies the temperature much too hot for that as I can barely wear this hoodie and I saw that my waist was super skinny. Of course I don't eat much and I still function fine so I guess that's okay. What I'm getting at is I was able to look at myself in the mirror today and I liked what I saw and people can think what they want I look exactly how I want to look today and I love that.Things have really been getting better for me and though there's still plenty of low points I can easily see my condition is getting better. I hope everyone else is doing okay and I hope that by sharing this I can bring some hope to anyone else who has been struggling with this pd. Thank y'all if you read this far and I hope you're doing well.,Personality-disorder
51524,51793,So tired of everything I am so goddamn tired of everything. I am not looking forward to anything have no goals..just a lowpaid job that I don't really like. I guess I can be proud that I got one in the first place despite how horribly painful that was to get used to it and my thoughts about quitting it after first week. But honestly other than that I have no clue why I am doing all this. I mean everything..going to job eating trying to do something..living. I am so tired I barely drag my body to work or practically anywhere. About my job..I got more or less used to it but I still feel like my coworkers hate me. It's my avpd brain acting up again. Goddamn pesky little thing. They're nice to me but this irrational part of me wins every time Every day is a misery and I am so tired.. I always tell myself that I have to go forward and don't stop but by now I am not sure why or where I am going. Feels like I am just aimlessly wandering around in the darkness with no clue whatsoever,Personality-disorder
51525,51794,Just wonder if people have heard of hypersensitivity. Im a Highly Sensitive Person or HSP but I realized I was being super sensitive for awhile now. I think this is when I started to realize my AvPD. I was talking to my former therapist a couple of months back and she told me about it. Her friend had become disabled and was being hypersensitive. I think a lot of this comes from trauma. Also doesnt help when people arent really compassionate in general. I dont really have much advice but try to heal from traumas. Ive been doing that alot more lately. It took a really long time but I feel less stuck now.,Personality-disorder
51536,51805,Just a quick moment of levity Hey guys what are your 3 favoritespecial films and 1 tv show you adoreMine areCherryDriveWind River...Mandy is also one of favs especially the first half of the film.And I'm a huge Stranger Things fan that's my favourite tv show,Personality-disorder
51540,51809,crippling guilt from my inability to answer texts I dont know how common this is but its extremely difficult for me to find the strength in me to text people back and its killing my nonexistent social life and the possibility of ever finding love. I live in constant guiltdread knowing that I have people in my DMs trying to contact me to hang out but my fear of embarrassment and awkwardness is freaking killing me. All ive ever wanted was to belong and be able to make friends but my brain literally stops me in my tracks. Its also necessary to note that I have ADHD primarily inattentive and once I take my medication Im lucky to have maybe 30min of adequate dopamine levels to push myself and reply. Sometimes I do reply but when I go back to baseline I just want to isolate and be in my dark room. I really feel like Im being tortured by my own brain. Its a terrible feeling to crave social interaction but to also be deathly afraid of the possibility that I could ruin everything and be viewed as an embarrassment. I really dont feel worthy of having the opportunity to make friends. My SSRIs have made me so numb and my personality rarely sparkles anymore so I cant imagine anyone would want to be around someone so dull.Do any of you relate?? It feels like a mental trap.,Personality-disorder
51547,51816,I dont know if I actually have AvPD Last few months I was struggeling with lots of depression. So I started looking on internet and I found lots of mental illnesses and I really felt like this one is really matching my symptoms.Now when I somehow improved my depression I see myself differently and I feel differently. I had depression my whole life without even realizing it for me having depression was a normal state sme I had no idea that there is a nondepression state.But now when my depression improved I see that some of AvPD symptoms starting disappearing and I feel better.But at this point I am just not sure I might have it and depression was making it worse. And I might now have it and it was just depression all the time.,Personality-disorder
51553,51822,Did not even want to say hi to me I have an online friend and they really wanted me to meet their friend. I was hesitant but they told me that theyre nice so I joined their little discord server literally had like 5 people total with me with the intentions of maybe sending a message or two and never again. But their friend didnt even want to say hi to me. Like my friend told him to say hi and he literally just said no . This happened a few days ago and Im like really upset about it. He barely even knows anything about me.I talked to my friend today and they said that they think he is just jealous that im sort of close with them. But Im still really really hurt and upset about. I feel like Im not even deserving of being acknowledged or spoken to.,Personality-disorder
27353,27373,November has been one of the worst months in a long time. My mom was in a car accident and has no idea how she's getting to work. A few days later my grandmother died and I didn't even have enough money to attend the funeral. I drove home to be with my family and to drive my mom 5 hours to the airport. I spent a ton on gas and now money is tight.,Stress
27453,27473,I'm a senior and I'm starting to go through the college application process and I just feel so overwhelmed. I haven't even finished my college list started ny essays or supplemental or filed my FAFSA. Not to mention I'm doing EA so I have a sooner deadline. I haven't visited any colleges and me ecs are so bad. God I just want this to be over with.,Stress
27488,27508,One of the couples has a fouryearold daughter. We live in a two bedroom apartment. I constantly have to do shit for these people. One of the wives scolds me constantly and tells me I need to show more respect for my parents. They leave needles out everywhere and when I inevitably step on one I'll probably end up with an STD.,Stress
27495,27515,and then proceeded to show me the video of the dumb girlfriend struggling to answer the question. Needless to say I was pissed. I said I couldn't believe he would think it was possible that I might be that stupid. He insisted that he only asked me as a joke and then I got angrier because in what world is questioning my ability to handle basic logic funny? He continued to go on the offensive insisting that he had been kidding that of course he doesn't think I'm stupid at all and how could I even think he would think that?,Stress
27546,27566,For no reason I'll just wake up with anxiety like feelings. Stomach ache uneasiness some sort of dread or feeling like any little thing would bring me over the edge and have a panic attack. I don't understand why and it can last for a long time. Anyways. Sometimes the breathing exercises help take the edge off it but it doesn't fully help.,Stress
27547,27567,All these sexual abuse accusations while wonderful to see so many men and women coming forward about sexual abuse I just can't escape it. So much victim blaming the increasingly clear proof that many men do not actually understand what consent means it's just too much. I haven't left the apartment in days and the only reliable form of self medication is too expensive weed. I'm also autistic so I've noticed it's also overstimulating me to the point I'm hiding. It's just too much and I thank you for reading my vent.,Stress
27593,27613,I can't stop the ruminating thoughts about the whole process. I also can't stop the what if's or I should have done more. I keep blaming myself and beating myself up. It sometimes makes me physically sick. Do you have any tips to help alleviate the pain and stop the thoughts?,Stress
27596,27616,Both of these were poor choices. It just exacerbated the situation. I had vases game controllers tv remote coffee mugs etc thrown at me on varied encounters. This is not an exaggerated list.. I tried to leave and she blocked the door with her body threatening to kill herself on one such occassion.,Stress
27602,27622,Most of 2017 I stayed at around 135 and have been really good about hiding my fat with very flattering clothes but over the last 3 months I have gained 15lbs as a result of traveling for work moving to a new city and the holidays. I have always been very unhappy with the way I look and I envy girls who are slim. I obsess about this in my head 247 and even though I try to stay positive the truth about how I REALLY feel comes out almost every time I go out drinking with friends and I become extremely negative and sometimes cry alone. My bf has told me that he is unhappy with my weight and he also hates seeing me unhappy. A summary of my bf he is a complete workaholic he loves me to death he tells me how beautiful I am every day he has dumped me 3 times because of my weight he thinks I am an excuse maker and he does not know if he will commit to me.,Stress
27633,27653,Does anyone have any advice? I feel pretty hopeless right now. I want desperately to be with my partner and I suspect even if our relationship ends I will always love and care for him very much. I don't want to spend my life wishing I was with him but be too overcome with my anxiety and fear to do so. It is discouraging to feel as though my exboyfriend is still inside my head and controlling my life.,Stress

27685,27705,The next couple of days have been mostly normal. A large group of my friends were visiting so I had a good time but that episode made me slightly anxious every now and then. I have no prior history of anxiety disorder or mental illness. For all I know this episode could have been anything or nothing but I do remember feeling a strong sense of anxiety during the tram ride. At the time I was attributing it to being a little paranoid on pot so I wasn't concerned until I started to lose my vision.,Stress
27697,27717,I was trying to eat my food but my hands became shaky and i then didnt feel hungry. People kept asking me why my hands are shaky and the people across from me laughing at me. Idk what to do ive worked here for 3 years but i just cant get over my anxiety. I just hate having meetings and celebrating with co workers. I havent been diagnose for anxiety disorder but i want to been on medication?,Stress
27700,27720,Kinda interesting how even when Im not feeling awful tiredness still makes me ruminate and feel angry. Hm. I wonder if its the biological sleepiness or if its kinda a pavlovian response because Im so used to having terrible feelings when I sleep? Probably kinda both. Anyway how are you all doing?,Stress
27702,27722,Extra Apparently he was jailed before marrying my mom and he never told us until she found out later into the marriage. There's more into the story but I would like to know if I can file a charge on him for past incidents as well.... and I am upset that he is going to be charged for misdeamenor instead of felony. Since the victim my mom has enough evidences it will be hard for him to drop the charges right? He has been avoiding the police so it took a while for the police to catch him but he paid for the bail and bailed himself out with a help of his friend. I just wished he would recieve a felony but he pleaded not guilty on the first court appearance and apparently there are more court appearances to be made befoe verdict is finalized....,Stress
27716,27736,He wouldn't take me to the hospital but I could feel the gaping wound in the back of my head and the hole in my lip my tooth had done. He kept packing. So I called the police. I couldn't see out of my left eye and clearly couldn't drive and felt I had no other option. The police department chose not to press charges.,Stress
27735,27755,This is marriage 2 for both of us. Husband's 52 M ex 51 F cheated my ex 53 M had emotional affair leading to ending marriages in the same year. We dated in high school and reconnected as friends started dating about a year later moved in together after a year got engaged 2 years after that. Before getting engaged I found out he was having an emotional affair with a woman who lived about a 5 hour drive away from us. I found out when he left an IM open on his computer found steamy texts when I went to shut off a noisy program.,Stress
27748,27768,I'm in my third year at uni and starting my diss now its due in January and I'm really struggling with feelings of dread and anxiety.

27749,27769,Do I just need to forget about the dumb girlfriend incident and stop assuming that he thinks I'm stupid? And how do I do that? Help! tldr Because of an unfortunate incident earlier in our relationship I sometimes have a hard time believing that my boyfriend thinks I'm smart. How do we navigate this?,Stress
27754,27774,I feel sad for you I feel sad for me. I pray that you will get the help you so desperately need so that nobody else has to endure the terror and horrible horrible physical sexual and emotional abuse you have put me through. I am riding myself of all my shame associated with what has happened. I know now it was all you. I did not do anything wrong to deserve the horrible treatment I received from you.,Stress
27764,27784,I have a very hard time with trying to find a job from most places I don't get any feedbacks but get immediate rejection when I try to apply to other open positions at the same company. Interestingly there's a lot of propaganda around how there's a shortage on manpower while at the same time people having difficulty finding jobs. There are notable instances of similar experiences political opponents' family members getting fired for no reason etc. My father did a big disservice to the local Fidesz by being a key figure against the prison project which was going to be built by a company very well known for overpriced projects my grandfather is a well known tankie who's so racist he's often accidentally agrees with both Fidesz and Jobbik not to mention I had a lot of bullies in secondary school who thought I was severely mentally disabled long story short I had some speech issues I've since overcome for the most part but thanks to the Hungarian Rword I got some serious shit such as being accused with my mother taking up huge benefit money which she spends on shoes and jewelry which leads them having to pay a lot of taxes on their motorcycles game consoles phones etc and probably wanted to take their revenge this way which is ironic because the hard time I had financially radicalized me from an actual centrist to a radical leftist. My father is seriously thinking on kicking me out to the streets if I won't pay which makes me to go back to my mother and my abusive stepfather who cannot accept my autistic quirks implying if I can go back to them and my stepfather will let it all go through.,Stress
27778,27798,I think this is a good conversation to have in person but I likely won't see him for months. Would it be tackywildly unromantic to do this over textemail? Additionally I don't want to ruin things between us or make things weird and I'm not sure how to broach the subject. How do I not screw this up? ,Stress
27781,27801,He has even made a comment to my bf about me being overweight. Being overweight has basically taken over my relationship my mind and my life. This year I am making it a priority to lose the weight especially since I have nothing else occupying my mind like cancer. My confidence level right now is 0 and I feel so fucking ugly and fat. If I just got in shape I know that I would be close to a 10.,Stress
27822,27842,I love her too but I am super paranoid about the whole deal. Current situation We both confessed that we love each other but I wont be going back to my home country for another 6 months. Because of my past toxic relationship I fear things will change between us well get into fightshave trust issues etc. Problem Should I get into a LDR with her or we should continue being best friends which would be hard because she has already very clearly confessed she loves me problems are 1.,Stress
27831,27851,So I've basically got a plan hoard all my drugs until Tuesday OD that night with a combo of slit wrists and maybe even hanging. I want it to be damn efficient because this is trial number 13. These are the thoughts I've been having lately. My last attempt was at a hospital just a few days ago but I lied and told them it was my anxiety that led me to selfharm. They discharged me.,Stress
27837,27857,I used to take sleeping pills that had a bit of anti anxiety medicine in them but my pcp drug tested me and because I had been found to have been smoking weed for my ptsd it was either stop coming their for the sleeping pills or weed. I chose weed mostly because I was pissed they drug tested me for one but also weed seems to do the best for me. Now im regretting that decision. I guess I need a new pcp huh? Anyway its a reddit until I dont feel like a deer in headlights kind of night so whoopee.,Stress
27849,27869,I know that I can't be unemployed forever but I'm just too anxious to really do anything. And everyone in my family keeps asking what my plan is and I keep lying because saying I've got nothing is just too humiliating. I'm just stuck. Have any of you gone through something similar and have any advice? I appreciate it.,Stress
27855,27875,The following week my mom let me use her car to drive my brother to another city for an appointment. The car is going to be mine when she buys herself a new one so I was really excited about driving it around more often. Everything was fine until I got to the actual city and then a woman drove through a red light and hit my mom's car. I held myself together because my younger brother was with me and he has his own depression to deal with he didn't need to see his sister break down. The car was still driveable so I dropped him off and his appointment and then had my meltdown in the drivers seat while explaining everything to my mom.,Stress
27862,27882,I have trouble connecting to it on a personal level but isn't that healthy separation of pastpresent? I think my present anxietiesself image issues stem from traumatic experiences but I can talk about these things fairly openly in a way that feels rehearsed. I had a panic attack where I felt terrified and unable to move at my psych's this past Tuesday but that's not typical for me at least not anymore? I realized most my recent panic attacks may be breakdowns because it's not accompanied by a sense of fear but pent up emotions I haven't been able to release resulting in a sudden loss of control... I start hyperventilating screaming and unleash all this pent up fury to the point where I feel detached from my emotionsself and have no control start throwing things or hurting myself until I'm exhausted and suddenly shut downdissociate.,Stress
27932,27952,When people Don't understand and tell you how to be when you evade all answers and feel like a monstrosity Shut the blinds the outside world hide away worry about the morning upcoming day Night arrives should be fine am I right turns into a turbulent anxiety night shake my head am I the only one who feels this way Take my meds daily occurrence of will this ever end hate this paranoia of internal mindset Get told it will get better how to be change myself for you to try and frankly that's never the good answer,Stress
27938,27958,I am so scared to go up to 10mg because I want to still be able to lose weight. My doc has suggested Prozac because it has had more success with weight loss than weight gain with majority of people. I just don't know what I want to do. I thought I was going to be able to get off meds but these physical symptoms which set off my hypocondria are coming back in full swing. Even though I KNOW it's anxiety I can't break the loop of thoughts.,Stress
27945,27965,I saw a professional for a psych evaluation and though there are no flashbacks or nightmares I still am placed with the ptsd label. I know this isnt something you just get over I just thought I moved on from my trauma I watched a few episodes of bojack horseman and its thrown me into an episode of depression Idk Im sad Im mad I get irritable I have no idea what symptoms and triggers are for me I just keep going because if I dont Ill stop and fall apart. Im like a piece of glass being held together by masking tape. I wouldve rather been told Im a sociopathpsychopath or a narcissist due to my severe apathy towards everything.,Stress
27952,27972,how is it possible that he can drive and use his fist to punch you? did you do something wrong?. The only thing I got from the police was a worn out looking card to the social work department and by the way they offer counselling nothing else. To this day they have not arrested him because apparently the attack occurred in the middle of two districts apparently it's really hard to determine which district is responsible and because of bureaucratic issues the man has not been taken to questioning. My mother helped me tremendously by arranging the divorce for me and in the divorce we did not put any alimony.,Stress
27960,27980,Even though we did break up I don't know if he's taking it seriously and if he just thinks I'll come home and we'll be ok. I'm so tired of being treated like shit by everyone in my life. I'm not strong enough to take care of myself to fight back to leave. And I can't work I can't even answer phone calls because of my anxiety how am I supposed to survive? My family doesn't understand my mental issues so I can't get help from them with it they tell me I need to start looking for a job and I can't even say anything.,Stress
27973,27993,Why did I have to scream in pain? Sometimes the bashings would be so bad that I would call my mum while she was at work sometimes my brother and I would be home alone after I returned from school when he would torment and bash me. I would run into my room and lean against the bedroom door with all my weight while my brother kicked and punched through it from the other side. Once the wood splintered and went into my back. Still noone stopped him.,Stress
28006,28026,For example I'm selling something that's worth 50? You can have it for 10. I hate it I want to cry. I've had items listed for about 2 weeks they're all responsibly priced or under and I'm having to accept low ball offers as I have no other choice. I would never let myself in a million years do this if I wasn't homeless but the clock is ticking and I need to move.,Stress
28036,28056,So I survived years of physical and sexual abuse as a kid. I'm finally at the place in my counselling where my therapist and I both think I'm ready to work through it. I really like her and trust her but the guided questions she asks remind me of how few specific details I actually remember. Today she had me close my eyes to focus on where in my body I was feeling my anger and it was like I was whooshing through a tunnel until she wasn't in the room anymore and my body felt all weird and flat my head would feel gigantic and then absolutely minuscule my hands would be gigantic and then my feet.....I don't know how to explain it. It's like that scene in Inside Out where the characters become abstract shapes for awhile?,Stress
28043,28063,I spent the next few years being extremely reckless and impulsive. My home life was never easy I had an odd relationship with most of my relatives except my mom who was probably the only reason why I am even stable to this day. My brother was always seen as the golden child and me as the problem child so I was constantly shamed by extended family for being so impulsive and reckless which we all know is common signs of PTSD in adolescents. I think my mom was ashamed of my initial assault and though I was able to get help I was never allowed to tell anyone about it and a lot of my extended family I didn't even tell until the last couple of years so this has left a strange dynamic for me of not knowing how I feel about telling people my story but also desperately wanting to share it. In 2011 I finally met my husband who is the only reason I'm even doing as successful as I am today.,Stress
28047,28067,I've never even told anyone this because it makes me feel like a 32yearold loser. But now I have no pride to lose by saying it so there it is. I don't want to die but the thought of living in a place I hate and having no control of my future is a worse fate. I just need some HOPE. Thanks for listening.,Stress
28064,28084,There's nothing I can say or do that will alleviate her worries. In the past I've tried to solve things but that doesn't help. I've tried just listening and agreeing or offering comments like that does sound bad or I understand but those don't seem to help either. Does anyone have advice on what I can do or say to not cause anger or start a fight? I'm at a loss as to what I need to do or be for her.,Stress
28072,28092,Wtf. I did this to myself. I knew I needed to study and I just kept putting it off and putting it off. I knew I didnt do well but I didnt think I bombed it so fucking hard. Im going to have to lie to everyone about it.,Stress
28093,28113,I wondered if anyone else had a similar place that they always found themselves in. I can't decide if it's healthy or not since most of the traumatic things that happened at home were in that space. I'll find myself camped out sobbing on the floor but can't really pinpoint why it's the place I always seek out. Secondly if it's not helping me recover how can I make the rest of my house more appealing? I'm not consciously choosing to end up in the kitchen it's just where I go.,Stress
28131,28151,Friends and loved ones who don't have anxiety keep telling me to relax and since it's such a busy place it's nothing personal and to not think it worry about it. Which I'm sure is 100 true but not matter how many times it's said anxiety never believes it. I start my next shift in 30 minutes and stating to freak out and have small panic attacks which haven't happened in a while. I've been so good about keeping my anxiety in control and not putting myself in anxious situations and this job pushed that being the public eye and fucking up is one my biggest triggers but the pay and reputation of the company is widely known and it's one of the most wanted jobs in my town. Does anyone have any advice or maybe gone thru something similar and came out on top?,Stress
28162,28182,And Im scared all the time. I get flashbacks from ptsd at home and now my home is full of these spider and insect memories. And I feel like so few people in my life can really handle this and thats even more isolating. Im sorry. I needed a place to put this down and try and stop crying.,Stress
28171,28191,Also there was an attempted rape on me when I was 21. I never realised how much an effect these events had on me. There is another woman that I like F32. She is very intelligent and we talk all the time. The problem is that I am married even though my marriage is awful.,Stress
28182,28202,It seemed like there was no recognition of my emotional state and like he just wanted me to be quiet. That scares me. He claims he was trying to help comfort me but I really am having trouble believing that. This is the second time something like this has happened. The first time was when we were arguing and it was getting really heated.,Stress
28205,28225,My boyfriend is currently stationed overseas while Im still in the states with my four year old and our seven month old. It has been very hard for both of us but I at least have the kids. I often feel guilty for feeling sad or lonely because he doesnt have anyone there. No friends yet family and he misses our son terribly. Hes having a really rough time with missing all of the milestones of babies first year and is depressed often... when hes sad he gets angry.,Stress
28221,28241,But it hit close to home when my own parents have pressured me over the years to reconcile with my brother angrily demanding how I'd handle their funerals whether I'd insist on not going I wouldn't. My brother was best man for our other brother's wedding which I attended but declined being a bridesmaid and kept a careful distance. Then I went home drank an entire bottle of wine and cried while my husband comforted me. 2. I never would have known about my cousin's son if I hadn't been able to make the funeral yesterday.,Stress
28303,28323,I keep getting sudden very short panic attacks. Or anxiety attacks. I'm not sure if I feel fear I don't even know what the feeling is because I forget everything short term afterwards. They last a presumably short amount time and is the worst feeling imaginable to me. Some random thought I can never remember triggers it it's definitely something that repeats though it's a familiar feeling afterwards.,Stress
28315,28335,I wanted to plant a new chapter in my new city but haven't had time to devote to making it happen yet. I feel like I was the only one taking it seriously and it's dying a slow death. My problem is that one of the acquaintances is giving me a lot of power playtype problems. For example I'll request four times in three different mediums we use to email contributions to an endofyear favorites list and rather than do that she put hers on a share drive and told others to do the same in spite of my multiple requests to email me instead for better ease of sharing. Emails are met with snarky responses or halfmeasures which mean I still have to chase down.,Stress
28321,28341,I feel like at this point I'm the only one putting effort into our relationship. I've suggested taking time to ourselves so that he could think things through taking a break talking about it meeting up we really only can see each other on the weekends due to classes etc. Still the short responses. He's started to not respond to me we talk through an app that shows when the other has read the message. I know his class schedule so I know when we can answer back he checks his phone often.,Stress
28322,28342,Usually after each session I get a headache also. I can't tell if i'm becoming worse because I did EMDR on my bad drug experiences and feel great now. The rest of what i'm dealing with is early childhood trauma which was prolonged so i'm thinking EMDR is just bringing out these feelings and making my body become very unhappy since im reprogramming it to not constantly be hyper aware and anxious. Ive had a few hospital visits because after some sessions i turn into a hypochondriac because the physical responses are so odd. One session made the left side of my face numb.,Stress
28348,28368,My question how do I heal from this? As much as I wish there were a way to go back and fix my relationship with her she deserves to heal from the damage I've done and I have no right to ask for anything and so I won't. Lessons I've taken away I will NEVER do anything like this again. Too much pain for someone you love and it's very hard to reconcile internally.,Stress
28364,28384,WARNING Messy post I'm really all over the place sorry guys. I have a lot on my mind. Hope you can make the best of this text. Also sorry for any spelling errors english isn't one of my talents. Me and my boyfriend has been dating for over a year now.,Stress
28382,28402,So I've been taking Zoloft for several months and it has been working well for anxietydepression but I'm having some problems with it. The biggest problem is that my mind feels blank a majority of the time. When conversing with other people sometimes I feel as if I have nothing to say. I feel as if I am less witty and also less creative. I've backed down my dosage from 100mg to 50mg with some success as I don't feel as 'spaced out'.,Stress
28399,28419,I can't be having PTSD from something as mild as what happened even though I have pretty much all the symptoms. I feel I'm just lying to myself. I probably just want attention. I feel like a huge fraud... How am I even supposed to heal when I'm probably making everything up I'm probably not broken I'm just going to get yelled at again at the new therapy place like my last one because I'll be mute every session don't even know why I tell myself because I'm not ready to talk about it but it's been over 5 years since the last case and all this crap is minor so it's probably just being ashamed over doing all this crap for godknowswhy when barely anything happened to me... because I'm not trying. I don't even know why I'm posting this probably just begging for more attention I've pushed the last true friend I had away a few days ago over my fears of therapy.,Stress
28401,28421,I'm not against working my ass off I'm just getting down right now no responses to applications can do that. I'm in a state that doesn't even have a real art school. I have no funds whatsoever no family to help I don't know where to go from here? Like how do you even apply for scholarships? How do I not starve to death if I can get to art school?,Stress
28472,28492,He has done it to lots of people and says every night that he is going to kill himself but then never does anything. Not even self harm. This also affects my family life as I come home everyday feeling stressed and this causes conflict in my family. I still live with my mum and she works hard and travels a lot so she is also stressed so I try to bottle it in to not give her more stress but then it eventually comes out in the form of arguments because we both try to bottle in our emotions so we end up falling out and both feeling very upset. Please can someone help me find a way to cope with all of this it would mean a lot to me.,Stress
28475,28495,I dont know what to expect. I just want to not be so alone. He is a law enforcement officer in this small town. Ive been down this road with him before. The injuries have never been so severe though.,Stress
28505,28525,But I mean does it really matter? I didn't know that either but I still felt the same. And he was well aware of what I was going through as much as he could have. Also that whole living situation and that man was horrible and stressful anyway without it being a trigger for something else too. And I know that if I had been in his position I would have done everything I could to help my partner and taken them seriously regardless of whether I would have felt that way or as bad about something or not.,Stress
28541,28561,I live in a different country than where I'm from and I feel like all my actual friends are back home and that I have very few good friends in this country that I can talk to and who want to spend time with me. I just suddenly don't really know what to do with myself or what I want. Like I'm kinda stuck and going nowhere and I hate feeling so insignificant. I don't know maybe I'm making a big deal for nothing and my anxiety is getting to me. I have CBT tomorrow so I know I'll have a chance to talk about it there but I just feel so hopeless today and didn't know where else to turn but to reddit.,Stress
28555,28575,I think it was last year we could hear the little girl crying out so loud inside their home we called the cops. This is just a rumor but our nextdoor neighbors say that the house is actually under police watch and that they're drug dealers. The dad is some heavily obese man who should probably invest in larger shirts and he doesn't leave the home. There are always cars coming and going from the house sometimes the same cars other times cars we've never seen before. Ya know to buy drugs and shit.,Stress
28558,28578,I want something that would help with a small does of social anxiety and also prevent any future panic attacks anyone have any good experience with other SSRI's ? tldr.. Been on Lexapro for panic attacks and social anxiety for 6 months. Got all the bad side effects of Lexapro and it made me have a few moments of almost going insane. I haven't had panic attacks since and my anxiety is maybe slightly better but it's not worth the cons. Anyone have stories of switching off Lexapro to something else that made them less anxious and more confident?,Stress
28578,28598,Last few weeks Ive overcome some serious issues and I was traveling most the time and it helped me a lot. But now that Im home Im falling back to my old self Im isolating myself in my house. I barely go out again I cant even manage to get myself a haircut and I dont want fall back in this hole again. I picked myself up and going falling back can someone help me.,Stress
28580,28600,I emailed him a few times and received no response from him when I really needed one. Because of his lack of response I was forced to drop out of school University of State Go Mascots!! and I could not finish the quarter and now owe them much more money than before. But it is NOT entirely his fault. Yes I resent him at times but I could have just as easily approached him about the subject and gotten everything taken care of but my anxiety hadn't made me comfortable around them so I couldn't bring my self to do it.,Stress
28598,28618,I am frantically trying to figure out what distractions I can rely on during downtime. The group I will be with are ecstatic about the cruise and have no issue with sitting in a recliner and doing nothing. I however don't want to be alone with my thoughts. I plan on bringing books audio books podcasts and whatever videos I can cram on my devices but reading or listening to something during an activity or around the group will probably be seen as rude or antisocial. The wifi on the ship is supposedly terrible and expensive so I can't even casually browse reddit which is normally my goto distraction.,Stress
28626,28646,It would seem getting this out there would be a huge turn off for her it certainly is for me so why is she acting that way? Again I don't tell her this but it's almost as if she's trying to account for infidelity except she wasn't...she was abused. I'm just trying to solve this in my head. My emotions are a wreck. I'll definetely reach out to a therapist soon but could use help in the meantime.,Stress
28664,28684,I don't know why because it didn't bother me before I actually saw it on a screen but I am absolutely crushed. I've asked him to hide it from me from now on and expressed how hurt it was but I went to use his gaming system a couple of days ago and saw he was still looking it up regularly I guess he thought I wouldn't use it I had gone to look up something and all the searches popped up in the Bing bar. I never felt attractive to him and I know that's my own fault and insecurity and not his problem to fix. I know rationally that men like variety. But I haven't sent him nudes in probably two months now.,Stress
28680,28700,I paid off some of my credit card debt a couple days ago but my company also charged me on their automatic pay system. I barely had enough this paycheck to cover just the single payment when this extra payment processes it's going to cost me an overdraft fee. I am in no position to let that happen and so I need money to cover for it as well as cover for my student loan payment which also hasn't processed yet. I need somewhere around 50 to completely clear me out of any sort of financial trouble. I can use Paypal or Google Wallet whichever works best.,Stress
28682,28702,I was completely on my own by 14. When she felt the cuts on my wrists in the dark on night she asked if I was cutting ? I said no and she never said anything again. I could go on and on. I think she truly believes that because I am an adult now that all the screw ups all the pain I have been through is my own fault.,Stress
28688,28708,I'm afraid that maybe they aren't true and I'm demonizing him in my memory because having a villain that did horrible things to me is just easier to digest than the complicated truth. The worst thing is I can't bring myself to talk to anybody. I always felt like I wasn't bad enough to need a doctor. I felt like I could get through it on my own. Even now its hard for me to open up to my fiance about these things.,Stress
28705,28725,She also told me that I was an idiot for wasting my life or attempting to end it anyways. I came out of that appointment in tears. That was a horrible day and I still think about it. It made me feel like I had nothing to complain about. Its only taken me until the last couple of weeks to finally accept that I did nothing wrong.,Stress
28721,28741,Background This time last year I lost my job got evicted and my car broke down all in the same month. Cut to today and I found out my site is closing and we'll all soon be out of the job. I just feel like a big ball of anxiety and like I can't quite turn my brain off. It's like the world beneath my feet is off and I'm doing everything I can not to cry. Sorry for the brick of text.,Stress
28740,28760,That was easy I was probably anxious about my health because I lost a very close relative when I was 11. The second step was to identify when my health anxiety episodes were taken place. Checking my records of doctor visits I could see that my health anxiety manifests after a stressful period in my personal or working life. The stressful period would cause some psychosomatic symptoms and would trigger my health anxiety. Another trigger would be something I heard about someone dying or getting sick or reading about a rare illness.,Stress
28787,28807,I have no one to relate with and if I can't get around it I'll be eventually separated because I can't afford to fail another PFT because of it. I'm not here for sympathy about what lead to my anxiety. I want to put that out there. And I'm not sorry if anyone gets offended by my dark sense of humor. That's the only way I've found temporarily deal with it.,Stress
28794,28814,I'm exhausted from just continuing to go to work. God I'm so tired... I know I'm so much further than I was a year ago. But it still sucks. But I know I'm getting happier I am happy most days.,Stress
28811,28831,Some times it feels like my dreams will never go away. I have regular dreams about my ex. Usually a few dreams every week. Sometimes the dreams quiet down and some times they occur every night. He was abusive to the point where he tried to kill me while I was laying in bed one night and he was very physically abuse every other day.,Stress
28818,28838,When we are at work we joke around but we all do that. I feel so ashamed. I want to hear your opinion on the fact am i to blame? Was it my fault because something like this happened? tldr Something delicate happened between me and my collegue,Stress
28819,28839,Original post here url Quick update my abusive ex who put forward his candidacy for local council was elected Friday by acclamation meaning no one came forward to challenge him so no election will be necessary and he is automatically the winner. He is flush with victory at the moment. I have decided to come forward anyways about the emotional and sexual abuse that I experienced during the relationship. I know I may pay a price for speaking openly in our small community.,Stress
28864,28884,I was physically and sexually abused by my mom as a kid. She would pull my pants down and fondle my genitals from the time I was a child up until I moved out for college. This is something where I know it happened and I can remember time after time how it had happened. About a month ago though I had a really vivid and visceral nightmare about a form of sexual abuse that I can't place in a timeline like I can with the other types of abuse. In this nightmare my mom and I are naked in bed and she is touching me until I get so scared that I push her away and fall out of the bed.,Stress
28885,28905,Every rational part of me believes I'm retroactively terrified of the fact I almost didn't get to live the life I'm living now. I wish I wouldn't think about it. But I just keep doing it. It's like I get some sick thrill out of the fear and anxiety like it's a horror movie or rollercoaster. I know I shouldn't be feeling that way about it but I am and I don't know why or how to stop it.,Stress
28892,28912,I tried some cheese and some had pretty intense flavors and being an highly sensitive person this i think caused some stress. We stood for about an hour when i felt this dropping feeling in my stomach. I knew this was a sign to get some food and sit down but my dad was very happy checking out cheeses so i risked just waiting and chilling out. Then my whole body felt that dropping sensation and my hearing started going. I started getting warm and it felt like pin needles on my body.,Stress
28901,28921,Hi everyone and thank you in advance for reading. I moved my family from Texas to Colorado thinking I had a new job lined up on the other side this job fell through. Fortunately I have a new job starting January 23rd but I don't have enough in savings to carry me through. We are running very low on necessities like bread and milk.

28984,29004,I fucking wish I could talk this out with family therapies and interventions god knows i've tried. My existence here is predestined and i'm going to become whoever and whatever my family wants me to be dealing with whatever they through my way. I wish my mother could love me. It's either this plan or suicide as blunt and intense as that sounds. I plan on deleting this out of paranoia soon but will keep the responses.,Stress
29031,29051,That being said I feel like every idea I have to contribute gets shot down. It doesn't help that I'm not the best at communicating ideas. I feel like I'm at a dead end and am not being considered to move up because of it. It's gotten me so anxious that I don't know what to do except look for other opportunities. I feel like he's just pretending to appreciate what I do.,Stress

I still think I love him but I find myself thinking about other people more and part of myself wants to see if I can do better. We get along great but Ive always felt that our relationship has lacked an emotional aspect on his part. Part of the reason I want to end it also has to do with our financial situation were both broke but I want to start working more to save more money because Im trying to be more financially independent. I feel like he is somehow holding me back from my personal goals.,Stress
29091,29111,Yo straight up. I am so goddamn sick of it. Yeah its fine I will wake tomorrow and do the work moving forward but life is honestly the most pointless bullshit ever. Tomorrow my social worker comes. I just got rejected for a program I was kind of counting on.,Stress

Im planning on going back to school in Houston since UH is about 8500 a year for instate tuition which I can convince myself I can afford. Im just so sad and disappointed. This was never how my life was supposed to be but when your mom who's financially irresponsible lightly put and lets you go to a school that is 150K without even knowing it I was basically doomed from the start and this is now my reality. Maybe Ill just kill myself before then so I don't have to face this life because this has become too much to handle.,Stress
29142,29162,Because not really. I would have survived I always have before I have gone three and four days without eating a single thing on dozens of occasions in the last fifteen years and I will be fine.

I got pregnant again after he forcibly took my birth control away my 2nd son was born in Chile I didn't realize once I had my child in Chile I couldn't leave with my son without the father's permission.

My nose broke so even if i didn't want to make a charge the police automatically makes a charge since it's agravated assault since a bone broke this is the law here. I don't really want to talk much about it because it triggers me. So one day my phone rings and a police officer called me that i need to go to the police station to a so called confrontation.

29374,29394,Ive been in an abusive relationship for 3 years now. My family had stopped talking to me and live states away when my boyfriend and I got together. The first time I noticed abuse was when he wanted to repeatedly have sex till I was sore and would get angry if I refused. It was subtle at first but it scared me. As time went on I would here everyday how I was too skinny I need to gain some weight.. it got to the point to where I would ask questions about why I wasnt good enough and was depressed ... he would throw a speaker in a room along with me and put stuff in front of the door to where I couldnt get out.,Stress

29413,29433,Three months of this and talking with the one friend whom I could call for free between 9pm and 6AM due to ATT's GoPhone policies whenever I could get away with it or texting on a Nokia Tracphone the ancient indestructible brick phone and my sister lashing out at me about being ungrateful that they allowed me to come over and use the internet triggered by my snapping back due to something I can't remember and I just stopped asking. Ended up losing contact with everyone but the one friend I could talk to maybe once or twice a week for a couple hours. She'd try to keep me apprised of stuff going on with folks and those phonecalls ended up bring the spark that bloomed into us being a couple but... It wasn't enough. The same negativity the same feelings of selfhatred of selfdisgust of believing everything my father had dumped on me slowly took over.,Stress
29448,29468,Which forced me to acknowledge that I havent been performing to my own expectations. Enter the anxiety attack. Sobbing shaking fidgeting and rambling.

29488,29508,We've talked about it before and she said that it's not like that and she cares about me alot and all that but at the same time these type of things keep happening. I truly feel that she does care and doesn't mean to neglect me but its just frustrating. If I keep saying something I'll look like a bad guy thats trying to ruin her friendships which is not what i'm trying to do. She's going to tell her friends what I say and they're probably going to think i'm trying to get her away from them. tldr Girlfriend is having trouble balancing friendship and relationship,Stress
29495,29515,But how do I keep going with this girl and eventually ask her to hang out again because no romantic relationship can really progress forward until we're physically intimate with each other but we can't get there unless we hang out. And she doesn't even like talking on the phone and just texts. I feel like I'm having a relationship with my phone sometimes and it's like a female Wilson sometimes lol movie Castaway reference for those who don't know. Anyone who has been in an abusive relationship and came out of it or anyone who dated an abused survivor how do you advise that I progress things with her? TLDR I'm dating a girl who was formerly in an abusive relationship.,Stress

29544,29564,I used my forearm to push the plate I was eating from off the counter. A glass bowl fell to the floor as well and shattered. The noise woke my dad up who went to bed nearly black out drunk a couple hours before this. He immediately started screaming at my friends to get the fuck out and aggressively pushing them out of the back door. He then grabbed me by my arm and shoved me out the door yelling take her fucking ass with you. My friends sat with me for a minute and asked if I wanted to leave with them.,Stress
29553,29573,I know its terrible and selfish and obviously people can be friends with each other but I just miss having a really strong and healthy friendship with another girl the way that we did. I want to have a good weekend but it feels impossible now and I want everyone there to have a good weekend and I dont want to make it bad. I dont know what to do. So I just feel like crawling into my little isolation hole and being sad by myself while knowing that everyone hates me... to be honest I dont know why Im overthinking it cause honestly no one would care if I did isolate myself. Its just I want to be better not just for other people but for myself too.,Stress
29578,29598,I'm afraid of going into too much detail only because I constantly fear that he knows that I talk about him. To keep it short my father was physically violent towards me my mother our dog mistreated all of his animals leaked our information on shady sites before multiple times and has made my life a living hell up until I went to court to stop having visitation with him. I almost died twice thanks to him. I thought that it wouldn't really affect anything outside of startle reflex trust issues etc but here I am years after my last visit with him and it's still affecting me fucking terribly. I just sat in bed sobbing for a half hour because I'm afraid of everyone around me.,Stress
29591,29611,And they all make it sound like I will have infinity free time and money to go exploring all over where I'm going like I'm going on a damn vacation. I'll still be spending all my free time job hunting. If they want me to come right back to a shithole that doesn't want to hire me because I'm supposedly overqualified just by existing I keep getting rejections telling me I'm overqualified except for the one that asked me to fill out yet another application despite me handing them one two weeks ago maybe they can pay my way and then they can pay for all the months that I don't have income. I have come back here too many times already to nothing and they seem to think I'm just hanging around having fun living in my car. Unbelievable.,Stress
29600,29620,However today I was sitting at work and for whatever reason I started thinking about the knife incident.

The degree that I have was more theory based and I really need hands on experience to be employable in my field which I now have the opportunity to do alongside guaranteed internships and portfolio work. My stress levels are currently through the roof about this as I am worried that I won't be able to match the calibre of current high school leavers who even though treated as adults at University still seem to have that high school mentality. My main issue is even though not permanent the dorm style accommodation and the fact that an old person is living with basically a teenager although I did apply for a single room with a shared bathroom so maybe not so bad. Usually I wouldn't have a problem with this but already having experienced this with not much success I am now stressing immensely. I'm not there to be anybody's friend but the way I have been treated in the past just for being a little older has been disgusting. There is not much available accommodation at all in the country so looking for anything else is currently out.Honestly I think I'm just stressing because I'm over 30 and feel like I still don't have my life in order with another future gap in my resume.

48426,48414,I ask you from the bottom of my heart to help me....... P.s The whole essence of the problem is in the second paragraph the first paragraph is about me I am 18 years old I have a weak nervous system from birth but a strong character and because of three years of serious problems in life the death of several close people my nervous system has failed and I probably have chronic anxiety.From below I will describe everything that I have tried if you have something to say I beg on my knees help me I tried meditation for 40 minutes a day breathing techniques and much more of this type but I came to the conclusion that this is not a solution to the problem but a group control of my mind I have tried a very large number of different herbs ashwagandha sacred basil.Also different supplements taking longer than 1 month and zero results at most it became a little easier but it is almost imperceptible.Personally I think that these herbs supplements are mostly utter nonsense which has a lot of side effects stupid studies that were not conducted in real life or just made to promote the product I tried using reishi mushroom cbd oil from a proven brand tried vaping and other ways of using and everything is even Please do not recommend medications or any herbs of the kava type which has a hundred side effects it is better to die than to eat this shit.If you really know a magic supplement herb or something else about which few people know and it HELPED YOU OR YOUR FRIEND ACQUAINTANCE tell it to me please please please please please please please pleaseDo not think that I am the type of people who have tried 1 product and immediately gave up I am a person who ALWAYS GOES TO the END and will never accept defeat.I really spent a hundred hours analyzing this topic for the most part and 99 of all the information is just a stinky slag bitch and it's impossible to fucking find adequate information.I searched in YouTube in different languages also in Google itself for different queries in different languages on Twitter and Facebook and found nothing working.If you have read this minipost thank you so much for at least thinking about the possible help to a stranger.All the best to you!!!!!!!,Stress
48431,48419,I systematically throw up before having a Zoom meeting with my soontobe PHD supervisor Before anyone asks no the problem is not coming from my supervisor. Hes kind willing to help and available for me. If you ask me I wouldnt even say that I feel stressed before the meetings in the sense that Im not overthinking Im not having this bowl of stress in my belly that one could have facing pressure. Yet I dont know why systematically 105 minutes before the meeting I go to the toilet and I throw up everything I have even if I had a light breakfast before. I really dont know what can I do to stop this because it doesnt feel like the problem is coming from me. It feels like I have no other choice but to throw up. Obviously its linked to the fact that Im going to apply to a PhD and the fact that hes a very knowledgeable man in his field and theres probably a bit of impostor syndrome playing. But whats worrying me is the fact that of all the 1012 meetings we had so far I systematically throw up. Ive had other meetings with other supervisors when I was a research assistant for instance and it didnt happen probably because the stakes are lower. What can I do to feel better ?,Stress

This past year is the first time I've had a very unhealthy relationship with food had my second child and have been nursing her. I'm a sahm with a 3 and 1 year old. All I can think about is food and eating. I'm constantly snacking and I'm always eating really bad and unhealthy options. I sometimes get healthier options but something in my brain just won't go for those in the moment and I truly feel I can't control itI know I can and should be able to but I guess my willpower sucks. I'm so sick of starting and restarting my health journey every day because I can't keep from overeating to an insane level. It's truly becoming embarrassing and I have so much shame.I also have issues with hair pulling. I'll sit and pull my hair out one strand at a time anytime I'm idle. I'm well into it before I even realize how long I've done it. I've had this issue on and off since college. I've spoken about both of these issues with my therapist this past week and all she really told me was to find a sort of fidget to use when I'm idle to keep from the hair pulling. She gave me no advice on my food issues so I hoping to continue pushing that at the next session.

Im only 29 but over the summer I was on a 2 month long holiday eating crap and thats when my stomach problems started. I had blood on my stool at the end of two months and instead of treating it as a hemmoroid because of crap food Ive been thinking I have colon cancer. Cut to the next 6 months of constant stress and anxiety and nausea and gut issues. Ive never got constipated in my life before so Im stressed about colon cancer and this is making me feel even more worried. Ive been to the doctor and he told me the blood may be due to some minor rectal irritation but nothing to worry about. He didnt check me physically though. All my blood tests and stomach ultrasound is clear but I cant get over the thought of having colon cancer as whenever Im constipated theres been blood. Im an extreme hypochondriac and im going through one of the most stressful times of my life and im worried I have colon cancer twenty four seven. Im constantly naseous and I have cramps. My stomach hasnt been the same in 7 months and I never had this problem earlier. Current symptoms stomach cramps inability to empty stomach blood on toilet paper swollen anus I can feel a swelling in the area lots of acid reflux constantly and constipated Current Mental State Life Problems My dads company shut down over night 5 Years ago both my parents literally have 0 money and we come from quite a upper class background from back in the day. They have no idea how to move forward in the future Ive had back to back 4 traumatic relationships where I feel like Ive only been dumped because of the troubles my dad is facing and no one wants to be a part of this kind of a family. Ive had men enter my lives totally support me and fly away with all my trust broken back to back and all of this has broken me. I also saw my best friend pass away in a freak fire accident 3 years ago. All my friends are married getting married and I feel constantly alone and sad. I cant cope I run my own company and Im independent enough to live my life currently but theres no security for the future and Im just constantly feeling like Im racing with time to make ends meet. I feel like no one understands the place I am in physically and mentally and my physical health is making me unable to work mentally and if I dont work I wont be able to sustain myself. I used to be a go getter constantly at the gym and now I struggle to get out of bed. I have no answers on whats happening to me .The last time I saw fresh blood was in JULY and now again In December.

48522,48520,I despise living with my family but I can't afford to move out. I've been trying to move out for years but I make jack shit for my job. Every. Single. Day. When I get home there's an issue. It is always my older sister 100. Whether it's getting back together with her ex that she got a restraining order against victimizing herself over her kids existences because one of them is crying or just being drunk she is always throwing fits and making a scene ruining everyone's day for no reason. Let alone assault you for no reason. May God forgive your ignorant soul for thinking you can be in the same building as her when she feels like throwing a temper tantrum like a 4 year old. I've talked to our mom numerous times about her. She defends her every single time sometimes I'll tell her she needs to stop enabling her and she just responds by enabling her. They're always telling me to pack my shit and go. Believe me I'd fucking love to. But even though I pay rent you know they're always holding it over my head what a parasite I am and I'd be deadhomeless without them.,Stress

48630,48632,Is this all life is supposed to be? I know life is supposed to be difficult. I know stressful things can happen and that most of us learn how to cope in a healthy way. Eating right and exercising are supposed to make us healthy and happy both physically and mentally. We're supposed to have hobbies beginner at knitting to keep us occupied and to do our duties which manifests in the job that I do almost every day. We need to have a network of support from friends and family. Life isn't just what happens to you it's how you react to it. That's what I tell myself.Yet it seems that life or at least my life is just one stressful event after another. Be it getting rearended and struggling with insurance for a few months a single parent's boyfriend showing up who stresses you out for the next few transferring from one branch to another in your job looming deadlines and the knowledge that you have to eat healthily and sleep at least 8 hours a night or you're going to get sick...etc. etc. etc. Many times I'm happy and I catch myself wondering when the next bad thing is going to happen. WITHOUT FAIL it does. I deal with it successfully and it's on to the next one! Over and over and over again catching moments of pleasure and peace in between. It's not a very good comparison but it's kind of like Dark Souls where you die your way through instead of playing your way through.I'm slowly being chipped away at. I've built an extraordinarily healthy way of living but it seems at this point that it's just a tower I've built over a foundation under continuous assault by the elements that I'm constantly repairing.I've been tired. So tired. It's like I died a long time ago and I'm only 23. I know everybody deals with constant stressors so is everyone secretly feeling this way? Is it all drowned in alcohol? drugs? Religion? Are we supposed to naturally numb ourselves with age? This can't be all that life is!My grandfather eats junk food. He stands or sits around for most of the day and sometimes he goes for a walk before coming home and eating. He's been through the Vietnam war and lost almost everything. Despite sleep apnea cancer a fatrich diet and falling once he's still thriving in his eighties. No one gets to that point unless they've got it all figured out inside.There's something obvious I'm missing something that appears to make all the difference. I don't think a girlfriend will fix this nor will any big purchases or materialism. Ideally I'd have a life of inner peace and contentment filled with steady but peaceful determination. Otherwise life has no meaning to it.,Stress

48658,48663,Being a warehouse cleaner sucks. Cant lie i got offered a office cleaning job full time and good pay so i took it. Ive done cleaning since i was 17 and just stuck with it because its easy and most of the time your left alone to just do your job in peace and go home. Im 21 now and never had a cleaning job like this. So i turn up for my 1st day and was greeted by a woman and a confused looking bloke. She said firstly have we got safety shoes and a hi vis? I looked at her confused. No? Long story short i was never told to bring either of the things because like i said i was told it was an office cleaning job so she gave me a hi vis and some borrowed shoes that were massive on me which i had to wear for 3 days because again wasnt told i needed safety shoes an i was broke af. She took me into a huge warehouse with different compartments and said this is what ill be cleaning. Along with rooms connected to the warehouse that operate massive machinery making car parts. She told this confused bloke that had only been there for a week to show me around this guy had no clue what he was doing tbh just pointed at things and told me i had to empty bins that way. Later i was then told i had to drive around this fucking monster of a cleaning machine in tight rooms never had proper training on this thing btw just got told what buttons to press and to just practice. Yeah sure Ill just practice not crashing a giant machine into stacks of metal cages whilst also dodging death. I have crashed this machine not badly luckily but have definitely been in situations that couldve killed me. The thing that really pissed me off is the fact i was struggling on driving this thing today the supervisor who was meant to be helping me didnt want to help me laughed and shyed away when i was panicking on the machine cos i couldnt get it through this gap and i didnt want to crash into big metal boxes that couldve fell on me. She got on it and started getting nervous herself being on it and hated driving it just as much as i do then started mocking how i have to drive it and she doesnt. Keep in mind shes meant to have fucking trained me to use it.From tomorrow onwards im going to use a push machine to clean the floors and if they dont like it im leaving because that job is a jobs worth and they dont give a fuck about my safety.,Stress

48780,48788,My physics class is wringing me out The more weeks go by the more helpless I feel about this course. I hate the professor I hate the lab partners I hate the TAs I hate the activities and homework we have to do and I hate physics the most.I never had a sturdy foundation in physics anyways. The only reason i managed with physics in high school was because I memorized most of the solutions and most of the problems were similar to the other problems I practiced. Besides my tutor was good at helping me learn. I'm doing an introductory physics course this semester and I feel so absolutely dumb. We're supposed to work in groups to complete activities and every week we are given a set of problems for homework. The professor adds a set of puzzles at the end of every assignment to supposedly promote logical thinking and spatial reasoning or whatever.The thing is I never really liked physics in the first place but not I hate it. The labs are for two hours I can't understand a single concept and the people in my group are so snide and rude about the fact that they understand the class and I can't. I remember asking for help about a homework problem to them on Discord and I would have been grateful if they had given me a few hints about how they solved that problem but all they did was send the wrong answers and made a bunch of memes about how they trolled me. One of the guys is so arrogant about how he took AP Physics and he knows all of the concepts and is so good at physics.Meanwhile I can't even do a single problem independently. The professor also gives a bunch of puzzles like kenkens or spatial reasoning problems that I'm too dumb to do and I'm doing the worst in that class. It's just too much for me. Aside from that course I'm in computer science and while my other classes aren't as awful they're also pretty difficult. Plus I have work study and most of my work hours coincide with the office hours. I still have to take the course as a requirement and I feel like I'm going to fail.

I was in hospital and at that time every few hours somebody is dying in front of me. I got so scared and anxiety hit me so hard that my mouth remains dry my hands were shaking my heartbeat doubles. I feels like i am going to die and this thought didn't let me sleep for 20 days straight in a row. Covid gone but now i got insomnia. I went to bed but didn't get even a single minute of sleep. I got so frustrated the days was like hell it was like somebody just take my soul out of body i don't want to live anymore. Tried melatonin Vitamin B6 Tablet Got sunlight daily nothing works. Then I consult to a doctor. She prescribed me to take clonazepam .25mg for 4 weeks and along to take mirtazapine 7.5mg. Then as per doctors suggestion i stopped taking clonazepam after 4 weeks and continued to take mirtazapine 7.5 mg. It was good for 8 months. I started exercise 30mins daily. Walk for 5 km daily. Now Few days before my body again started to facing insomnia there is no stress the insomnia comes automatically. In 10 days duration my sleep got reduced to 1 hour per day and now after 10 days i got no sleep not even a single minute. I don't know what happens to my body i talked to my close persons tell about my problem but nobody understands me. Should i give a try to homeopathy medicine?

48869,48887,Daily habits for a less stressful life Everyone wants less stress. And that is why in this post I will talk about daily habits for a less stressful life. I myself apply these habits every day in my life. So everything I talk about comes from my own experience. Once you apply the methods in this post regularly they will eventually become habits. At first it may be difficult to apply these methods because it may all feel a little strange. But once you experience the positive effects you will find enough motivation to continue.WHY YOU NEED TO CREATE DAILY HABITS FOR A LESS STRESSFUL LIFEMost people do a lot in a day. And that can be incredibly wonderful but it can also cause a lot of stress. And stress is not always bad for you. It can sometimes help you get the best out of yourself. But longterm stress can be very bad for your health. For example it can cause your immune system to deteriorate making you more likely to get sick. But it can also cause you to become irritable and your mood to deteriorate. Ultimately it can also cause you to have almost no energy or motivation left to do things. In addition to the aforementioned consequences of longterm stress there are many more consequences that you dont want to have either. And to reduce the risk of these consequences it can be helpful to create habits for a less stressful life.FOCUS ON YOUR BREATHING FOR A LESS STRESSFUL LIFESometimes people get a lot of stress because they get lost in thoughts. To prevent you from overthinking and getting stressed it is useful to sometimes focus on your breathing. For example if you are busy working or studying remind yourself to focus on your breathing once every 10 minutes. You dont have to breathe differently! Just let your breathing flow naturally but focus on it for a moment. Feel the air go in and out.MEDITATION IS ONE OF THE DAILY HABITS FOR A LESS STRESSFUL LIFEMeditation can help you unwind completely. You can meditate by sitting down and focusing on your breathing. As guidance you can say to yourself in when you inhale and out when you exhale. Then as your breathing gets deeper and slower you can say deep and slow to yourself. MAKE A DAILY HABIT OF GOING OUTSIDE FOR A LESS STRESSFUL LIFE.The environment you are in can affect how much stress you experience. Suppose you are in an environment where you are constantly receiving signals that cause stress. Such as phone calls emails or other things that remind you of stressful situations. Then it can be useful to get away from this situation for a while. And preferably it can be useful to go to a park forest lake or sea. Because in these environments there is often a lot of space and there are few or no things that cause stress.WALK MINDFULLYAnd when youre walking pay attention to your footsteps and your breathing. Inhale and take for example three steps. And then when you exhale take another three steps. Also feel how your feet touch the ground. This mindful way of walking gets you out of your head and into the moment.GO EXERCISE AND FEEL THE STRESS DISAPPEARBeing physically active is incredibly important. But its also incredibly helpful to exercise if you want to release stress. I myself really feel the stress disappear when I exercise. And if Ive trained really hard Im sometimes so tired that I dont even feel like stressing about anything anymore haha. You dont necessarily have to train super hard. The stress can also disappear during an easy workout. Or go for a jog while listening to your favorite music and feel the stress disappear.HELP YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILYI wish you much success in applying these methods for a less stressful life. Hopefully you can apply them so often that they become habits in your daily life. But I do want to ask you one more thing. I suspect that you have friends and family who also sometimes suffer from longterm stress. You can help these friends and family by sending them this post. And maybe you can start creating these habits together which will make it a lot easier for both of you. Because working together on something ensures that you motivate each other.Originally from this blog posthttpsquintenvanommen.comdailyhabitsforalessstressfullife,Stress

48886,48905,Is this a psychological condition? Or just inability to deal with stress? Hi I don't know if it's the right place to post this but lately I have been figuring out the features of a lifelong problem of mine. I would call it the simple inability to manage stress but I want to be more specific and Im curious if other people can feel the same based on how I describe it. I would describe the relation between me and stress in this way The incapacity to accept stress and everyday fatigue as a normal part of life referred also to very simple tasks The forced splitting between bad days and good days where in the bad days Im not allowed to feel good because of some stressful tasks to do that basically ruin the whole day while in the good days Im not allowed to feel stressed because Im not supposed to feel so and Im not meant to do some extra stuff that would cause some fatigue. It also ends up in hating the ending of a good day becuase tomorrow is gonna be a bad day... You know when sunday is ending and monday is the next day or also when you're coming back from a vacation Basically the inability of enjoying the moment because my mind is always projected in the future. Rejection of the idea of facing new stressful situations this becomes particulary strong whenever I just came through some stressful stuff my mind sells to me a higher level of stress toleranceperformance in a particular moment with the promise that Im not going to face new similar situations in the future... I use to motivate myself during difficult moments with the thought that afler that everything is over Im going to rest and it's gonna be a good time. But this also tricks my mind into thinking that there are not going to be similar stressful situations in the future overall which obviously can't be true. The high expectation before a supposed good day or good time is about to come... as if it's going to be a super regenerating moment for me that will restore all my power of will. This is not rational and not realistic most of the times because everyone would never get enough of a good time and unpleasant things can happen during a planned good time as well. Feeling envious towards people who are not going through a stressful moment while I am. Focusing almost in an obsessive way on other people around me who are chilled and are not facing anything difficult. In those moments I forget that everyone has stressful moments just not at the same time I am the free person when other are facing hard moments. the excessive anxiety and discomfort before a task that I know its' going to be stressful... also an easy one. As if my mind was trying to convince me that Im never supposed to be stressed and that's not normal for me doing stuff that I don't like even if they're necessary.,Stress

48977,49008,Thesis stress is driving me crazy never feel this bad for school I'm an international student in my last year of uni now but for the first time in 3.5 years I study here this is the first time I feel this bad. My thesis deadline is in less than a week and just a few days ago I received feedback that I need to change the whole structure. It takes so much time but I'm trying my best and it seems like it's getting there but I still feel so stressed. I feel like my self esteem is so low because for this whole thesis process I always feel like I'm dumb and not good enoughI don't feel like eating anything because everything suddenly taste like paper for me. Everyday I wake up the first thought is about my thesis and I feel like I couldn't afford break. Yesterday I worked on my thesis from 9am to 1130pm without a break more than 10 minutes. I also feel like crying but also feel like I can't afford the time to cry at this point. I want to give up so bad but I can't afford it. My parents spent excessive amount of money for me to study abroad and I feel like I need to graduate. I don't know what to do...I understand that I should keep going it's only a few days more but I can't stand this constant anxiety and I feel like I could burst at any time,Stress

48991,49024,Bizzare Dreams I used to smoke weed for about 15 years and during that time I almost never had dreams sleep was just empty space and I kind of preferred that. I quit smoking about 5 months ago and ever since then I've had really bizzare dreams every night without fail. Only about 2 of my dreams are enjoyable and the rest range from not so good to absolutely bizzare. I suffer from pretty extreme stress on a daily basis which seems to bleed into my dreams so I often wake up feeling like halfway between reality and obscurity which lingers for hours after I wake up. This is quite unpleasant. Is there any way to have more control over what my dreams are about or to stop dreaming entirely? I'm almost ready to pick up smoking again just to make it stop.,Stress
48996,49029,I live at my parents house I don't have to pay bills I don't have a job I don't study BUT I still feel stressed out and exhausted. Even without a job and responsibilities I still have so many things that I have to do or worry about. Why is life so stressful? What can I do about it? I have to work on my health. I have to make doctor appointments. I have to go to therapists. I have to maintain my friendships. I have to figure out which religion I'm going to follow I believe in God but was grown up atheist so religion is what I'm figuring out currently. I have to deal with friends that got mad at me or are about to leave me. I have to deal with my mental issues. I have to fix my laptop and my phone. I have to figure out what career I wanna do in my life. I have to enjoy free time. And alot more things that I didnt think of right now.I have to to so many things that it drains all my energy and motivation. If I had a job or was still studying it would have been MUCH worse for me. Its the reason why I was forced to quit studying earlier this year.I worry about so many things and I have so many things on my todo list it is simply more than I can handle. This feels like a 168 hours per week job that never ends.And yes I do take free time to relax. I play videogames I go outside for walks and ofcourse I sleep. HOWEVER I always feel guilty when forcing myself to have free time. I have so many things on my todo list which is growing bigger every day I should be working hard to prevent my todo list from getting bigger right now but I'm wasting my time on entertainment right now. With this feeling in the back of my mind I cannot really enjoy free time that I take which feels like cheating its like borrowing money because youre in big debt but here I'm borrowing free time from the future because I'm in big debt I cannot relax. No matter what I do. Whetner I'm working on my have to's or trying to relax with free time I always feel like there is so much that I still have to do and my motivation is completely 0.My life has too many have to activities which I cannot all do at the same time but I always feel guilty about not working as hard as I could. On the other side I completely have no motivation to work on anything.My todo list grows bigger every day and it's making me insane.,Stress
49010,49043,Creating the Time You Need to Do the Things You Love Time is at a premium these days. Its hard to find anyone that complains about having too much time on their hands. Most of us are so busy with work family and various obligations theres little time left to do the things wed really like to do!Its not easy to find time to pursue your passions but there will be a way. Use these techniques to create the time you require for important pursuits Decide what you want to make room for. The best way to motivate yourself to create more free time in your life is to identify what you want to make time for! What are the most important things youd like to spend more time on? Figure out how youd spend that extra time and make sure you have some good reasons. Create a list of reasons that give you an emotional response. Being logical is unlikely to inspire you. Use your mornings wisely. Most people waste their mornings. They stay in bed as long as possible and barely manage to get to work on time each day. Make the most of your mornings. Go to bed earlier and get up earlier. Its often easier to do something worthwhile in the morning than in the evening. What are you missing by going to bed earlier? Probably not a lot.Understand the ways you waste time. Were quite ingenious at wasting time. Watch yourself for a day and write down all the ways you waste time. When you understand where your time is leaking away you can start working on solutions.Make a schedule. A schedule can keep you on track and help to ensure that your time is being spent wisely. A schedule can help to minimize the amount of time you waste. You can also build time into your schedule to do the things you enjoy the most.Delegate. Create more time for yourself by utilizing the people around you. This can work at work and at home. Theres a good chance that someone in your life would benefit from being delegated to. Put your employees coworkers children and partner to work! A little help can free up quite a bit of time.Prioritize and eliminate. Perhaps you just have too many nonessential things going on in your life. It might be time to cut back on a few of those obligations. Take a look at everything you do each dayweekmonth and think about how much value those things add to your life. You can probably find something to remove from your life. You can find time if you have a good enough reason! Determine what you want to create time for and make it happen. Delegate schedule eliminate and avoid wasting time. What are you willing to give up to spend time on the things you love?,Stress

I know irritability isn't exactly rare with stress. However I've realized that when I get stressed I get extremely irritable. No matter the magnitude of my stress small or large I feel like anything can set me off.How do I better suppress this irritability?

Well yesterday I was given a ridiculous deadline for a project that requires a ton of work and man hours. I reported the email with the deadline to HR stating it completely unrealistic and that it's starting to affecting my mental health. I have taken off the past two days due to my anxiety being so bad that I can barely function.I am seriously considering going to my doctor and asking for a stress leave from work.

49113,49152,Burnout? I think I may have burnout. This past semester Ive been juggling a lot more than Im typically used too with 5 classes a remote practicum and two additional jobs. I also have a horse I am responsible for and feel guilty I havent had the time to spend with him that he deserves though he is well taken care of at a boarding facility. My practicum in specific has been a great deal of stress for me. Long story but basically I was convinced to go into an area I have relatively little knowledge about and contrary to what I was told discovered there was little to any support and structure. Im a bit of a perfectionist so not knowing what to do has caused me great anxiety. Both my jobs can also be fastpaced and stressful so I dont get much of a break from the stress. In the past two months my norm has been anxiety driven heart palpitations or absolute exhaustion. It has only gotten worse with time. I broke up with my bf in Jan due to having little time and besides him all my friends have moved away. The only nearby support I really have is my parents. I love my mother but she does not understand this kind of of mental burnout. I go to her because she has been a great sense of comfort over the years but when I try and explain my burnout she starts yelling and thinks I havent been working hard due to being in my room all day misconception with remote learning thinking computer surfing the net and otherwise being tired. Ultimately this just makes me more stressed and the cycle continues. I really dont know what to do at this point. I cant afford counselling and last I checked the university farmed their counselling services out so that they are nearly inaccessible now though this may have changed with regulations relaxing so I will look into it. Any other suggestions?,Stress
49143,49187,Am I choosing the right mindeset? I wonder.. is it my stress time management or myself as a person in general that is blocking myself from doing the best I can? Or is it my anxiety and overthinking getting to me?I am a F14 in my freshman year of high school currently going through a roller coaster of thoughts and emotions. I'm trying really hard managing between piano soccer and my grades with school. I love everything equally well maybe except school.. but in the end my grades are my priority over piano or soccer. I know that piano and soccer may benefit me throughout high school but grades are more important. But that doesn't mean I'm going to give up on neither one. But here I am with a B 84.5 in my history class and I need to get it to an A 90.1 by the end of my school final which is in about 2 months. Well I'll need an A at least so I could take AP Euro in my sophomore year and it's only available in my sophomore year as well. AP Euro is definitely not a necessity for my next year in high school but it'll benefit me a lot and as my school is very tough and competitive I want to achieve my goal and do it. My teacher is crazy strict being 87 years old he has his more olderfashioned and more understandable ways of grading. So I stress trying to fit into his perfect standards but at the end of the day I keep telling myself. In the future there will always be people that will be wanting a perfect requirement that fits them. I will need to be able to be adjusting to those specific requirements for the future to benefit myself and my ideal career future and more.I've never gotten a B or a grade range in the B section B B or B throughout middle school and my first semester of high school until now. Is it the stress that's piling on me after all these hard schoolwork I'm not managing well or enough with my time that I have? My sleep schedule is actually horrid I usually sleep at 24AM waking up at 6AM with soccer practice 34 times a week usually I skip at least 1 day a week since it's a little too much and 2 lessons of piano a week. Also including the clubs I've decided to join Mock Trials which is now coming to an end with competitions. Volunteering which I guess I could choose which days to help out.. but.. The homework. The load at my school is actually crazy about 23 assignments new each period which is every day so in a week total about 3040 assignments which is quite a buttload. It's due either the following days or sometimes a miracle as it is it'll be due next week. But then again there's at least 12 tests a week which I need to study a lot for. Oh of course there's also the projects and essays let's add about 1 for every other week. Should I take a break from piano or soccer and put my grades at my priority instead? I think I can be able to take my grade 84.5 up to a 90.1 at least which is 6 of a percentage raise that I'll need to be okay. Telling my friends this all I get in response is the same It'll be okay. All I wish these days is someone to tell me more than it'll be okay. I'm still new to the environment of high school and figuring out what fits for me and what doesn't fit for me. Encouragement something I haven't heard in awhile is what I hope boosts me. Thanks for reading this far.TLDR Not having the most decent grade in history class 84.5 wanting to take AP Euro next year for my class I need at least a 90.1 for my requirement to join the class. Struggling with the management of piano and soccer as well for my extracurricular activities as well as school clubs should I take a break from something? I need to put my grades before other stuff including the fact to not freak out with studying and use time well. Also wish someone could tell me I'm able to do it and they have confidence in me. Thanks again.,Stress

Since Sunday evening my whole body has been in extreme pain and I just have that feeling I get when Im sick with something like a cold or the flu. But those are my only symptoms. Ive had 2 negative Covid tests and just got a negative flu test from the doctor where they also did some lab work and gave me a prescription for my pain. The only other explanation I can think of for the cause of this is that I got extremely depressed and stressed out last week. Im not new to stress or depression though and Ive never had this type of reaction before.Just wondered if anyone had any ideas or has experienced anything like this.

49198,49246,Does anyone feel the same? I was wondering if someone recognizes the feelings I have sometimes because I feel like I am weird and alone. I've read about anxiety and think that's what I have... But there's so much info online that I do not know for sure.I get minor panic attacks on random moments and I can not seem to find any reason why. The most recent example is when I was asked to go on a team meeting outside of working hours. I felt almost frightened and felt like I wanted to cry and life is too overwhelming for me. Another example is a party I recently went to I was scared to go for about two weeks even though my gf and a friend were with me. There was literally nothing bad about it but I was stressed up until the moment I got there.When I try to think of a reason why I'm feeling like that I do not have a single clue. My life is good and I have everything I needwant but I keep looking for small things that make me feel unhappy and anxious. I can stay awake and panicoverthink over all kinds of small things like this. I just want to feel happy and stop overthinking constantly but I do not know how to do that. Sometimes I think it will get better when I'll get older 25y right now. But the negative feelings are taking over more frequently and I am ready to start working on it so I can actually enjoy life.

Hes kind willing to help and available for me. If you ask me I wouldnt even say that I feel stressed before the meetings in the sense that Im not overthinking Im not having this bowl of stress in my belly that one could have facing pressure. Yet I dont know why systematically 105 minutes before the meeting I go to the toilet and I throw up everything I have even if I had a light breakfast before. I really dont know what can I do to stop this because it doesnt feel like the problem is coming from me. It feels like I have no other choice but to throw up. Obviously its linked to the fact that Im going to apply to a PhD and the fact that hes a very knowledgeable man in his field and theres probably a bit of impostor syndrome playing. But whats worrying me is the fact that of all the 1012 meetings we had so far I systematically throw up. Ive had other meetings with other supervisors when I was a research assistant for instance and it didnt happen probably because the stakes are lower. What can I do to feel better ?,Stress

I didnt have my own room before I left to college.

It was fine at the moment because I was away at college and I had a house near my school. Now that Im about to graduate and hopefully move back home to save money I have brought up this issue if I could get the room back but instead of hearing me out they had stated that I can just go to the library study.

49337,49396,Dealing with constant stress on top of that have fallen sick and worried I have cancer Im dealing with a really bad gut situation . Im only 29 but over the summer I was on a 2 month long holiday eating crap and thats when my stomach problems started. I had blood on my stool at the end of two months and instead of treating it as a hemmoroid because of crap food Ive been thinking I have colon cancer. Cut to the next 6 months of constant stress and anxiety and nausea and gut issues. Ive never got constipated in my life before so Im stressed about colon cancer and this is making me feel even more worried. Ive been to the doctor and he told me the blood may be due to some minor rectal irritation but nothing to worry about. He didnt check me physically though. All my blood tests and stomach ultrasound is clear but I cant get over the thought of having colon cancer as whenever Im constipated theres been blood. Im an extreme hypochondriac and im going through one of the most stressful times of my life and im worried I have colon cancer twenty four seven. Im constantly naseous and I have cramps. My stomach hasnt been the same in 7 months and I never had this problem earlier. Current symptoms stomach cramps inability to empty stomach blood on toilet paper swollen anus I can feel a swelling in the area lots of acid reflux constantly and constipated Current Mental State Life Problems My dads company shut down over night 5 Years ago both my parents literally have 0 money and we come from quite a upper class background from back in the day. They have no idea how to move forward in the future Ive had back to back 4 traumatic relationships where I feel like Ive only been dumped because of the troubles my dad is facing and no one wants to be a part of this kind of a family. Ive had men enter my lives totally support me and fly away with all my trust broken back to back and all of this has broken me. I also saw my best friend pass away in a freak fire accident 3 years ago. All my friends are married getting married and I feel constantly alone and sad. I cant cope I run my own company and Im independent enough to live my life currently but theres no security for the future and Im just constantly feeling like Im racing with time to make ends meet. I feel like no one understands the place I am in physically and mentally and my physical health is making me unable to work mentally and if I dont work I wont be able to sustain myself. I used to be a go getter constantly at the gym and now I struggle to get out of bed. I have no answers on whats happening to me .The last time I saw fresh blood was in JULY and now again In December. Its fresh and very little but enough to make my mind spiral and think Im dying I cant switch off my brain and Im constantly burning farting and have reflux too! Do you think stress anxiety are making my symptoms worse? I love to drink and I cant even touch a drink thinking my stomach will spasm and bleed which makes me even more nervous and anxious. Im at a loss of words and I cant live a normal life. I want to switch off from the thought that I have a serious disease. Someone please help,Stress
49341,49400,I despise living with my family but I can't afford to move out. I've been trying to move out for years but I make jack shit for my job. Every. Single. Day. When I get home there's an issue. It is always my older sister 100. Whether it's getting back together with her ex that she got a restraining order against victimizing herself over her kids existences because one of them is crying or just being drunk she is always throwing fits and making a scene ruining everyone's day for no reason. Let alone assault you for no reason. May God forgive your ignorant soul for thinking you can be in the same building as her when she feels like throwing a temper tantrum like a 4 year old. I've talked to our mom numerous times about her. She defends her every single time sometimes I'll tell her she needs to stop enabling her and she just responds by enabling her. They're always telling me to pack my shit and go. Believe me I'd fucking love to. But even though I pay rent you know they're always holding it over my head what a parasite I am and I'd be deadhomeless without them.,Stress

49358,49418,Stress Relief in Making Things So last year I went to a diner with my gf and I had myself a cappuccino for the first time. I've never tasted anything so delicious and I made it a goal to learn how to go about making one. After Christmas I got myself an espresso machine. It would be a few months before I used it lack of space where I live but I finally got it set up back in November. My first drink well... I never used a steam wand before. I watched some YouTube videos my second cup was EXACTLY like what I had at that diner. Now I make about 3 cups a week or so usually to keep warm more than anything and it's expanding to where I got a coffee grinder so I'm not restricted by grind. If I want whole beans I can work with them now. If I'm unsure what grind the bag I have is pour some in the grinder to make sure.Was it expensive? Well getting everything together was about 260. With all the payment apps out there it's affordable. You can make tons of stuff too. Lattes mochas I'll make hot chocolate with this thing. And I love it. If I have guests I always offer to make them something. I found zen in the process satisfaction in these product and a desire to expand on what I know. It really makes me feel better knowing I can make something that not only I can enjoy but friends and family can as well.My advice? Learn a craft that you enjoy. If you like painting or even coloring there's plenty of resources. If you like writing maybe get a voice recorder for story ideas that pop up and expand on that for a bit. If you like food all kinds of classes out there. But all in all make something for you first.,Stress
49362,49422,I cant seem to handle the stress from any job I am 22 and I started a new job 2 weeks ago where I work from home doing mainly administrative tasks. Ive started hating it I have a lot of work and since I am new everything takes ages to finish. I am getting so stressed to the point that I think about work all the time instead of enjoying life. I quit my previous job after 5 months because I also found it to be stressful there I had a lot less work and looking back it was not stressful. Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this stress? Also any ideas on less stressful jobs? I feel like I am stuck in the corporate cycle and not sure how I can get out. I cant seem to find a job which I would enjoy,Stress
49367,49427,Cold water immersion for stress relief Im currently on day 12 of getting in ice water for 15 minutesday. And I have to say its the most powerful stress reliever Ive come across. I meditate minimum 30 minutes a day but nothing compares to cold water.I sleep like a baby and for the rest of the day feel calm and in control. I dont plan on stopping anytime soon the benefits seem to far outweigh my being uncomfortable for the time in the water,Stress
49371,49431,Can stress cause things like this? Only meds I've tried is low grade anxiety meds. And I'm unsure what bloods. My doc ran more thursday said he'd call if anything was different. They tested for that one thing that starts with a T that checks for damage in the heart or recent HA's. And during the echocardiogram my Hr was 130. She noted it was fast but then 2 weeks later I get a call. Holter didn't show anything super concerning and the echo was fine. I am under tons of anxiety and stress but whatever is going on has had me bed ridden with neck pain dizziness headaches and heart discomfort . The fast HR and pounding feeling for literally months essentially with no breaks. My entire life has been Halted because I can't do anything. I take a shower and my heart goes a million miles an hour and my blood pressure goes to the 140's over 90. Brain fog and dizziness. Tinnitus like crazy and this weird whooshing sound and pain from my neck .It all started with going to the doctor bc I had Thunderclap headaches after orgasm which lasted everytime for 2 weeks then just stopped. Then I started feeling worse and that stopped but all this started. I've had an echocardiogram several EKGs from the ER visits an MRI 3 months ago no contrast a CT with contrast of my chest and neck last month a CT with contrast of my head last week. Noone can find anything. Only suggestion my doc had Thursday was potentially ICP and he looked worri3d that's what it was and said if I get a headache go to the er. Which I did 2 days ago to which they didn't do bloodwork but they did a CT and Xray . Tested my eye movement . Then gave me a shot and sent me home. I obviously need to continue to see my doctor and will. Just 4 months of this I'm trying to reach out for things to recommend to my doctor to test for and try because they're struggling hard. The only things I can even think of personally anymore is craniocervical instability anxiety and maybe clogged artery issues. With the ICP he thought which is phesable I have 95 percent of the symptoms but the numerous head CTs and the MRI showing no pressuredoesn't rule it out and the fact that it's been 4 months since it all began and I've not stroked out or anything makes it seem not entirely sure for me personally. But I'm not a doc ill continue to do what they tell me but man if I can I wanna try to nudge them the right way,Stress

6980,7000,I have so many stressors in my life all major things that tear me down. Every day I fight a battle not just with my mental health but with the world. Last night I finally broke. After 33 years of a shit show of a life I am done. What ultimately triggered this is that my son 7m with ADHD has been expelled from holiday club. I quit my job Jan 2020 because he was not coping in school and managed to find him a specialist educational provider as well as get him on medication. He did brilliantly! I however hated being a SAHM and a carer. The loneliness is overwhelming and the fact that I only live to provide food and a clean house to 3 children. So I started to think about going back to work in my area of specialty which is law. I got a job with a police department. Something for me and something where I will meet other adults without being attached to my children. I got all 3 of my children into a childcare provider and settled them in over months. I have officially been working for less than 2 weeks and my son has regressed back to his bad behaviour. He has been kicked out and now I have to quit my job and go back to being his full time carer. I cannot do this for the next 11 years of his life and possibly beyond that. I do not want to live anymore and there is no help out there for my situation. I can go back on antidepressants I can go to therapy but none of these things fix my problem that I no longer have any autonomy over my life. I am not a person any more I am merely a mum with no identity other than that of my children. I find no pleasure in anything and exhaust myself pretending to be happy for the sake of my family. I cannot work and now as it turns out I cannot even die. I cannot leave behind my children I am their only parent. I have no control in this life over anything. I now think I am too far gone to ever feel happy again. I want to die. I cannot go back to Groundhog Day,Suicidal
6996,7016,My life has always been a mess but now I am at a point where I do not have much energy left to go on any further. Every second is tormenting me. I have made several mistakes that threw what is been left of me and my life completely off the rails and now I am devastated. I do not have any perspectives whatsoever and self hate eats me. What can I do? Nothing is fun anymore and I have no one. It gets worse everyday. People are trying to help me and they really do see what I am saying but they do not know how to help me either and they are professionals. I am in mental hospitals most of the time but it does not help. I do not know what to do anymore I feel horrible,Suicidal

I know he will not be in my life forever and when he starts college I will not have much chance to see him anymore. I really do not want us to just slowly drift apart and stop talking. I do not want to be alone. I already have nothing to live for and if hes gone as well there will not be anything worth staying alive for. I hate myself for loving someone,Suicidal

7096,7116,I am 23 and I could not even get a job at McD because the manager told me they only wanted permanent staff members not a temporary one. I am so pissed off because they could have specified that bit on the web page at least instead of the whole parttime and fulltime thing. I prepped so hard for 3 days and even answered the interview questions like a breeze and it all came down to the Are you looking to be a permanent member here?. I am probably a dumbass for not even seeing this coming but holy crap I am depressed as hell. Please pardon me for venting I am sorry I am just stressed out right now I am tired of feeling like a dissapointment to everything. there is probably some other bloke having it worse right now and maybe I do not deserve feeling like this. I am unemployed and an engineering degree is not doing me anything right now because of all the smarter people having better coping mechanisms than I did not even a 21 can save my skinny ass all these First class degrees coming up faster than Covid. I cannot even get a job to save me out of a hole because of that one question. Fuck it I cannot even busk with my acoustic guitar because there is way too many professional and good quirky artists in the streets.I want to die so bad right now I hate having to be a fucking Asian with expectations of being something in this world. do not get me started on student loans and family relatives speaking out loud how you went overseas and not even getting any source of income. it is not ones fault I get that. But I do not know how long I have it in me to just keep trying. I am just tired. I am just so tired of realizing you are so close to something and fucking it up over and over and over again. Sorry Mel Jay Mom Dad I do not know what to do anymore. No ones going to read this post just like how I am just going to be passing by in this place. I cannot keep up anymore. it is too tough for me and I am being like a bitch right now but fuck it. At least if its over it would not hurt anymore. I am sorry I am so sorry for messing up and being like this. do not be like me. Please. I feel like I triggered my own mental state for not even handling this situation well. I am just so tired. I cannot even get a McD job because of one interview question,Suicidal
7107,7127,Distress lines are shit. I mean its out of best intentions so its fine.I always feel despair when I desire a quick and least painful method. But I do not have a gun with me and I believe that is the way to go for the method.I have been planning to do it on my birthday. But an argument with a friend last night made me feel more suicidal. The way he said stuff against me forced me to say things in favor of him.He tells me stop playing the victim and thinks my suicide is a way to display my ego.I want to end my life since I feel ugly unwanted worthless and insignificant. I have attachment issues too and i constantly feel alone.I do not want my suicide to show myself off as a superior being. He thinks its to display moral superiority which I have no clue what that is. I never saw him as inferior I saw him as a trusted friend. I have no one talk to right now when I am thinking about suicide,Suicidal

I know there are people worse off than me I know that but I just cannot seem to get a day off from this and I have just had a gutful. I do not want this anymore this life I mean obv I do not want to be ill anymore. I cannot handle this I am too weak too too weak. Oh for goodness sake please somebody or something make it stop.

Vacation seems to be a distressor for me as the last time I went on a vacation on a plane I seemed to have a few episodes 3 years ago conveniently while now I just came back from another vacation on a plane for the first time since then. I feel okay on the plane rides but after the vacations I go on to have suicidal thoughts for months. I do not know what to do. do not really think that the vacations are connected to the thoughts as it is been a few days since but when on vacation last time it was during the vacation. I know I am rambling and making no sense on a tangent but it is more of a stream of consciousness. Thanks for hearing me out. Might just go to bed.

7307,7327,I am a piece of shit. a horrible friend a horrible son and a horrible brother. My whole family is tired of my shit. I tried to explain to my mom how i felt about a lot of things in my childhood and i was too harsh. Over the past couple of months I have realized that this whole time she is been a caring and supporting mother.....I am just a piece of shit. I do not help her out financially or in the house even though she has a condition that has made her visually impaired. I have become this sad looser 23 year old that lives with his mom and just stays in his room in a pit of my own fantasies and self pity........I have been thinking that I am a narcissist and I am now seeing the effects of all of that on my family. They loose more respect for me as the days go by. They say everything is fine but i know they are just trying to be polite. I am a bum. they all no it and none of them like to be around me. I forget important things about their life and barely take care of them or show them love. I have been in a spiral for a while and its heading its peak. The only thing i can do on this fucking earth now is to take care of my mom try to get a good job to support her and that is the only reason I am still here. I am disorganzied distracted lazy. I genuinly think my famile would better and more stable if i died. They will not have to look at me being a dissapointment everyday. try to rely on me as family should and me fail everytime be a burden to them. I cannot keep doing this to them. I am tired of failing at being a functioning social human everyday. I should die and set them free. Or is this just some shitty cowardly way out for me to absole all responsibility...................god I am a piece of shit. I have fallen so far down the rabbit hole and i think I am just going to let myself fall,Suicidal
7328,7348,I was a normal good looking guyteen.Not bragging not like I was a playa or anything but my looks was not a concern. I had active social life and would do things without thinking going parties nights out friends etc.Of course lockdown now but this been a few years.In early 20s I notice my hair falling out. I started using sun beds and tanning without suncream because I thought it I go bald I need look dark as white people look sick when bald.My idea was to burn my skin so it is permanently dark.Fast forward a few years not only is my once luxiourios long thick hair half disappeared my face looks like a burns victim. I stopped the sun bathing due to this this my skin is white anyway the irony but all saggy and scarred qnd aged. Fant even hide it with my long hair as I have no long hair so my face is fully visible now. So Combine this with my thin receding hair I have gone from looking like a boy band teen to I am going to some hideous creature.When we people take pics when I have to go out work or family etc restarts they always upload pics without me. The ones with me do not go on Facebook etc...it is obvious they do not want my fuked up face on social media and I do not blame them.Now the issue as a result before covid I avoid everything. No spontaneous life anymore. Going out for 2 or 3 days in a row. Random parties or nights out. I just became a recluse.I need to always carry or wear a hat i couosnt dare sleep over some place now. I live in constant fear over my looks.I hoped lockdown would make me feel less missing out as everyone same boat and time to avoid sun use creams fix my skin improve diet hope hair improve.But over 18 months my hair is worse and face not look any better.Well nobody is going out anyway with covid round here but I still feel my life is fuked because I had it all.I looked normal and had social fun life now I am just constant obsessing and looking mirror qns almost crying.I cannot even look mirror anymore to soul destroying only in dim lights.I cannot believe only some years ago my skin was perfect and hair amazing long.Of course hair loss can happen but I see people grandparents with still nice skin so that is all my stupid fault qnd cannot improve it.Depresses me every day.I eat well workout in good shape I gueas etc but all seems pointless Is it stupid to be suicidal due to appearance,Suicidal
7330,7350,All my life my family has been toxic and I have always suffered from depression and severe anxiety.. I started cutting around the time I entered middle schoolI turned 19 a month ago but for the past 3 years everything has gotten worse. My older sister emotionally and verbally abuses me and my family. She used to say once I turned 18 she would fight me I thought about killing myself just to avoid everything. But I did not and now I am 19. I do not want to really get into details but believe me when I say the past 3 years have been hell I am exhaustedmy sister would threaten our lives and her own. Using everything she could against us. We kicked her out many times but she let us herself back in. The police have been to my house thousands of times. I know she struggles with mental issues and she is in pain too but now I am exhausted and my depression and anxiety have worsened. I have recently turned to drugs I am abusing them so badly everyday I get high if I can drink Ill get wasted I have also recently started having sneaky links to feel something. The first time I cried while doing stuff because I know its wrong but I also just do not care.I am self destructing and the worst thing is I am witnessing myself do it and I cannot stop it. I have become so numb to the world around meand when I am actually happy I feel guilty because I know my mom and the kids are sad with the situation.I have wanted to move out but if I do I am leaving them behind to deal with my sisterwell I guess either way Id be leaving them.I do not want to die but I am tired of waking up to this numb feeling. I have medication but I think need something stronger now. Lately I have been having cutting urges. I am just so lost i do not know what to do anymore somebody pleasehelp me my intrusive thoughts have never been this bad I do not know if I can do this anymore and I am scared I am going to end it. I am scared I am going to kill myself..,Suicidal
7349,7369,Tell me I am wrong but you cannot. You know its true either you let the pandemic kill you or you be proactive and beat the pandemic to it. I wish the CDC and WHO would be intellectually honest and just admit there is no way life is worth living anymore and that they just recommend suicide already. Every day I stay alive I am supplied more and more proof the only escape from this pandemic is suicide.,Suicidal
7408,7428,Five days ago I decided that I am going to do it today. I had it all planned out and wrote a note and all.I promised my best friend that I will go to a roadtrip with him. Then I wanted to have some time to cuddle with my girlfriend and then go to work and do it. I work as a night receptionist so I thought it would give me enough time and space to clear my mind and get myself to do it.And I keep climbing to the roof and I cannot do it... I keep trying saying no and going back to reception in order to cry uncontrollably for 5 mins and then just continue working for another 35. If I found some new meaning in life I would be happy but everything seems as fucking desperate as it was. I do not feel like I am any better than I was I do not deserve nor want to be here any more than 5 days ago when I planned it out.So at this point I am just venting because i do not know what is happening. I want to jump but I cannot make myself do it. I feel stuck in this limbo or whatever it is. I thought I was going to do it today,Suicidal

Last time I was in the hospital they said my CPTSD is critical and I need like the life saving help.So last week told my mom I need something more something impatient something where I can actually heal if you forgive me the right treatment. Her advice was basically stopped being a little bitch and just go back to the 24hour hold.Then I called her 30 days ago and said I cannot fucking do this I am going to kill myself and I do not want to but I need like intense intervention right now or I am going to lose my fight.Her response was I do not know what to do but should I call the police on you......Now 2 days after which is now today she calls me and leaves a voicemail cuz I was on the phone with two other lines already like one was I was on hold and the other one was actively like having a conversation. She send s this sulky guilt trippy fake I care about you I really need to know how you are doing' So I actually tried to call back because there is not maybe she wanted to finally help me. 6 hours later she finally picks up and says you know I have friends and people and places to be You do not need to be calling me all the time. And I said yeah like always there is always something before me. And then I told her I figured out the trip that she takes quite often is hours shorter than a drive to me..... So why have not you showed up.She says I do not have an answer I cannot talk to you right now you are always being an hassle and hung upSo in case I was not feeling it desperate as soon as I am before......

7453,7473,They knew about my depression and they made fun of it and choose to hurt me. They even made fun of the fact that I did not kill myself. They hurt someone who was already broken inside and they are proud of it.I do not want to be in pain anymore. They won. Nobody cares,Suicidal
7457,7477,I am lifeless I live only for the hope to be with the one who will understand me. Its impossible to describe the pain I have felt emotionally.

I see straight through everyone everyone I have known have all been fake I know they do not care about me. I have cried myself to sleep multiple times this year. I feel like I am the only one going through this even though I am not. I try and I try to be the best person that I can be someone who can be accepted by others. I want to die. Whenever I feel an ounce of happiness the pain always comes back to me. I am tired of living.,Suicidal

Hopefully that will be soon. what is the point of life if you have no basic social skills?,Suicidal

7574,7594,Last year I had the worst day of my life. March 15 2020 I was across the country in my dream grad program. I was two days into a semester and my colleagues from all around the country and I were all enamored with each others brilliance. Id never felt so connected to another group of people. Two days and four hours into the semester the sudden spike of covid19 deaths caused my school to shut down and send us all home. For the past year I have been separated from my flock and last week we were reunited at last. This week has been everything I dreamed of for the past year and my vaccinated friends and I are soaking in each others presence. Today the bomb dropped again. Due to the increase in the delta variant we are being sent home again. I had a ptsd flashback to the first time we were sent home and could not get ahold of myself. Every time I am here it is far too brief and it is even more painful to say goodbye this time. I was to graduate next week and my classmates and I will likely never see each other again. Now I am suddenly going home to no job because that too is once again suspended due to the delta variant. Because of the unvaccinated people in my country I am forced to lose out on the only thing that gave my life any meaning anymore and I am being forced to relive the most traumatic day of my life. Its hard to see the point anymore and I am thinking of ending it all when I get home. I cannot do this again,Suicidal
7579,7599,I am the because of all of the world's problems and the worst person ever. I murdered millions of people by causing the pandemic. I should die by lethal injection,Suicidal
7584,7604,This has been a long time coming. I have had depression since I was 9 years old and I am 28 now turning 29 in November. I have decided to end it on the 20th anniversary. How can that be? I am not sure but when I look back at my life all I see are fleeting moments of happiness followed by long periods of misery. My family might find this so I am not going to mention them but the time has come. After all my attempts to get help to get on medication to try coping strategies I just cannot do it anymored. Today for the millionth time I called out of work because I cannot take the pressure. Today for the millionth time I turned down a guy online bc all men see me for is a good time. My overall depression leads to my lack of motivation which is why I keep losing jobs. I am pathetic and worthless. I am both lonely and alone. I have decided to call 911 right before and do it while my roommate is away. I am hoping my last days will be good ones. I am Ready,Suicidal

7692,7712,that is the question I have been asking myself for months. I am underage less than 15 and I think I can asked myself that fricking question. I live with my mom and my two sisters my dad live in another country with another family. But I do not care that is not why I am asking myself that. One of my sisters 14 years old said when I wad 56 that I was a big baby and that I just needed to suck up my problems and grow up because that is what adults do. I was 5 why the fvck you want me to act like an adult ?! But I was little and she was the sister I admired so I did it. My other sister 17 years old was the one that I was not really talking to because of our age difference. But we had the same interest book anime japan culture... so we started talking more and more together. But I sincerelly regret it. She thinks that just because she is older than me she can do what my mom do scolding me when I do something wrong and all that. And she think it but WAY too much. Example one of the day her best friend was home I did some noise will drinking my chocolate milk and she smashed my head on the cup and I started crying and bleeding. Her friend told her that she was exagerating and to say sorry or help me but no she think it was the right thing and she does not cared. Example 2 I started fighting with her verbally and she pinned me against the sofa hurting my shoulders and I pushed her in stomach so I cn go to my room. But there my other sis 14 literally started beating me up till I was on the floor crying and screaming stop ! It hurts ! Stop fucking beating me !!! And my sis 17 said stop ! do not get physical ! But she was the one pushing me on the sofa. When I called my mom she said she did not want to know anything. Example 3 yesterday 27 july 2021 i was playing fortnite with my cousin 10 and stepsis 10. I am used to curse but they know I was sarcastic. I said shut the f up to my step sis and syam 17 yo big sis name started yelling at me do not talk like that like i xas talking ti this bitch. Then she said things like y you responding because that is how a conversation works and at the end she said to you think I am your friend and i was like well i do not pick people with such petsonnality as my friend BUT since i wanted to finish that argument i just said uh... no ? And she smashed my head on the switch i was playing with. I screaming WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU ??? and pushed her in the stomch so that crazy would go away. In conclusion i have a scratch on my face that i will maybe keep 4ever. Yesterday because of that I scarified myself. Its been 13 days I did not do it. I do not care about the mark but the fact she would want it on my face is what hurts. I tried to end my life multiple times since I was 9. The first time was because a person in my family rped me. Since that I cannot feel pleasure in life and even if I did forgive that person she is still horrible with me. My sexuality is a problem. My mom said you are lucky I accept you. Like if you do not think you will accept me why you did a kid ? But some people get kicked out so I guess I am lucky. My gender is a problem. I identify myself as a genderfluid person but hehim pronous are the one I love the most even if I use all pronous even it. Who am I is a problem. I need to smile. Always. Even if I am just eating. My mom said these exact wordsSmile. I said SMILE ! Ugh !!! Why will not you smile ?? it is not like you are unhappy either ??? Do you even have a reason to not be hapoy to smile ??? Well do I have a reason to smile and to be happy while I am not doing anything except eating ? And last but not least what I asked. I never asked to be born to live with my mother to go see friends to go to someone is birthday to live to be feed to have a house or go to school. I only asked a few things and one of them is to go see a therapist. I asked it. I asked it three time. But even if she said yes she did not do anything. And so what am i supposed to do ???I am supposed to smile if I am not ? I am supposed to stay with my mom because she fighted for me for years even if she do not care about my mental health or well being ? I am supposed to let my sisters hit me just because they are a few years older ? I am supposed to do things but how can I do them if I cannot even take care of myself ? What am I supposed to do ?,Suicidal
7712,7732,I have decided I am finally going through with it. I do not want to keep living and nothing is worth living. Ik my mother will be upset but with how I feel and the things she has done through my life I cannot find it in me to care anymore. I have one friend or had one friend I have convinced myself they do not actually like me at all and only talk to me because they idk pity me maybe or feel like they are required to check up on me. So I doubt Ill hurt them by leaving they will prob be better off if I left anyways. All I need now is to work up the courage to finally end it which I am having a hard time with I am scared of the pain but I think some pain is worth never feeling again. Idk when to do it but before next year for sure. Hopefully in a week or so I am doing it,Suicidal
7725,7745,I cried for the first time in years the summer class i depended on told me i was not eligible and i could not follow the course anymore after two weeks of learning i enjoyed. My school functions on a modular system which is extremely flawed towards students with undiagnosed ADHD and little autonomy. I love learning but my school does not have teachers we have modules 60130 pages of selflearning. This system where students advance at their own pace is a nightmare for people with un medicated ADHD like me. In part to why i loved my summer class so much was because the teacher would talk to you and guide you through the subject. I wish i had changed schools earlier in my highschool career its too late for all that. Being a maximum one year behind was my goal and i would have reached it if i had finished 8th grade science when i was 14. In 9th grade they removed my science and social studies subjects to focus on the more important ones same for 10th grade. Why would they do this if you need them to graduate? I have planned suicide this whole year delaying it with the thought that if i finish this summer class i will only have to do two years in one. My second option now gone I have never been closer to sneaking out and jumping off an abandoned parking lot nearby. I have hit a dead end. I will not graduate and I will not go to college. i will be 16 doing 8th grade science. putting me 3 years behind.,Suicidal
7735,7755,I am thinking about trying again in 5 days or so uni is going to come back during COVID so I have until then to die.

7748,7768,My therapist convinced me to get rid of my last one a couple months ago. Fool me once but not again. Its going to be a relief to have my rope again for when the time seems appropriate to follow through with my plan. Rewriting my notes again soon too. Made sure they are genuine heartfelt and apologetic in my drafts. Ordered another rope,Suicidal

7819,7839,I am suicidal. i want to die and i want to give up. I am desperately clinging on to the last thread. there is still so much i want to experience in life but i do not have enough motivation to go on any longer. i do not want to go before my mother. and i want just one person to listen to my story and tell me I have worked hard. i want to know from a professional stance if I am being too weak or if anyone in my shoes would have done better than i did. would it be safe for me to go to therapy and be honest about my suicidal thoughts without the risk of being sent to a mental hospital against my will? last ditch effort therapy?,Suicidal
7870,7890,I just cannot anymore. Its not worth it. Everything is so bad I am not even going to wait until my 18th bday. I feel like I cannot tell anyone. I am not in high school anymore I am not going to college my therapist ghosted me it is not worth fighting anymore. This is it. I cannot anymore,Suicidal
7876,7896,hello I just wanted to say that i want to kill myself before school starts which is august 15th but i think i need to double check that. I am going through a nasty breakup i really loved her but she did not feel the same way sadly. my friends do not talk to me anymore I am just a burden to them. I am not sure how I am going to be able to kill myself i just hope i can find a way to do it. i can just tell school is going to be rough for me and i just do not want to do it. i have nothing going for me at the moment.not even sure if i want to do this but I will see how I am feeling tommorow when i wake up and i hope I will be deleting this post i want to kill myself before school starts,Suicidal
7889,7909,I go to a clinic and get psych meds see a psychiatrist and a therapist. The therapist only does talk therapy and avoids major things that have impacted me like the sexual abuse I suffered as a child various other traumas the bullying. Just ask me about the week and never really offers anything helpful. This has been every therapist I have went to that Medicare covers. what is the point of more therapy and what is the point of this hellish existence. I ready to move on now. I no longer care. Real therapy cost money I do not have? what is the point?,Suicidal
7893,7913,I do not want to die but i want to live even less so the best option i have is to end this i think. I am just a bit worried about my girlfriend and what will happen to her I just want it to stop,Suicidal
7898,7918,i broke up with my gf bc i hate myself so much and i was constantly stressed about trying to make sure she could not tell that i was fucking miserable. i have a hard time telling the truth about how bad i need to kill myself and how awful i feel all the fucking time bc nobody wants to hear this traumatizing shit irl and nobody can tell that I am depressed anyway. she did not make me happy but nothing makes me happy lmfao. my psych thinks there is nothing wrong and I am sick of gaslighting myself and feeling insane and hopeless so I am finally ticking things off my plan. breaking up with her was always one of the last things on my list of things to take care of before i finally attempt. anybody else just feel fucking insane?? i cannot even believe myself at this point. everybody thinks I am fine so why do i feel so fucked up nobody thinks there is anything wrong so i must be crazy,Suicidal
7936,7956,I just cannot anymore I am getting really close to ending it all my parents are going away in a few days and once I am alone then that be the time I say goodbye to this world. I am going to say goodbye to everyone very soon.,Suicidal
7941,7961,what should i do when i feel so down so useless and so uneeded. i feel like no one would miss me when i die because i am irrelevant. i want to be stabbed to death like everyone in fear street. fear street,Suicidal
7961,7981,I do not think anyone or anything can stop me. I no longer have any reason to live. Even my future is certain. I am really depressed my grades are declining and not a single person enjoys being around me or having anything to do with me. I am currently planning what the most painless way will be. Any suggestions? And do not try to say do not kill yourself there is help out there. I have seeker help and it did not work at all. I am miserable and just want to end this shit. What would the least painful way be? I have decided to kill myself,Suicidal
7995,8015,but I have tried every imaginable means to get over it for so long to no avail. I still cannot convince myself that I can live without a life partner. Every fleeting conversation with a woman gives me hope that is immediately dashed. Every time I hear other people setting each other up I want to jump in front of a train. I even try to stay home and avoid women as much as possible but that leads to other things that remind me of them.there is just no way out of this. I cannot even kill myself because there is always the carrot of tomorrow maybe tomorrow I will meet the one but deep down I know there is no hope I cannot compete with other dudes. I have accepted as fact that I will never marry,Suicidal
8057,8077,No one love me anymore. that is all I am now unloved forever Worth it,Suicidal
8068,8088,I am just so tired of living everything is just soapathetic almost gray if that makes sense idk.I have isolated myself from all my friends i just sit around all day and be a waste of space to my family my bf is probably bored of me what have i actually contributed to this world ??? literally nothing.I am useless waste of everyone is time and money I am nothing i do not matter nothing matters anymore nothing matters.,Suicidal
8084,8104,For a while everythings been ideation mostly it still is but the ideas are becoming real. A plan is forming in my head. Details to be decided. Obstacles to circumvent. An idea has taken hold. Finally forming a plan,Suicidal
8116,8136,26 and I lost my best friend of 15 years. He was the only person I thought cared about me. My ex cheated on me with him and he chose her. She was my first real girlfriend and I put so much into her. Now I have to think about how they are having a wonderful time together and I am completely alone. No one will care when I am gone. I have zero impact on any of the lives I am a part of. Everyone just tolerates me until a replacement shows up. No one will care when I am gone,Suicidal
8135,8155,I am moving on. I cannot forgive them so Ill just pretend they are dead or never even existed. All pictures of them in my phone deleted my social media deleted. Its not healthy to hold a grudge this long. If I am already suicidal why not just TRY to have a better life? Nothing to lose. Should just take the chanceif nothing matters in the end. Ill become a new person and meet new people. Worst case scenario I fail but still learn and get the experience. And yes I am going through withdrawals rn. Instead of killing myself Ill kill them in my head,Suicidal
8139,8159,Its been on my mind for a few years now but now I have wanted to end this life of mine. I have had 2 relationships both more than 7years end. I cannot take this pain anymore. I am in a country far away from family. I do not want to go back to my family because I have failed in every single way. I am scared and alone. I just want this pain to stop. I have tried to look up many pro suicide forums but can not find any. As I sit here alone no friend in my life losing the love of my life. I just need my life to end. I want it to end. I cannot take this pain its all my fault. Ending life is my peace,Suicidal
8150,8170,If I did not live with my dad I would feel better about offing myself. The only reason why I have not attempted yet is because I do not want him to find me before I die. I do not want to risk being severely brain damaged. I wish I lived alone so it would be easier to hang myself.,Suicidal
8151,8171,i let this happen i should not have and now I am fucking Paying for it i need this to stop i swear to god I am going to kill myself before the date i gave myself. i feel so unbelievably guilty every single day my body gets worse and i my brain is just on slow mode or some shit help me i am a horrible person,Suicidal
8183,8203,I am going through a huge rough patch right now and I know it will get somewhat better eventually. But the parts of my life where I am somewhat happy are so few and far between. It never feels like good times will last. Is living a life where 90 of it is pain and 10 is good really worth it? The good times are not worth waiting for.,Suicidal
8190,8210,There is nothing left for me to do. Nothing really ever excited me. Nothing makes me happy. cannot stand school it is too hard. cannot get a job. I have let anxiety consume me and control me. I cannot go back. I am an addict. I have no dreams. What I crave is really simple. I just want to be dead. Being alive is painful. I have no loved ones no one by my side. I am no ones first pick. On top of that I am ugly. I am also really stupid. I do not have motivation at all. I never had a role model. I am bored of life. it is just not for me. Feels like my time is done here,Suicidal
8226,8246,I have been suicidal since age 12 after my mother passed away. It hit me so hard I have never felt like life had robbed me more than in that moment. More importantly I felt like life had robbed her. But she did not choose to die. She ended her suffering.But here I am in a perfectly healthy body and what seems like a fortunate life and yet I want to end it. I have gone through most of my life just waiting for something to push me over the edge so that I can finally die. But unfortunately I am still here. And even worse is that I have done nothing of value or meaning. I have wasted my time and missed out on opportunities with friends.. I have not been living. I have been waiting for death. I feel so useless and empty that I do not have a goal or a plan or anything. I am just kind of floating through life without direction and I do not know how to handle that realization anymore. You know what is worse than dying? Going through life thinking you are going to end it all anyway so what is the point in trying?,Suicidal
8283,8303,God help me I just cut myself its not too big but its just got me thinking is living even worth it? We just keep working for what? Our future? God I am such a useless idiot I cannot contribute to anything god help me Damnit,Suicidal
8298,8318,At the beginning of last year I was employed married had great credit had an apartment a car and a computer for entertainment. Events that followed1. My wife let the insurance lap on our car and I got ticketed after being crashed into.2. This happened right after I came out as trans. 3. Wife could not and would not take me to physical therapy.4. Out of work because I have to be according to doctor and lawyer. 5. Lawyer tell me I cannot move forward with lawsuit until I get medical bills and tests which I cannot get to or pay for.6. Wife aborts planned child because I am trans while out at work.7. My job fires me because I cannot come into work because wifes car is totalled and I was a driver8. In moment of distress and grief I try to kill myself.9. I got baker acted in the hospital and not allowed to have phone or connection to outside.10. While I am inside the hospital against my will for a month my wife refused to pay any of my bills forfeited our apartment threw away everything that I owned including multi thousand dollar computer and trashed my truck.11. Wife withdrew all money from my bank accounts and police and bank say its legal because she had my pin.So now I am homeless Transportationless moneyless clotheless and with no credit.It seems like everyone here would tell me that things will get better I just need to sleep on a couch or at a homeless shelter and put inordinate amounts of effort into building my life back up to less than what I started with even though I have a shit ton of mental health issues not being treated that make it nearly impossible to keep putting in effort.People will carelessly tell me to go get help at places that I cannot get to reliably or tell me to do this or that even though they do not have to do those things themselves.I cannot even reliably get a job because of my credit and lack of Transportation in the USA.I am constantly in a loop of being at my lowest and I need a fucking handout and I cannot even say that without people thinking I am greedy or entitled to money I did not earn but I am also stuck not being able to earn any money. I do not have internet and I will not even have the phone I am typing this on soon.Does anyone have any recommendations that will actually help me other than just telling me to keep going?I am really getting sick of being at such a low point and truly think of nonexistence as being so much better.I have no friends and no family. I am alone. I hate that society is hypocritical and careless about suicide prevention.,Suicidal
8301,8321,Hi. So a bit of background.My dad is 54 years old and has been married to my mum for 30 years. When my mum had me 21 she developed postpartum depression which lead to psychotic depression and according to him this has essentially changed her and unfortunately has lead to a somewhat unhappy marriage although things have recently been stabilised in terms of any arguments. My mum has also suffered abuse as a child and multiple different traumas which has lead to her being very underdeveloped cognitively and intellectually which on top of the depression results in her being unable to properly look after herself. This is why my dad has never divorced hes never said it outright but I reckon the only reason he stays is because of the sense of obligation.His relationship with me as a child used to be good but it was always tainted with his anger. He would shout at me for spilling juice or for asking for magazinestoys or just for nothing if work had been bad. Essentially as I grew up I became more frustrated with his anger and started shouting back as a teenager does. He took this to mean his anger should not be restricted then. One time when I was 14 I went to the wrong street for him to pick me up one street over and as soon as I got in the car he started driving as bit hit the brakes then screamed in my face I HATE YOU I FUCKING HATE YOU. He would always apologise after but it felt like walking on eggshells always. I have not had anything like that recently with him but I do not know if that is because hes better or there is more distance between us in our relationship. Overall I very much get the impression that he feels trapped by my mother and I that he wishes life could have been different.He has his mum and dad but his anger has caused their relationships to be strained. He has maybe three friends? But he only sees them at work.I have suspect this has caused him to be depressed bear in mind hes never claimed to be outright depressed. For a while now hes talked about death and he hopes he dies soon. My mother was on holiday with him last year and told me that she found him weeping in the shower and after that he tried to leave the apartment naked mental breakdown? but he was fine the next day. I did not say anything because I was scared terrified of what he would say if confronted about it. The only person I would ask about stuff like this is my dad but that is not an option. My mother is in no state of mind to handle this so it falls on me.Tonight he said to me that we had to talk about what I should do when he dies get everything in order. I said to him no let us not because you are not going to die for a good while to which he responded with you will be lucky if I am here next week. He then reminded me before going to bed about this talk were to have. I am terrified. I think hes going to do it. I love him so much please help me here. I do not know how to help him. I do not even know if I am overreacting or what. What should I do. I think my Dad might kill himself,Suicidal
8342,8362,Max 5 months left to live.cannot see me past that and the thought of staying alive makes my heart rate skyrocket and my head turn It has to be this year,Suicidal
8366,8386,The urge to kill me has increased a lot today it is unbearable to live. The food tastes weird it is like I do not feel the taste of it I have to put ketchup in every meal to become more edible. Talking with other human beings too hard I am not shy but I find it very tiring to talk and interact with others. Today right at the moment when I write this I no longer want anything I no longer have dreams or desires nothing else causes any kind of emotion in me I just feel the pain and the empty. I really want to die not to get rid of my problems but to be able to rest. I want to be able to rest,Suicidal
8372,8392,I think I am done. I am always angry I grew up living with an abusive father and right now things are constantly worst. I told my family that I am not feeling okay has thoughts of wanting to die a year ago and did not get any support. I am still a student so I have no money on my own to seek professional help. Still locked up in the house due to pandemic bad government in my country. Everyday is hell. My anger sometimes is poured to my pets. I hurt them and I think soon enough I will hurt people or maybe kill them. So yeah instead of doing another bad action which harms my pets I will just kill me. I want to be at peace already I am potentially dangerous. I think someday I will become a serial killer or anything bad. Might just kill myself before harming others,Suicidal
8386,8406,do not know what to call it but a person I go talk to and they give me advice and help me understand myself and my feelings better.I do not want to go. I am the one who wanted help but it causes me so much pressure. I feel like my problems are not enough big and that there are a lot of people who need the help over me. I do not take the advice she gives me and going there I just wait for it to be over. It makes me feel sad when she makes me think about my emotions. I am too tired to go not because lack of sleeping I have just had this weird issue of being too tired emotionally and not really able to do shit because of that do not know why and it is starting to feel useless to go because I keep most of the things inside of me and overthink. It would be so much easier to just stay at home and act happy. No one understands anyways. I cannot find a way to tell her I do not want to go anymore and at this point I feel like help is useless. It will not help anyways and I am not going to have any dreams for the future because I do not want to stay. I just want to have my last night of sleep last meal and last gaming session. And then end it all. That would be a thousand times easier and end the pain. I do not really mind dying because I have no dreams and I am just living my boring NPC life. It does not even feel sad to leave everything except friends and family. But I am sure that is not going to stop me if I really choose to end it all. I do not want to go to 'therapy' anymore,Suicidal
8399,8419,I want to kms as a means of avoidance. I am too tired for life and I am tired of having to run away from my own mind at 100 mph. I probably have ocd and my stupid meds do not fucking work I hate it they made me jittery like a shot of adrenaline and cloudy at the same time so I stopped taking them. That were my last hope. Its just kind of sad knowing that some people just get the short end of the stick and there is nothing you can do about it. And even sadder knowing that I am one of those people. I got a shit life and a shit brain that nobody understands. It all just makes life seem kind of empty and pointless. I am SO TIRED OF LIVING ON THE OUTSIDE OF MY BODY I cannot fucking do this anymore. It hurts even more having to see my moms face everyday finally happy and stable unknowing that I am going to put a bullet in my brain soon. I already got the gun My mom does not know that I am going to put a bullet in my brain soon,Suicidal
8406,8426,I am just done with everything I honestly have been feeling like I have no care to the world that is including my own life its hard to see any positives and I have felt super numbed down with emotions lately and just do not see the point of a lot of things that I just say fuck it who cares anymore. I feel like nothing and nobody,Suicidal
8411,8431,I am not scared of dying anymore I have reached the point of where nothing makes me happy. I should be happy going from inpatient to further treatment and now a job but I am not. I use to be deathly scared of dying and how it affects my family. I do not care anymore I am in so much emotional pain. I just do not want to keep going through the emotional anguish and trauma it hurts too much. I feel like a disappointment and failure to everyone. I feel like my depression has been masked for awhile and its just coming out full force wanting me to just end it. I wish you all the best in your similar struggles I am ready to go out,Suicidal
8414,8434,Hopefully my behaviour can help find out why. I tend to be very apathetic apart from when I am stuck into researching my favourite subject which is nutrition and have become very impatient with my former favourite hobby I engaged in to relieve boredom which are video games. I have some suicidal ideation because nutrition can only provide so much information and find it extremely difficult to start new hobbies like learning an instrument. I have so far failed to mention my autism which I inherited from my purely parental lineage and had diagnosed from a professional and autism has been linked with depression although I do doubt my diagnosis to a small degree. My heart rate is in the 90s which is a possible indicator that something is wrong with me since higher heart rates are linked with depression shorter life spans and a greater chance of CVD although I am exercising and eating some legumes to lower it as much as possible. I am taking lamogtrigine which is supposed to stabilize my mood as my consultant thinks that I may have Bipolar and I am growing some broccoli sprouts to treat my autism as it is the only shown treatment of autism there is if I even have it in the first place.I am whole food starch based but I understand if you do not want to leave animal products behind as my oldest sister still likes them.My main issue with making friends is anticipatory anxiety possibly induced by church up until we stopped attending much to the dismay of the pastors at 14 and maybe attending school at 14 after a history of only homeschooling. I am completely fine in the presence of others like at school and can tolerate them fairly well outside of regular social meetings but the main reward is walking out of the regular meetings for sure knowing I have some time before I encounter them again. Quickly going back to nutrition I think I might be deficient in both calcium and magnesium which seem to have a role in mood alongside the obvious ones being bones and muscles and I am also taking ashwaganda. My grandfather on my fathers side the autistic and very quiet one who only every talked to my mother once in his entire life thankfully it being the pleasant topic of his civil engineering career. He shook hands with the queen for an important construction project once despite being very middle class. I also have problems falling asleep at regular times but no issue getting it consistently. I must further mention that I have had severe seperation anxiety based on my mother to the point where I very rarely could be left with strangers and could not even be held by my own father who has suffered from general anxiety for as long as he can remember.I grew up in a Christian community and also a completely secular sailing club which gave me the feeling of being Jekyll and Hyde before having known about the book. But both feelings where equally enjoyable. Although I was in a Christian environment much more. This was balanced out by three and a half years of schooling I suppose although one of my friends at church who I do not see anymore thought religion was stupid and my mother and I think he could have been autistic. I keep in sparse contact with one friend from my Christianhood and none of the good friends I made in public school.And yet after all of my research into nutrition and other lifestyle changes such as aerobic fitness what could be the because of my low mood? Any supplements you guys would recommend as I am also taking boron which is a unessential mineral that boosts testosterone a fair amount among other things.Thanks for reading this long post. What could be causing my suicidal ideation?,Suicidal
8421,8441,I am a final year student about to enter the workforce. I come from a privileged background where I did not have to work part time to pay for my school fees and I live comfortably with my parents. I have a lot to be grateful for but I feel like there is nothing worth living for. I do not find satisfaction in friendships and whatever hobbies I like to do are swept aside as I am not very smart so I have to study all the time to be able to pass my exams. Even after school ends Ill be working a job and maybe then Ill be able to pursue my hobbies. I love my family but I hate being hounded by constant questioning about my life. Sometimes it gets too much and I rather be alone. I have no motivationgoal. I do not desire to be rich I am ok as long as I have a roof over my head. I know when the time comes to begin work I will go to work but I know that I will dread every day of it. there is no job for what I liked to do even so it would not make enough money to pay for rent. I feel so stuck and cannot figure what else is there to live for. I am mostly positive because I live day by day but if someone gave me a way to end my life I think I might take it. what is wrong with me? How can I change this selfish mindset and find more purpose in life? How do I make life worth living?,Suicidal
8458,8478,I cannot seem to enjoy anything anymore. Everything is boring and colorless even the things I used to love. All I can think about is how life is so hard. Why should I keep working for the rest of my life everyday nonstop just to do die in the end? I do not think life is worth living anymore. Those ideas are eating me everyday and I do not even have enough money to go to a therapist they are really expensive where I live. I am exhausted really really exhausted. I need help,Suicidal
8477,8497,My psychiatrist will not test me for ADHD despite the fact that I have sooooo many of the symptoms of inattentive ADHD in adult women. If I do not have it does that just mean I am stupid and incapable of taking care of myself for no reason? I would love to go see another doctor but I am about to lose my insurance August 1st because I no longer qualify with the job I got back in March. Despite the fact that I cannot pay for my chronic pancreatitis medication out of pocket even with this new job. The ironic thing is that I am probably going to lose this job because of how often I have to call off work with the illnesses that I need my insurance for. I do not know what to do anymore. I have been trapped in an endless cycle of quitting jobs and getting new ones because of my mental and physical health for years. And I am so so tired of fighting with my own brain and body to try to convince it just to fucking function normally so I can at least meet the bare minimum of societal requirements of yknow paying rent. I am really at the end of my rope. I feel like I have no options left. I want to kill myself just so I can stop being a burden to the people I love and so I can stop feeling so goddamn miserable all the time. If you have any suggestions I am all ears. Otherwise this might be my last post.TLDR I do not feel like I have any options left and I might just end things. I am so tired. Idk what to do anymore,Suicidal
8485,8505,So this is a post that I have been meaning to make for a while. I suppose you could call this an adjustment disorder. I realize now that the career I so loved is not going to work out for me.And it is too late to reasonably switch.I have been looking at the balcony recently more and more. There are people working outside so it would not be a good time to make the move now. What do I tell my family? My friends? Do I just say goodbye? Tell them how much I appreciated their love and kindness? There are days where I have felt good recently but it is fleeting. I have literally failed badly in the prior weeks due to this depression in my residency effectively closing the door on a subspecialty I think I would have enjoyed. Now I am stuck likely not going to get a job in an area or in a hospital that I will remotely enjoy. After a decade and a half of my life 1214 hour days and intense emotional stress. This is it.I supposed I should be grateful. I do have a loving family. A loving girlfriend. My best friend lives in Vancouver he checks in from time to time. My sister recently visited and it was very nice seeing her.I did a trial of therapy. She gave me breathing exercises and some CBT to help cope with these negative thoughts. However at the end of the day none of that is going to change the situation I am in. I could have had so much more. I will always think that in the back of my mind at work. I know this about myself. it is going to drive me crazy. I gave up so much to be where I am at today. I supposed this is a spoiled comparative mindset that is truly unhealthy. I should be glad to be making a top income in the US. I have the ability to subspecialize and impact people's lives in a nice way. But I fucked up. Royally.This is not a goodbye. I know I will likely not end it today. But I will give it a few months I do not see this lasting long for me. Probably not a good idea to post this to my main account so I will move this to my throwaway from years ago.Thanks for reading. I have not felt anything positive in a long time. Feels like there is a weight attached to my eyelids and it is hard to truly FEEL. I love my girlfriend I love my family my dog my friends. I truly do. But I cannot feel it. I cannot feel anything in the past few weeks to months. it is hard to keep going like this. physician suicide,Suicidal
8488,8508,everybody is temporary I am so numbnothing is actually wrong at the momentbut i always find something to be sad about.I am still obsessing over a guy i met online 8 months ago n we have not even talked in 4 months.i do not even want to be in a relationship because if i get attached they will hurt me and leave.but i do not want to be alone.life seems so hopeless.i do not feel enough.i just want to go back to nothing.wish i never existed.i do not have anybody.yet I am still suffering.what can i do?????? i really do not want to exist so alone,Suicidal
8519,8539,I am just waiting that someone texts me so i do not need to kill myself. Letter is written and everything prepared.. Waiting,Suicidal
8521,8541,i have schizophrenia and i feel very isolated. i have been reading the stories in this reddit thing and it makes me sad but also relieves me that there are plenty others who feel that their time is near. this may sound a bit morbid but maybe sometimes we do not need to live. maybe we do not have a choice if we are born but we should have a choice to end it if we so desire. trouble is that if the attempt does not work you are at risk of being institutionalized. and the truth is those facilities or at least the ones I have been in are far from therapeutic. i wish i could be a normal person with a normal brain who does not think of dying and the ways in which to do so almost if not all day. is there anyone who feels the same? i find myself to be cowardly nowadays when it comes down to doing what i need to do. i think that is because i have attempted and failed so many times. anyway i hope this message reaches somebody out there. thanks. hi i just wanted to say something,Suicidal
8539,8559,I am 18 and lost a Binance account with thousands of dollar in it and cannot recover it I do not even feel comfortable home when all my dad talks to me about is the account. I really have no clue as to what to do I already told him I cannot recover tried with their customer support hundreds of time probably by now and nothing. Me being a US User and Binance being banned here does not help neither. But yea there is no way I can recover all that money in a short time. What can I do?,Suicidal

My family is a reck my brother has some unknown illness he can literally only eat 10 things at max my mums struggling with body image and is trying her best to help us. I wish i could tell her everything. around 2 years ago i started isolating myself from the small group of friends i had one by one i distanced myself till no contact with them i do not even know the reason why the thing that is destroyed me most is breaking up with this guy i was head over heels for. I gave him no reason and just blocked him i still see him out in public rarely and have a full on panic attack after. I have no friends I am homeschooled because school have me extreme anxiety.. i really cannot do it anymore I am scared to die but i know i cannot do this for much longer.

8597,8617,So something amazing happened yesterday! A job opportunity basically just sprang up into my face. I completed two back to back phone interviews with the owner and manager then boy the next thing i know we are talking about start dates and pay and...I am terrified? I should be thrilled. How lucky am I that this happened? I should be jumping for joy because I desperately need a job have not worked in a year due to covid and this could be a great fit for me. But all i keep coming back to is how much I want to die. How anxious at failing i am. How depressed i am. How incapable I am. How I have walked this road before gotten a cool job dealt with the stress for a few days and then broke under the weight of constant suicidal ideation. Its a pattern I and the others in my life recognize. To the point that everyone I tell when getting the news mentions that oh well I am sure you can handle it this time This time...But I am so afraid. I am so depressed. I just want to close my eyes and never open them again. But i know i need this job. Please. Help... Self sabotage please help,Suicidal
8621,8641,I do not have any serious problems. I have my family I have friends I am not poor or disabled and I have a good life but I just think death may be way better than lifeJust an empty void where you cannot feel or think anything. No pain no sadness no thoughts... It just seems perfect. And life seems to only long and boring. I am sorry for my bad english I am spanish I do not know what is happening,Suicidal
8634,8654,Had a post like this a while ago I think I deleted it. I am going to be gone later this week. Thanks for all the support from this subreddit but nothing can stop my abusive sister lousy parents and all the shit I put with before.Goodbye Goodbye for the second time,Suicidal
8658,8678,If I would overcome my fears and stepout of my comfort zone and finally go to therapy then what? What should I tell them? That I do drugs? That I earn money illegally? I do not sell drugs What are they going to do? Lock me in the psychatry or prison? Or even both??? And what should I say what my next move is? To be honest my next move is not going to university or doing something normal its doing more drugs harder drugs to escape reality. I cannot do this anymore I did not do drugs for 3 days and I am beyond miserable Going to therapy and saying what?,Suicidal
8725,8745,Like please shut up. You do not know what someone is going through or their mental state or their circumstances. Just because you do not think something is the end of the world does not mean that is the case for other people. I hate when people say Its not the end of the world.,Suicidal

8734,8754,wish I could send pictures for literal proof but this girl is my friend and she is threatening to kill herself and I literally took screenshots but I cannot send any here. I want to help but I am a fucking loser pussy who cannot tell her family members because it will destroy them. I want to help and I do not know what to do. I am literally scared and need help. I want her to live her life I want her to be safe but I do not know how to tell others. she will be mad at me. I just want her to know that she matters and that everyone loves her.

But i am not self harming or putting a rope to my throat. Does anyone know good copping mechanisms or breathing exercises that can help? I am having intrusive thoughts,Suicidal
8807,8827,Knowing that if it does not kill me and I cannot be quiet enough to stomach the pain Ill probably be left with organ damage and that it can take hours to kill you from what I have read holds me back from doing it. I wish there was just an easy 100 guaranteed way in under a minute that I could have access to I am sure most on this sub feel that way too unfortunately Bleach vent,Suicidal
8821,8841,I think I just threw up because of anxiety again and it is been almost a year if not a year and a half sense I have thrown up over him and I just did it tonight I am at his house rn because family life is bad but I am going home tomorrow and I do not want to leave him but I know I have to so I can get better and I know now that if I die because of him he will not care but it is ok because that is just how life is cruel and unpredictable It has to do with the ex I was talking about in my last post,Suicidal

8828,8848,It happened last night. We were both in the US ARMY. She went to the bases behavioral health due to problems in her marriage. From there she was referred to the same program that I was in I graduated a bit before she would have. While I was there I would often talk to her about problems in her marriage. Her wife had left her and moved back home leaving her alone. She seemed like she was doing so well and coping. I felt comfortable that she would do fine without me there. And today I found out that she killed herself. I do not know how to feel. Sad? Angry? I feel like I failed my friend all she needed was someone to love and care for her. I could have given her that. Its got me thinking about my own life and if its worth it to keep going. My friend just killed herself,Suicidal
8871,8891,I am thinking about relapsing in self harm Relapse,Suicidal
8940,8960,I was heavily considering killing myself in December 2019 and honestly the idea was never completely out of my head prior to that either. I wish I did. I wish every single day that I did.Things were finally getting better and I had just received a handful of amazing onceinalifetime opportunities the week before the pandemic officially started a you.S. lockdown. I had one week. Just one week that I did not think about dying every single morning and every single night.Everything has been hell. I lost my apartment and had to move home because the person I moved in with went absolutely insane and had a total breakdown and started aggressively forcing me to live by her conspiracy theory rules. Covid is spread via the sidewalk covid is spread via open windows in the air two stories up the windows needed to be boarded up never once leaving the apartment in a year etc.Covid is a completely different experience for those who have significant others and a stable living situation. I had neither. I tried so hard to go on dating sites so I would not be completely alone. But people would lovebomb me and then when I was invested they would start being abusive and degrading and cruel. I gave up.It feels like women genuinely do not care about anything other than their boyfriends no matter how progressive or new age they are. All of my female friends revolved their entire lives around their boyfriends since the pandemic started and honestly before that too.I hate being home. I despise it. But I social distanced as much as possible. I was guilted or shamed by people for going out and guilted and shamed by people for staying in. It felt like all my female friends would always justify that they constantly visited their boyfriends or spent all their time with their boyfriends. But if I ever saw a friend once a month it was frowned upon.Why? Why is it so taboo and wrong for me to be social just because it was not with someone who I was fucking.My friends all made me realize that it is impossible to ever get structure unless I somehow manage to find a significant other. But I have tried so hard to date and almost every time has been a traumatic experience.I am so jealous of them. I hate them. I do not want to hate my friends. But I feel so angry. I feel so misunderstood. Absolutely NONE of the people who judged me would ever go through what I went through.I moved back home with my parents from a huge city to a town with 800 people. My parents I love very much but they are both abusive. I did not have a choice. I had to leave my apartment because my roommate had stopped working and paying rent. I would have had to pay the entire 2 bedroom rent if I stayed.I feel like a burden. I wish I had just died. there is no place for me in this world. I have not been happy in two years. I lost everything. I will never have a life that is rewarded in a pandemic. I am not meant to be happy ampx200Bampx200BI will only ever destroy my life and I do not deserve happiness I wish I killed myself before the pandemic,Suicidal
8946,8966,that is it. the lonely life when you cannot count and trust on anyone,Suicidal
8953,8973,I am 18 soon 19 andwondering why not save up some cash and go to a obscure place to end it. Have one last blast before I go. Or in my case firstone day to live. Were I do it all the drugs I was to cowardice to try. Or perhaps do some street racing maybe hunt down some bastards in my past and ask theme why why were you such an asshole. Kill theme with kindness but I digress. My whole life up to 18 was boring? wasted?. And know I am close to 19 trying to get into art. Well obviously I am awful I could have started years earlierbeen happyAlas I feel this is the finale thing to push me. Ill never be happy doing anything else. Art is my passion yet I wasted 18 years gaming. Too little to late I guess. No fucking good artist started at 18. Even vangough drew when he was young for some reason hes always an example of a late bloomer. I want to join the military kill or be killed. I feel its were useless dregs like me belong. I take out my anger and lack of self care on terrorist whatever that means and maybe Ill die but when I die Ill be a heroinstead of a coward. I think its for the best I am an disgusting creature. I wanted to be a artist be happy do paintings write weird meta physical fantasy novels and sculpt my muses. But I am a fucking useless moron. I feel like life carved a path of destruction for me to follow die in a bloody useless war. I hate my life and honestly think Ill die at 20. 18 fucking years gone and what do I have to show for it. You know I have fantasy of a world were I never lived this life. A life were I am not even human nor are my companions. I cannot quite explain it but me and my fellow aliens are happy and I had decent parents. I want to strip myself of my disgusting flesh. Inject myself with pain killers and adrenaline. Then strip myself cleanof this disgusting curse. Finally I pull the trigger and die clean. Ill finally be happy with my people. Oh Ill be a wonder to theme but will be one in another. 100 percent of my disgusting humane dna gone. Why should I not kill myself at 20?,Suicidal
8985,9005,that is it. should i even care anymore? ILL FUCKING DIE HAPPILY IF THEY WANT ME TO! and after everything i have sacrificed and done for them they call ME the asshole. i cannot believe it! that is fucking it! I have lost my mind! I am going insane! i do not think I have genuinely been THIS mad at anybody for a very long time. I am going to fucking kill myself! my friend just unfriended me for being trans after i pussied out of suicide THREE TIMES for them,Suicidal
8990,9010,So like if you OD on drugs or some shit but you do not fully die will they eventually pull the plug on you at the hospital or will they do what most humans opt to do and make you suffer via keeping you as a vegetable. I know that it usually comes down to money so if those who are conscious refuse to pay will the hospital just let me die and send my corpse to the morgue? This is a genuine question. And mods please do not ban me or remove this post. I have heard stories that any posts that get too real get removed real fast. Are you likely to end up a veggie in a hospital?,Suicidal
9029,9049,I am only alive because of my sibling. They have already lost both parents to suicide. Its so selfish of me to want to end things too but I am so miserable and everything I try just makes things worse. I try things out of panic and it does not work then I just feel more hopeless. Tomorrow I am going to where my mother passed away to just think about things. I am not going to do it yet but its rough. I cannot take it much longer,Suicidal
9037,9057,I hate this world. Nothing good ever happens to me. I am so miserable. Fuck.It is really hard to see reasons to stay alive. I do not think i will ever escape my misery. Death would free me from all the pain i have. Fuck this World,Suicidal
9054,9074,I have been so lucky to work at a job I love for many years. I have been lucky to keep my job even though the pandemic I have sort of got a promotion and a wonderful chance to learn new things. Interacting with my coworkers instantly makes me want to go home and figure out a way to stop existing.They are not loudly toxic I imagine that its a normal amount of passive aggressive backstabbing and bullshit. The one lady who sits next to me is nice and superficially friendly mothering sort. Who makes passive aggressive comments about me to the women at the other desk while I can hear her and has been putting an anchor on the things she is supposed to be showing me. I feel trapped. I have only gotten a few hours of sleep. I just do not want to do life anymore. Interacting with my coworkers makes me suicidal,Suicidal
9155,9175,I feel burnt out. I like being by myself but I still feel envious of people with good connections to other people. I have no energy but caffeine gives me anxiety. I actually try to actively change things in my life by being more active and I want you to know that exercise and being more social does help. it is just a little difficult to undo 8 years of depression. It feels like it is a part of my personality now if I am honest and I do not think I would recognise myself without it.it is overwhelming thinking about how much I need to work in the future. I feel empty all the time. I just want to stop thinking. I tried counselling. It got annoying after some time as I was hoping for more insight to help me but most of the time she just asks what I want to do. it is always the same followup question. It gets repetitive and does not feel like I am getting much value from it all the time. Maybe I just had the wrong expectations? Has anyone found counselling helpful?I have had medications too. It stops me from feeling intense sadness which helped but I did not feel happy just a void numbness. I am just tired to be honest. What helps me keep going is just taking this life as an experience and not too serious. it is easier said then done though as I still cannot help but consider how other people think. I come from an asian family and I do not want to bring shame to them but living in a western country I cannot help but dream of the freedoms my peers have. The only thing that keeps me going is that I am going to die anyway,Suicidal
9175,9195,will it ever get better its getting bad again,Suicidal
9209,9229,I am too much of a coward probably to go through with it but I am honestly done. Everyday I wake up with intrusive thoughts racing through my head that make me anxious. I have no one to talk to who will truly understand. I tried talking to my parents and while my dad is understanding and listens he has this tic rubbing and licking his nose that is extremely annoying and makes it almost unbearable to talk to him. He always takes it lightly and does not fucking change. When I try to sleep or even masturbate this is what is on my fucking mind for some reason stupid brain keeps replaying all the shitty sounds he makes. He also interrupts me a lot anyway and while I know he loves me I just cannot deal with this anymore. I have told my mom about this and she keeps saying all the stay positive bullshit do not go on social media and all that. she is probably right about the latter but it is gotten to a point where I cannot change. She makes fun of me for crying and feeling low all the time I guess it would make sense since I am in my early 20s and I should move past being so damn sensitive. I have friends that say they are there for me but I feel like they will choose their family over me anyway. I am starting to hate being an only child even though growing up I never had an issue with it. I was a happy liveinthemoment kind of girl. I have told them about my feelings regarding this but no matter how much reassurance I get I cannot help but feel this based on what I have seen in reddit. I hate the fact I have turned into this monster who is so needy for other people's company. I used to have so many fun hobbies to keep me busy but now I feel like I am lacking a meaningful connection with the people around me so nothing compensates.I am not comfortable being alone but I am not comfortable being around people anymore either. I used to be really confident and lively but now..I do not know. I do not see my life getting better. I have even stopped enjoying hanging out with my friends in general so I am in a loselose situation no matter what. I do not even know if I have a right to feel suicidal. I have a fulltime software engineering job I am in good physical health and I have plans to go to grad school. Through college I thought that if I work hard I can enjoy later. I never went to parties drank smoked through my four years. But none of that matters. When my mom or dad bring up something even vaguely sad or deep my eyes already start to tear up. I hate myself for being like this. I was not like this before the quarantine but oh well guess the damage is permanent. I do not see myself recovering from this situation.I can already see my life ahead of meperhaps getting married at 25 and popping out babies by the time I am 30. I feel so..useless. I think people will move past my death pretty quickly anyway. I am becoming some kind of hermit and passiveaggress freak anyway so I do not want to hurt anymore people before I die. With that being said what is the best way to kill myself? I was wondering if there was a painless way to do it. I might be doing that down the line do not see a point in living a meaningless lonely life anyway. Best way to die?,Suicidal
9212,9232,Weird vent idk I am confused .Ill probably sound dumb but everything made sense when I was homeless and addicted it was scary and painful but it made sense to me I knew what to do even if all I knew was just hiding my pain and hoping to die but now that everything is meant to be finally coming together in my life I do not think I am happy still . Its stupid I have been miserable for years but this feels different I used to hate myself because I did not look right or fit in or get social settings and I flunked everything I tried and ended up just washed up high and being a waste of time . But now I know I should be happy ? But I am not . I got into to college I have supportive friends and even a bf I am moving into a new place soon I have got a job . But now more than ever I feel like I am just right back at the edge like I cannot cope with any of it . I do not even hate myself anymore I do not even dislike my self mostly but I have such fear and dread for every moment of every day every piece of expectation every every moment to come like my hearts palpitating at evening being awake . I am just not sure what to do or if I can even cope like I have thoughts all the times of just letting go again or disappearing or even ending myself because I just do not think I can do it ? Like even on meds from my doctor and I am still thinking like this . I am closed off like I cannot talk even if I wanted too and I desperately want to get out of this fear but I cannot and I am too scared of everyone around me even the people who love me to try and talk about it . Anyway I am rambling but I guess my point is if this is when its meant to be good ? And its just painful and scary to me even tho its the best I have ever had . Will I ever find peace ? Or will I just have to just keep pretending and struggling through it ? Its just whatever anything happens my mind always goes to the idea of jumping and being free . Fixing my life has left me more scared to be alive than ever before and I do not know if I can do it ? I just want it all to stop and I know I should not but I have occasionally started skipping meds so I can re self medicate on my own time and I have been hiding that too . Idk its dumb like I said . Anyway Ill not keep this up long as its a badly written embarrassing mess thanks for taking the time tho . Struggling still,Suicidal
9219,9239,mods I am sorry if this goes against the guidelines. I have failed in all aspects. i could not even kms properly. there is literally no reason to live. there is no reason to even be posting this actually. my parents do not care about me my siblings do not care about me i have no irl friends and I am pretty sure my online friends do not care about me either. why would they? there is literally nothing good about me. i do not even want a reason to live anymore. i do not want to get better. i want to die. my therapist is great. i appreciate him loads but getting better is so hard and it just does not feel worth it. and anyway what is the worst that can happen? i survive? with severe brain damage? i will not even be fucking aware. ill write dnr on the wall or something so they cannot do anything. i wish id done it ages ago. i cannot believe i actually thought things might improve. considering posting on rroastme so ill feel even worse and it will make me want to do it even more except i do not want to show my face because I am fucking ugly. either that or I am taking to twitter rand say something mildly controversial like spiders are not that bad. i know ill get attacked because last time i was on twitter over a year ago i said one thing what? and got death threats. i wish someone would just kill me. i hope i get hit by a car or fall onto train tracks or get pushed off a high bridge or get stabbed or get caught in a fire. its so unfair. and i do not want to hear bUt liFe is not fAiR. i know. everyone does. and its not helpful. its so unfair that some people do not want to die and yet die. I have got everything i need to go through with it i guess right now I am just looking for something. anything really good or bad i do not fucking care. i just want to fucking die,Suicidal
9250,9270,My fianc had given birth and I was in the room the doctor turns to me and looks confused he says can you get the father I say I am the father he shows me a black baby so as you can guess I am white German she is white american so I found out my fianc had cheated on me and the babys not mine like this and I want to die I created this account to see if anyone can help me The babys not mine,Suicidal
9291,9311,might just kill myself tonight D rapist boyfriend is leaving me rn,Suicidal
9297,9317,literally all the time i think about dying but its so hard to actually kill myself. there is a few bridges near me that are high enough but I am too young to drive. i do not want to cut myself i think that is too messy and is not consistent enough. Anyone have any advice? I do not really have friends and i see all these people having fun with their lives and hanging out everyday and all i think about is how little anything means bc everyone will die eventually so nothing you do matters. Even if you do something in your life that affects someone else in a good way you will never get to see it bc you will be dead. I really do not want to just keep living thru the same shit every day hoping it will get better. because either way I am still going to die. I just want it to be over. I really really want to die,Suicidal
9303,9323,Been cutting ties lately. Only the job left but I might fix that tomorrow.There is a road close by I could jump in front of a truck. I took some meassurments and calculated that the driver would not be able to stopp before impact. It would not be kind to the driver though. Might traumatize the poor fellow. Everything I see is an instrument begging to be used. But I cannot bring myself to do the deed. There is nothing left. I still feel pain when I try to hurt myself but not much else. No happiness. No sadness. Just done. The Descent,Suicidal
9324,9344,Y'aw mean? Sometimes I feel like I just want to deepthroat a gun,Suicidal
9333,9353,I am a 15 year old male and I have really really strict parents. I have little to no privacy whatsoever. My parents are constantly questioning me about my personal life as if its an interrogation. They always go through my messages to see if they find anything. On top of all this they rarely let me hang out with my friends and they have strict limits on when or when I cannot use my phone. I am only able to use it for about an hour a day and they also banned many social media apps on my phone including snapchat instagram etc. Reddit is not banned I guess because it counts as a news app. Anyways I recently moved to a new school and I have had a really hard time making friends. I have only made like one or two friends throughout the entire school year. I do not know if its my social skills or my lack of confidence or me not being able to use social media. I just cannot stand it anymore and I feel like its time for the end. What do I do at this point? What should I do,Suicidal
9361,9381,I have tried and tried and tried. I have blocked and unblocked. Cried and screamed. I have met new people tried to forget you in whatever way I can. I cannot. I cannot stop thinking about you all damn night and day. I cannot take this anymore. I am tired of feeling so depressed and sad all the time because you are not in my life. I do not want to be here alone anymore. I miss you so much. I made so many mistakes. I failed you. I failed you. I failed you. I failed you. I failed you I failed you I failed you I physically cannot get over you.,Suicidal

9503,9523,Off my anti depressants bc my ex works at the pharmacy. Broke up a month ago. Keep thinking about going to the train tracks. Suffering with ptsd depression and anxiety. People tell you to get help. I have been trying for over a year. Been to a few different doctors. All refer me to mental health professionals that are too busy to call me back or they do not even bother referring me bc the waiting list is too long. Also called the mental health line for my state referred me to another place that I called 4 times within a week and did not ever hear back. Getting so tired of trying and I do not have my ex for support. My only friend in this area sexually assaulted me when I was a kid I blocked it out until this year and it hit me hard when I remembered. I do not know what to do anymore. I cannot go on. I feel more and more weak every day. Off my meds break up after 8yrs. Lost. Family in a different state.,Suicidal

9625,9645,Wow. The suicide hotline put me on hold and eventually hung up on me,Suicidal
9646,9666,Doctors do not take me seriously doctors will not do anything. This is UK. I have literally told them before I have a plan and I am going to do it. They say ok please do not do that thank you. I feel so alone. This world is not for me I fit in no where. I cannot keep going. Have first counselling session ever today but he will cut me off because I guess he will say you need to see a doctor immediately. Then they will not do anything. No help is coming. Give it a few days. I think this time it will happen. Family think I am scum. No one takes me seriously. This is it. Why carry on when I will never have the nice things others get. BPD and aspergers what a joke. On the brink but no help available no one takes me seriously. No one wants to know.,Suicidal
9667,9687,I have an odd thing going on. I never have any motivation to do very much but now I am currently very suicidal and also motivated to follow through. Just out of hospital and wanting to do a better job of it next time I try. I do have people in my life to live for but I do not have any hope for the future. I think the people I love would be better off without me they just do not realise it but would when I died. I need help,Suicidal
9677,9697,I have been fantasising about my own suicide for a while now maybe 2 years I am 15. they used to be more like an idea in my head like in some weird dream world or in a fictional place or something. and the end felt figurative and it was just like falling asleep peacefully and never waking up.these days they are getting more and more realistic like in my bedroom with a bottle of pills i know where to get or carbon dioxide poisoning with the burner in the kitchen cupboard. the pain with ending my life is becoming more and more real and it keeps appearing in my dreams too.i have never meant to act on the fantasies but last night i felt really impulsive and something my friend said deeply disturbed me and i had a really strong urge to harm myself or run away from home or take a bunch of pills any pills. i think i had a panic attack and i calmed myself down by cutting but it was scary how strong the urges were.sorry just wanted to rant lifes being a bit rough. fantasies are getting more realistic,Suicidal
9688,9708,Yeah if hell exists I want to go there. Endless torture and suffering sounds like a good time for me compared to living. I want to be punished and relax in hell because I feel like a massive saggy sack of sit every day to everyone around me. Ill feel good knowing I am there being reprimanded. I want it so bad its starting to sound more enticing than trying to live without failing everyone when I am trying my hardest. I hope i go to hell,Suicidal
9697,9717,I am too fucking stupid to have a job. Literally everything on the skills and duties list of every job looks way too fucking hard for me. I already had a dumbass panic attack in front of a cashier years ago when I tried to work. it is not even the issue of trying or it being hard for me. it is the fact that I know coworkers will be talking shit because I am stupid or slow like that one job. Nobody gives a shit about anxiety disorders or trauma. it is too bad I give too much shits about what other people think. It suffocates me. Applied to a job after years between and proceeded to freak the fuck out,Suicidal
9736,9756,I do not know what to do. I think I will make it another few months. I have a few goals that I want to reach by the time I am 32 new place goal weight and shape few adventures I am going to do everything I can to make my goals happen. I going to make it the best year that I can so that on my next birthday my choice will be clear. Maybe this is my last year that I will be here. Maybe this is the start to something amazing. I honestly do not know. I love everyone in my life and I do not want them to be sad but if things do not work out I cannot stay. it is stupid but I do not want to grow old alone I know I joke about being the crazy old guy in the woods but I do not want that. I want a family with the person that I fall in love with. I want a house and a yard so I can watch my kids whether they are ours or adopted grow up and hopefully be the father I wish I had when I was little. I want to go on adventures with someone and be able to have those stupid little moments where you know you have each others back 100 or you look in that person's eyes and you know they love you. I feel like my chances are all but gone and I do not want to be here if they are. Whenever I hang out with my friends I feel like the creepy old guy. I feel like I am intruding on the fun that everyone is having and they keep me around because they feel bad. I have become socially awkward I cannot keep eye contact with people like I used to. I do not want to feel like this anymore. Idk if I am legit autistic or I have some sort of developmental issue in my brain because I have always had friends younger than me and maybe I am stupid or something and my brain is stunted so I cannot relate to people my age. I do not want to live a life where I am the dude always tagging along to friends events or camping trips alone. I feel broken. I know something is wrong with me and I do not know if I can fix it. Idk even how I was able to to trick my ex into being with me but I know why she cheated. It was me. I was not a good husband even though I tried and I do not think I will ever get another chance. I do not want to die alone but I think I might have to and it is better to do it earlier rather than waiting around till I am 35 or 40. it will give people time to forget about me. This is all stupid as fuck. It all comes down to being alone and my brain not being able to handle it. Maybe I am being punished for the horrible shit I have done whether it is a God or the universe or something else I really do not know. I just know I will not let myself live alone forever Opened up to a friend tonight. I am not okay and she knows that an is encouraging me to tell another friend so they can both help. I am trying to get better but my brain is telling me I am being manipulative and to just end it anyway. I only have a few friends my own age most are younger by 5 years,Suicidal

9848,9868,I wrote this on the bipolar reddit this morning. well now i do not want to exist. I cannot do what i want to do because i do not have the mental stability. I have nobody to talk to about this shit. I only have family. Well that is not enough anymoreI cannot succeed in school but i have to in order to not become homeless. I cannot get a job at 21 years old because I am too socially anxious. I am just worthless. I want to hire a hit man to kill myself or something. I just want to die but i do not have it in me. I feel like an attention whore. I am so drained I am looking up the same shit i used to at 14. I take xanax for anxiety and i wish it sedated me but it does not. No matter how much i take i feel the same. I have taken 16 mgs at once and its done nothing to me. I just want to feel nothing. I want to be out of everyone is life. I make people feel shitty and it fucking kills me. I feel like I am trying to crawl out of my skin.I have been taking 100mg seroquel for four days. I am in a weird situation right now and its really difficult to explain but I am going to try. My dad met someone on minecraft about ten years ago and long story short they hit it off became friends and started a business together. She lives in australia and we live in the US. she is married with a kid and she is been really nasty to my family. She is in control of every aspect of his life finances has camera with audio in the living room of his house they own it for air bnb together Gps on him and has tried to buy the love of my brothers and I. Well for a short period i lived in that house rent free which i appreciate. I got kicked out after a manic episode and have been exerting all my engergy trying to get back into that house and pay monthly rent instead. she is decided that she wanted to create a plan for success but its all under her terms. On day four of taking these meds i realized i do not want to live under her roof. If I am going to pay to live somewhere then it makes more sense to me to spend more on rent elsewhere due to the emotional turmoil she is put me through. I am 21 years old and I think that this is the end of the road for me to try and repair my dad and is relationship. He has let this woman that i just found out hes romantically involved with which to me makes everything far more twisted someone who has hurt his family so much. This devastated me so much. I want to know if this is me thinking for myself for once or an impulsive thing. I have had to live at the house i was r in for two months while she decides if i should be allowed back. The reason i was kicked out due to a manic episode was because i wanted to go to the hospital for inpatient because i had not gotten a wink of sleep in nearly a week. My dad started telling me how stupid that would be because of i went to the mental hospital she would just kick me out. Its so sick and i do not think i can be in my dads life. I am so damn tired of existing,Suicidal
9866,9886,I feel like such a failure in life. I hate where I am in life right now. I feel like such a burden to my family and friends. I have no one to talk to about anything. no one cares about me. No one loves me. People only talk to me when they need something from me. Everything I do is not good enough for anyone. I work hard I save money i got into a program at uni but nothing is good enough for anyone. I am always lacking. I try so hard to be happy and to be a good successful person but what is the point? Everything I do does not matter. No one looks for me or misses me. No one cares about me and asks me if I am doing okay. I am no one's favourite. If I end my life everything will be okay. They can live without me. My mom can finally have someone else to emotionally abuse. I am one less burden they will have. No one will miss me when I am gone. Everyone will just be sad for one day and then move on like nothing happened. If I kill myself it will be my fault and everyone will call me selfish. If I decide to live nothing will change. I will be stuck like this forever. I am tired. Honestly the only reason why I am still around is because of my dog lol... I am tired.,Suicidal
9874,9894,I went to hospital trying to admit myself with self harm. I got stitches and spoke to the first clinician there were no beds in the mental health ward so they wanted me to stay the night to try again the next day. I did. I spoke to another clinician the next day who no matter how many times I reiterated I was not safe going home sent home home again because of no beds. I get that but being such a danger can they not transfer hospitals?I cannot be alone because everytime I am I self harm. All I think about is overdosing. I was weaned off lexapro 20mg in 12 days and started on venlafexine 75mg which hospital added another 37.5mg too which is only on about dag 8 of now. I know it is likely the med swap I have got a long history of self harm and suicide attempts though and I am afraid. One side of my brain KNOWS I need to stay alive and I deserve to live and have a life but the other is screaming at me to just give up because even the health system could not deem me worthy of saving... I do not know what to do when I have already reached out to professionals family friends... all my history is looking up what meds to OD on and the amounts needed and the risk of failing or what damage they leave behind should I do fail.... how do I stop this it is so loud I am 27 swapping meds and the suicidal thoughts are overbaring.,Suicidal
9880,9900,At that point where I have absolutely exhausted every avenue of trying to get better.. nothing I mean nothing works. I thought about it really long and no one cares about me so I do not want to here that bs about oh your family is going to be so sad well they had the time to help me and refused. I am unloved unwanted and used up.. I really want to just go really fast and crash into a wall but I do not want to be a veggie for my whole life how fast would one have to crash into a wall at to forsure end my life? Today is the day I think by car,Suicidal
9887,9907,Ill preface this by saying I have seen numerous psychiatrists therapists G.P.s and have been through the wringer with my family doctor throwing antidepressantantianxiolytic prescriptions at me to see what sticks. Everything still feels the same no matter what med new routine holistic solution etc. I am exhausted of living. So in March of 2020 I attempted suicide. I lived alone in a nice apartment I locked the door to my suite flipped the security latch taped a handwritten DNR sign in my living room locked the door and I took an uncountable amount of Clobazam not Clonazepam different drug 100 Gravol pills and at least 50 nighttime Benadryl pills. I got into bed and listened to Strict Machine by Goldfrapp. Then a feeling Id never felt before I was done. I felt like Id finished life. It was so soothing. It also could have been the effects of the massive quantity of pills I took. My thengirlfriend called me and we have a fine conversation. This is where I black out. She tells me days after my failed suicide attempt what happened. I was completely coherent and then just stopped talking. This is when I passed out. Long story short too late I wake up two days later in intensive care. Tube in my throat to regulate breathing. Catheter definitely in. Guess my DNR did not work. My parents who live four hours away are sitting around me as I come to. Fast forward I convince everyone I am not crazy and they say maybe you should go to our psych ward and I said no I will get better care when I move back to the city. I was living in a small city at the time. I get back to my apartment. My parents stay with me. COVID breaks out. A postgrad program I am studying announces that classes are over. I move back to the big city in my parents basement. My degree is mailed to me. I keep having the same conversations with people. I keep doing the wrong things. I continue to comply with the Ministry of Transportation to get my drivers license back. They keep sending me different forms to get my doctor to sign. My depressionanxiety stays the same. Covid has made the world weird for years just days after my suicide attempt. Am in purgatory? So much violence greed and narcissism in the world like I have never seen before. Every day I work my jobs but money just comes and goes if Id never even made anything. Same conversations ad nauseam. Am in hell? Am I in Sartres No Exit? Most days I think I am in purgatory. Am I in purgatory? Am I in purgatory? Trigger Warning,Suicidal
9891,9911,i cannot kill myself because i cannot take away my parents child but then again the pressure they put on me makes me want to kill myself. its kind of hot and cold,Suicidal
9926,9946,I am sick of constantly having nightmares of the sexual abuse that happened to me. i can always remember it in vivid detail and it makes me sick to my stomach. i do not want to remember any of this anymore. i just want to die so bad so i do not have flashbacks and nightmares anymore. sick of reliving it all tw sa,Suicidal
9943,9963,I am tired I feel like shit 247. The older I get the worse things become. I am the youngest of 3. I am in my late 20s now and everyday is just as shitty as the next. People want nothing to do with me I am ugly every interaction I have has so much negativity towards it its ridiculous. I can just sense the awkwardness and how much someone wants nothing to do with me. People do not want to talk to me or look at me. It gets hard. It gets harder when you see how people treat others so differently. I mean your own parents do not like talking about you and in all honestly they wish you would just get the fuck away. Like I do not exist. I know everyone secretly hates me and it in all honestly it all comes down to appearance. If I did not get trapped with the worst fkn genetics life would be soDifferent. I would kill to be either one of my brothers. Life is just natural for them they have friends and no constant reminder of how unwanted they are by society and any one for that matter. Like everyone has a general understanding of their own self awareness and where they stand among others. Like my own self is such ass. I am not lovable. I also have an underlying body infection that I believe has messed with my mental and physical health severely. However I think about to high school and college days and I have always been a loserloner since I can remember and its all because of the negative feedback I feel from others like it sucks. Its to the point now that if I kill myself now no one will bat an eye. I just cannot go on anymore,Suicidal
9944,9964,Only a couple months away everything is planned Ill be killing myself by asphyxiation with nitrous. There is nothing you or anyone else can do to help me. I be killing myself on my birthday.,Suicidal
9952,9972,I get these brief 5 seconds of motivation and hope I can be like everyone else stable and successful. Then my brain brings me back to reality and reminds me of how I cannot. Every time I go to apply for jobs on Indeed or try to write down some sort of plan for the future I just cannot do it. I physically feel nauseous thinking of having to be strong and try everyday. I want it all to end now. I do not want to build something for myself I do not want to be successful. I just want to be air or a cloud. I do not like being human. Every time I have cared about someone I lose them because I can become obsessive. My first crush landed me in the psych ward for 2 weeks because he did not like me back. that is what waiting for me whenever I catch feelings again. I cannot take this pain and I wish not to feel it. The bad significantly outweighs the good. I do not want to try anymore.,Suicidal
9963,9983,I just tried selfharm by stabbing my arm multiple times with razer and boy did it feel soo much better. Now I know why some people do it it is like a natural medicine Wow,Suicidal
9968,9988,So I met this girl on tinder 1 12 years . We became friends with benefits because as an attractive man I run into a lot of women who only likes me for my looks but breaks up with me because my depression is so bad. And to mention between us two I was the more attractive one and she leaned more towards average. I was 22 when we met and she was 18. I enjoyed her intelligence and could look past the obvious difference in attractiveness. She took the time to understand my mental health and stuck by me through my issues. I also help her with her family issues because her father was emotionally abusive and her mother is classified as psychotic but refuses help. As time went on we became increasingly involved with each other romantically and sexually which we both always consented to. My mother kicked me out so I wanted to get an apartment and she offered to be my roommate because she could not handle her father any longer. We finally got the apartment and it was like a dream come true we were always happy and barely argued and had more sex than we could even imagine. We adopted a kitten and I worked over night at Lowes as mst so I could barely stay awake to take care of the chores. And when I would be awake I would finally relax and play the Xbox for a little. She did not have a job and was paying rent with unemployment checks. Once unemployment ended I had to take care of the bills untill she could find a job 2 months later. I helped her start a tarot business and that brought in no where close to the amount required for rent. Though I still supported her even after also paying late fees. So when it comes to my depression and suicidal thoughts its random and the only way Id cope is by making music gaming and smoking weed. Her grandpa caused me to lose my job because he would always drop me off late even though I was paying him . So I was coping with this failure with my usually vices while she finally was hired . But I did not get the same support I displayed for her when she did not have a job . Music was paying the rent until my song was stolen by bk the rula. So I was in the deepest void that I have ever been in because this apartment was my first attempt at independence. She usually took acid at least 3 times a month for meditative reasons and suggested that I should try it because someone said it helps with depression and self realization. I was skeptical so I did not take it until 2 months later. She planned on taking it at the same time so I finally consumed it. The problem is she did not take hers and went to bed. I did not know this and began feeling the effects. At first it was pleasant and gave me this feeling of joy and an unwavering arousal. But then things took a really bad turn . I owned color changing led lights and the walls felt like they were closing in on me. All i could think about was killing myself nothing felt real thus convincing me that if I died nothing would matter or be concrete. I started punching myself and trying to rip out my hair. Then for some reason the flashing light got faster and increasingly vivid. I felt as if I was falling into my mattress while dying 1000 different ways in my mind but my thoughts felt like reality. Nothing existed but my sad scarred soul. I finally convinced my broken mind to get up and ask her for help . I was gripping the sheets trying to find something that felt real or I would have surely slit my own throat. Of course the feeling of arousal never left because that was the first reaction I received after consuming the substance. So her being the only woman I was intimate with I always felt comfort in her breasts and she has always consented prior to this incident. So for sum reason while under the influence I felt that her Boob was the most concrete thing in my reality so I held it while being the big spoon. She instantly told me to back off so I got up and left immediately feeling shame loneliness. I felt meaningless and was convinced that I was truly alone and should not exist. I lost my mind in my room until I passed out. The next morning I was finally coming down and was beyond traumatized. I spoke to her and explained what happened but all she could focus on is how she was traumatized from me holding her boob. I reminded her that we shared a bed every other day and that cuddling like that is a normal occurrence because we loved each other and pretty much was dating without a label. She finally seen it from my side and understood how scary it might have been for me. She held me and told me she was sorry and that she should have noticed what was going on.she offered to have sex to make me feel better but I declined because I am not into sexual pity. Also my depression has extremely increased since I have took the acid. The next morning I woke up and she was gone. She just abandoned the apartment and left me with the cat and half of my property was locked in her room. She did not come back until the last day and told everyone in my family and her friends that I sexually assaulted her. I was hurt and confused because I was left with a kitten and was losing my apartment that I worked so hard for. I paid for everything in there all she owned was a few things in her room. And to say I sexually assaulted her is a defamation to my image and character because I have never forced myself upon her .so I was angry heart broken and betrayed so I attempted suicided by slicing down my wrist with a razor and the razor was pretty much half way lodged into my wrist . My mom found me before I could bleed out and rushed me to the er. When I got back home I got into the locked room grabbed all my things and sum evidence her diary that she started when we first moved in and left with my kitten. Till this day she will not talk to me and is telling people I sexually assaulted her . Am I in the wrong ? The experience in that room full of lights still replays in my head and haunts me to this day . My friend who was once raped twice in the Dominican Republic says that this situation does not count as sexual . Can anyone give me advice on how to cope or what should I say to her or if I should take legal action? This would have never happened if I did not believe her and took the acid as a cure for depression. I was stupid for being so nave but therapy does not work and I am not up to taking any man made medications anymore . I just wanted to feel normal for once but I ended up feeling worse than when i started.Sorry for any misspelling and grammatical errors. My fwbroommate betrayed me and claims I sexually assaulted her but I do not think I did and I still love her. This caused me to lose my first apartment.help!,Suicidal
9981,10001,I do not get it I really do not. Today was actually the first nice day I have had in so long and I still feel bad inside. My head does not shut up and honestly I do not know if I am going to stick around much longer. Is there any way I can make the pain stopreduced? I do not want to hurt my family and friends by dying but I do not have another choice. My head does not shut up,Suicidal
9996,10016,Me and my girlfriend split over a month ago and I have been doing everything all say everyday to distract myself from thinking about it but I cannot and the realization of losing her and never getting her back really makes me feel like I dint have a purpose anymore and I could not give a shit less what happens to me anymore I just feel weak and alone I cannot manage a relationship or my own life anymore Same bullshit here,Suicidal
10005,10025,If thoughts about killing yourself are as common as they appear to be albeit taboo then were fucked.7.674 billion miserable people what a world! sAnd if these thoughts are not common?Then I am a freak. Something to be ashamed of disposed of.It has to be one way though does not it?Wonder what Id rather it be after all misery loves company. Haha. Damned either way.,Suicidal
10007,10027,I really do not understand why I find myself here suicide is not something I have ever attempted but it is something I have considered and started considering more and more as time goes on now that I have graduated college.The worst part is I do not think I have any good reason to do it. I am successful in a very wellpaying career. I am fairly smart and can apply myself. I am not hot by any means but I am attractive enough to have fairly good options on the dating apps more on this later. I have a loving if not smothering family also more on this later and a good amount of close online friends and some IRL friends that I still talk to online. I have longterm goals for myself that I want to see happen. It may seem that I have no right to be here and fuck maybe I do not but I am still absolutely fucking miserable and some days I wonder why I have not blown my brains out yet. Today's one of those days for some reason.It really just comes down to my inability to form intimate relationships. I do not really date anymore for me to be close enough with someone and like them enough to have sex with them is rare since moving back home. I also still live with my extremely obsessive parents in a pretty remote area which makes meeting new people super difficult. All of this leaves me feeling so isolated and behind from everyone and I am terrified to make any change in my life that could somehow fuck me up worse than where I currently am. Yeah I could afford to rent somewhere but what if that ends up making me more lonely while also burning thousands a month?Work keeps me occupied but the thoughts of you are never going to meet someone get married have a family be successful outside of working a 95 job what is the point of you still being here you will never find more friends and just like some of your college ones the rest will disappear as time goes on are getting more and more frequent. it is something I have considered,Suicidal
10031,10051,I know the kneejerk reaction is to call cops on people.To my utter detriment I am 100 sane. There is scarcely any reason or legal grounds to hospitalise me against my will save for the fact I have been rightfully and logically suicidal for the past 13 or so years.All the cops do is offer disgustingly hollow platitudes and then leave. Same for suicide hotlines or therapists or psych wards. Hot take but therapy and medication do jack shit when your issues stem from mostly material conditions such as oppression poverty loneliness and longterm often systemic abuse.Whenever I have a BPD meltdown and that is very often a lot of people opt to either ignore it or call the authorities. Due to my background of abuse and lapses in memory I will not trust a onetime it will be fine you can talk to me!. Alleged friends no longer commit to anything they promise or say in the heat of the suicidal crises. And I realise it is not an obligation. But I willingly subject myself to horrible shit to keep up to date with suicidal people again and again and again never resting assured I miraculously saved them.Comfort takes time. it is a lost art. Love takes time. As does trust and henceforth anything meaningful. I say I do not have friends having 400 friends on FB as it would be saying you have nutrition if you ate McD for every single meal ever. Comfort takes time. But dialling 112 and never saying a word is easy.What am I venting for then? A lament for the unlovable? Ode to the abandoned? Perhaps simply a reminder to take a long hard look at your real friendships. Check in with people. Pick out the ones you want to commit to and go balls to the wall because frankly some people like me can be saved but only with a lot of effort.Show up. We might object. Help up do the dishes. Bring groceries when you come. Organise things with solid dates and times. Be stern and uncompromising but touch us with love when you go in for that awkward hug.There will be obstacles. I do not trust a soul in a 500 km radius and then there is people I have unrequited feelings for and then there is America. Distance is a bitch but you will probably either drink or gamble that money anyway. Gods please just show up. I would have paid for every single trip I would have paid.But there was no comfort. In the end there was no one. No easy fixes. So if you are reading this odds are that you have someone you ought to show up for. Maybe even yourself. I only ever needed comfort not cops,Suicidal
10033,10053,I have a noose ready in my closet. I do not know when to do it I do not want to hurt my family but I do not want to keep suffering. I do not know what to do. I cannot tell anyone I am suicidal,Suicidal

10051,10071,One of my friends who was in my class keeps discussing the how they are going to commit in two days.Idk what to do and I am shaking so much out of fear...they are so content on going and I tried and tried to talk them out of it but they will not listen I am only 14 and I cannot even process what is going to happen.Idk who to do to because school is shut for the summer and idk who to call and my parents will get mad at me for talking to them in the first place.What do I do?Who do I go to? What do I say? I need help I have never been in this situation before please help me.... My friend keeps talking to me about suicide and told me today that they are going to commit in a few days ,Suicidal
10068,10088,I read back something I wrote when I was 14 today. It described a pretty distressed and depressed kid. 7 years on from that all I can think about is the thousands of mistakes I have made in my life and how they could reflect on my family. I tried drinking but that does not seem to work. I have so much shame and guilt from years of sexting at a young age when I did not understand consent and age differences. I know I have stuff to live for but right now I cannot see any of it. Just wish I could escape,Suicidal
10069,10089,I want to die so fucking bad. I am so fucking done. Too much pain and misery I want to die,Suicidal
10085,10105,I hate when like you tell someone your struggling with suicidal thoughts or tell someone your cutting or something like that and their immediate reaction is like oh my god please you need to get help you need to go to a doctor or a therapist and get help i know there just trying to help but when someone says that i do not want to talk to them it makes you feel awkard and that something is wrong with me.Or like if your asking like the safest places to cut and someone is like please do not cut your going to get through this this is not the answer its going to get better like yeah i know that but if someone is going to cut they should know how to do it 'safely' or at least as safe as possible. i hate this,Suicidal
10127,10147,I am a guy with no friends I have never had a girlfriend I feel like a cowardly loser. My mind feels like it is going to explode at any moment. Killing me seems the only way out. I wanted to turn off my mind for like 5 years,Suicidal

10151,10171,How do i make them feel at peace with my choice? I know it hurts but what can I do for them to accept it? How do I ease the suffering of my loved ones after I die?,Suicidal
10166,10186,I have had these thoughts for a month now... i know that it is not much but it just keeps getting worse..I am transgender so at the start they were just really strong gender dysphoria... but then i started... remembering all the bad things that i did... i hurted a lot of people in my life both phisically and mentally... i deserve all this suffering really. I do not blame the people who mock me for that really. Every single thing that i do is either futile or leads to me hurting someone. As i said before i hurted a lot of people in my life... and i do not want to do this anymore.. i want them to be happy. I want them to live a beautiful life... A life that i somehow limited...it is all my fault really. No one deserves to suffer. No one. Exept me. I know it. So the only thing that i want to say to them is I am sorry. For everything that i did.I hope they can live. They need to. After all i took away things from them... it is only fair for me to suffer while they enjoy living... Right? Every thing that they do is justified i know. it is not bullying absolutely not i deserve it... right...?I do not know what to do anymore... I am not ready for this... it happened all too quickly... i... should just die and stop making everyonemyself included suffering... right? I am sorry,Suicidal

10241,10261,Honestly I am exhausted I said to myself make it to 25 and see from there but I am 23 and I just do not have the energy anymore I have done research I have come up with a plan and I am pretty sure I can spend the next month dealing with the anxiety of what if I survive it and just end up badly hurtI just do not want to end it all and have the people that knew me at school and bullied me every day posting about it being so sad and they wished they had known or done something cos fuck those people they are the reason I am like it. I do not want people I barely knew who did not give a shit about be posting about my death for clout or likes. I am thinking of having it done by November,Suicidal
10248,10268,What sort of documentation and things do you need to get in order before you die? I have no dependents or significant other no debt and only about 1000 in assets and a few thousand in a checking account. I do not care what happens to any of this once I am gone not sure if that makes a difference. Just to be clear I do not have a date set but I am working on gaining access to means to end my life. Things to get in order before you die,Suicidal
10304,10324,I have been at my wits end for days and cannot take much more of this life. How do others go on like its all okay? What motivates you to keep going?,Suicidal
10306,10326,4 years ago I had to say goodbye to my friends from high school in year 11. going to College in the first year is not bad for me until the second year I was trying to get new friends and starting to be rude to me. I cannot ask their phone number because my former headteacher put me same high school class with same students in 5 years. at home I had nothing at my father's house only I am can do is helping him with anything take a bin building tiny ups and carrying things. I was bored with her house using a computer watch TV and video games all time. I always to be alone in my room all time I am so annoyed it makes me sick.I am not freefrom my parent's houses it is looked like a house arrest for my father's place I am not doing anything wrong. I will be deceased myself at 30 years old if this carries on forever. I loved my family so much but it is killing me in here. I am 20 my life is ruined,Suicidal
10321,10341,At 2am I will be hanging from the tree infrount of me and the pain of living will finally end i cannot wait I thought I would feel way more sad but I do not I do not feel anything just looking at the time and counting down I am here 12 hours from now the end,Suicidal
10345,10365,it never seems to be enough but I have been getting deeper and deeper the last several times and leaving really nasty scars. i do not want scars i just want this all to be over already i guess I am getting closer every time though but I am terrified of cutting some important tendon and surviving with that mobility loss after. why is it so hard to die why cannot it be over yet. one step at a time i guess ill be there soon enough practice makes perfect etc etc i hate that I have been getting better at hurting myself,Suicidal
10365,10385,i want to stay for my family cuz ik how much they love me and i love them so much but right now i just do not see a way for me to stay alive. I do not have any reason or point. I am just suffering everyday with these suicidal thoughts and they just will not go away. I am starting to think that i might actually do it and its scaring me. I do not want to die but i do not want to live like this anymore.. i feel like I am at my wits end. i do not even know why I am writing this but I am just so done with this shit.. i do not know what to do..,Suicidal
10386,10406,I guess it is just jealousy. I am just over here laying in my room all day alone while they get to have fun with their friends Seeing my old friends enjoying their life with their friends hurts me,Suicidal
10435,10455,I think a huge thing that makes me so depressed is the fact that nothing is permanent. Knowing some day my friends and loved ones will die some day I will graduate some day my favorite shows will end my favorite bands will disband my boyfriends will leave me etc knowing all of it will all end is so distressing. If I make it to 18 I want to get tattoos. Even if they fade I want to get SOMETHING that is permanent. Maybe when I am 18 things will be better and I can get a cool i got over my depression tattoo...I do not know if I can go that far in all honesty. I do not want to kill myself but I do not want to keep seeing everything around me end. Whether its now or in the future I do not want to see the things I love end or die or disappear. I do not want to keep living and it feels like a matter of time before I suck it up and just end it or until I find that painless method I have been hoping for or until I come to terms with what happens after death. I know the bad things are permanent. Are there any good things that are permanent? Please tell me about them. Give me something to look forward to. What is permanent?,Suicidal

10453,10473,I have the most supportive parents I could ask for they do everything for me. Yet the best I could do for them is stay in bed and not kill myself what a waste of energy for them. I am such a burden I cannot do anything right I am so fucking useless and costly. I wish I could go back in time and somehow stop my birth from happening that would save them the pain of having to deal with a pisslow child.I guess the best course of action now is to die for the sake of everybody around me and myself. Someday when I have it in me I might hang myself in a ravine I used to like walking down. I do not see any downsides my parents being able to focus on the kid that matters more money etc. And I am free from the pain. Why am I so ungrateful?,Suicidal

10480,10500,I have always hated myself and who I am. Every night I pray that I do not wake up the next morning. Sometimes I wish that I had not survived my suicide attempt last year. I wish that I had just died then. But here I am. Still living and hating myself each and everyday. I have no respect for myself. I hate myself. I hate everything about me,Suicidal
10492,10512,Pretty much given my all to someone time and time again but every time she breaks me heart but then comes begging for me back. And its broken me I do not feel like I am enough anymore I have lost my self worth and confidence and I do not understand why someone would do this to me. I could never hurt her like she is continually doing to me and I just want the pain to end now Feel like a burden,Suicidal
10498,10518,I have tried everything I like to do and it just does not seem to work. Ever since my mom's passing and my girlfriend not being able to love me anymore really makes me question if any of it is worth anymore if it is worth it to keep going. I do not want to let my friends down or make them feel guilty or sad and I feel conflicted. I only get average grades in school and I do not see much of a future for myself. I feel like I do not have much else to look forward to.,Suicidal
10509,10529,I am a joke and at this point its an open secret. no one in my field takes me seriously I am constantly unfulfilled. my friends treat me like shit especially since i came out and i have no one to talk to. i cannot kill myself because i have people that rely on me but goddamn if i could i would.idk why I am even writing this its just a stream of consciousness at this point but i hate everything and i hate myself the most. i sit back and watch actually good people flourish and every day i struggle to get out of bed. there is so many people i like so much but I am not even near good enough for them and i hate it. even the person I am head over heels for. they know how i feel but yet i still have to be there for them and encourage them to pursue the one they really love.thanks for reading i guess. maybe at some point ill actually be able to go through with it which would be nice. you think if i killed myself people would actually take me seriously?,Suicidal
10512,10532,I feel bad for her that there is a non zero chance she will be coping with the same thing within five years. My mom said the other day she does not know how parents of children who take their own life cope.,Suicidal
10516,10536,I am constantly crying myself to sleep over the pain of not being able to kill myself. I do not have a horrible life but it feels so routine and its exhausting. I find myself wanting to just end things because its just SO MUCH easier. But every time I have thoughts of suicide I just think about how my mom already lost one son and her husband I cannot put her though that again. I cannot hurt my family and friends that I know care for me but I just do not feel close to them anymore. I feel like the affection or compassion I show towards them are fake. All my emotions I show them feel so forced. I cannot even say I love you to my family without cringing. I just want to rest peacefully and the thoughts of hurting the people around pain me. How is that fair! Its not their life its mine. I should be able to do what I want. Its selfish that people want me to say alive because they will miss me. This constantly battle of wanting to die but I cannot kill myself hurts and I just bottle it up until it all comes out in tears and I am just left sleeping of exhaustion.I have never attempted to kill myself but I am afraid one day probably when my mom goes Ill end up doing it. And I cannot bring myself to talk to anyone because I can never be so open with anyone not my family and not even my girlfriend to an extent. Maybe I should try therapy but every experience I hear from people is horrible. So I am just forced to sleep it off and when I am asleep it all just goes awaythe pain the exhaustion the pressure. Its the best feeling in the world. The best drug. I just cannot stop crying,Suicidal
10567,10587,Currently 17 close to 18 and I hate everything about myself. I hate the way I look how I feel and my anxiety is slowly killing me. I feel constantly judged all the time and never feel like I am good enough for anyone not even myself. I live a decent life but I have nothing going for me. I have not been happy in almost 4 years now there is nothing I do that makes me happy. I do not have a life worth living. The girl I feel so passionate about is with someone else and i hate it. I do not feel like I am good enough for anything. I am just so tired of living through the same day over and over. I do not feel like my life is as worth it as people say it is. Everyone always tells me it gets better and if I wait good things are coming for me but they have not and it does not seem like they will. I hate myself and my life,Suicidal
10579,10599,I would honestly say as great life has been it really is not all that kind of do not want to be talked out out of it as I am already emotionally over it and have been for so long now.Just want the deets on making it painless Most painless ways to die,Suicidal
10583,10603,I am 16 and I really want to die but I am afraid that I am going to have a failed attempt and my life's going to get worse. I wish I did not have to think this way I wish my parents let me study what I wanted so I was not such a failure and a disappointment to them. In the beginning of this year I broke down and told my mother that I could not concentrate on my studies no matter how hard I tried and that I did not think I would be capable to study science in Grade 11 but she did not listen to me. She told my father and he did nothing but berate me and they told me that if I act crazy again they would punish me. I am very scared of disappointing people but no matter how hard I try I end up doing just that. I cannot back away from anything now my courses have been paid for and they are really expensive and I do not think my parents could afford losing all that money. Even if they could recuperate I am certain that they are going to make my life hell and not allow me to change to any other course. I really wanted to study literature and I was really fond of reading books and learning languages but all the pressure to be something I am not made me lose the will to even pick up a book and I do not feel interested in doing anything anymore. I used to be good at English and writing papers and loved learning but now I am barely even passing English. I do not have a way to fix this and neither do I have a way out. I feel like a failure around people my age because they seem to have set their mind on what they are studying and are excelling. My parents want me to sit for the national medical entrance test which is in 1.5 yrs but I know I am going to fail it and I have nothing I can do after that. I am tired of feeling like a failure I am tired of pretending I am trying my best I am not trying at all I cannot try. I just want all this to stop. I do not want to keep on lying to everyone around me but I am too scared to kill myself.,Suicidal

They do not teach life skills improve personality many topics like mental health dating sex education Household repairs maintenance marriage raising kids etcWe just never learn some important stuff and hence suffer which were never taught.

10750,10770,Hello! First let me start off by saying that I do not like myself at all and I am realizing how little I mean to people. I am giving up. it will all be over soon for me. I am going to break a mirror and hope one of the shards is big enough for me to stab my throat with. I will bleed to death probably or just suffocate. I am okay with either one! does not really matter as long as the job gets done. I cannot stand living. it is endless and repetitive regret and just not fun. I am 21 my birthday is next month. No one has ever cared abt my birthday or that I am even alive. I do not feel loved by anyone. I am all alone. I hate being me so much. I would rather die than continue living like this! I already self harm and stuff so what is the big deal right? Who gives a shit anymore?! I never really mattered in the first place I was born just so my dad could play house with my mother! Absolutely disgusting that my life had to be as wasted as it is. But it is all good I guess. I just want everything to end in a healthy way. So this is life huh,Suicidal
10756,10776,you yeah you. take this moment to stop here for a while and listen what I have got to say to you.you made it to an another day I am really proud of you. i bet its been hard on you I am sorry for that. you are brave for not giving up even when you felt like doing so.keep going you can do it!! remember to be yourself do not change yourself for anyone else.you are you the perfect creation lt3 no one would be there to replace you as you are so special. think on yourself do not try to please everyone as its not possible in this cruel world. i wish i could give you all comfort and be there for you but its really hard to do that one by one. I am trying my best but it takes me time as i want to write every message personally not just copy paste the same thing on and on.stay strong guys long hugs for everyone lt3 you stop here for a moment,Suicidal
10759,10779,People need to stop coming on others posts and telling them it will get better. it will be ok you will get through this Etc. when they have no idea about their situation. Telling them this does not matter or that does not matter. You cannot change peoples values and priorities. People need to stop,Suicidal
10771,10791,I am going to start off with I do not have a plan or anything like that. All I have is a loss of hope.I was finally feeling like I really fit in with my new friends but after some poor decisions and a week long depressive episode that ended in me trying to take my own life a lot of them are very upset with me.I left our group so they could have time to heal but I do not know if I will ever be invited back.I am leaving out details of exactly what occurred but it is safe to say that they are not overreacting. They have every right to feel the way they do after the way I acted.I do not know where to go from here. I have done everything I can do to try and help them heal and it is out of my control now. They at the very least need time away from me so I am making sure I give that to them.I do not know what the real point of me posting this is because I am not sure there is advice that can help my situation. Losing friends due to my own actions has left me feeling awful and alone,Suicidal
10780,10800,I am afraid of the pain of dying and potentially failing to die. But I have no desire or energy to exist anymore so I just lie around letting my life fall apart while pushing everyone away inching closer and closer to it. I really feel trapped and every aspect of my life makes me want to leave this all behind. I really do not see how my nonexistence would affect anyone negatively except maybe feeling sad for some time which is normal but ultimately they would be better off. I just do not see the use of me being here except sucking up resources that others need. I cannot find any real reasons to live so it makes it really hard to help myself. I feel hopeless and my life is falling apart and i cannot stop it. I do not know what to do. Trapped,Suicidal
10783,10803,I am a black dark skin Female. I wish death on myself everyday... I took my braids out last night. Braided them again so yknow my hair will get curly. I woke up this morning and took the braids out and comb it a lil bit and the curls were gone... I got so mad I started tugging my hair so hard it hurted my scalped. I started to talk to myself. I fucking hate myself so much I want to dieI have those thoughts everyday everywhere I go. I despise my black skin my strawberry legs my black features my I am at Walmart rn so Ill continue this later I despise myself so much,Suicidal
10816,10836,Due to something that has happened between us were not friends anymore. I will not go into any details but he hurt me on levels that I did not think were possible. I trusted him. He knew all of my secrets my strengths and weaknesses my past aspirations and goalsand according to him I only knew 17 of him. I was always okay with that. Until today. We were so close. I am ready to overdose on painkillers now. Or stab myself with one of our kitchen knives. This is the last straw. I cannot do this anymore. The one person who I thought was my best friend hurt me so deeply that I probably will not be able to recover. He knows he hurt me and he intended it. He knows I am suicidal and it makes him happy. I am so disgusted and hurt and tired and angry I just want to slit my throat open and die. He was the last thing keeping me here. And now were done. Lost my best friend today,Suicidal
10851,10871,Why live when you lose something you once said you cannot lose? Why continue on when everything you ever wanted in life is gone? Why live when the only thing you now try to survive for is potentially upsetting others about your death? Why? I saw a future so amazing that was within my grasp and when I was about grab it I metaphorically fall on my face and lose everything. Since then I have isolated myself entirely. The more time goes on the more I hope it entices me to get the guts to end the suffering. I went from loving life never having suicidal thoughts to in an instant seemingly being so indifferent to everything. Overwhelming is an understatement. I deserve everything I am feeling and I feel as though its only a matter of time before destiny seals my fate by my own hand Why live?,Suicidal
10857,10877,So basically I know I am a bit insecure person but I try my best to never tell someone about it and pretend that I am fine with it. But I am really too much sad because of the jokes made by my girlfriend and her male friends. So basically my girlfriend has only male friends and I really do not have any problem with that. So in our friends group too she is the only girl. So me and my girlfriend are in 2 common Instagram Group Chats where she is the only female. So all the other people flirt with her make jokes and she does not care and even replies to them around 1 month ago she and her friend intentionally flirted in front of me by saying can I come to your bed tonight and I ignored it because she always says that they are just jokes. But the next day they intentionally made the same joke again and this time I told her friend that these jokes are inappropriate and her friend talked to me in a rude way with very abusive words and in the end they said we were doing a prank to make you jealous. This really made me too sad for few days later she apologized. Now the same things have started again in one group chat almost everyone is flirting with her one guy even made a joke about marrying her. In the other group chat our common friend literally moaned her name in a voice note 3 times and she continued the joke. Then the common friend said to me your girlfriend is falling for me and she wants to cheat on you in the group chat and she still thinks it is a joke. I already have a low self esteem where I always think that everyone is better than me and when I tell someone this they blame me by saying I am insecure. I am really tired of this it literally feels like that I am a loser who cannot do anything.Also my girlfriend is too insecure too when I talk to any girl she taunts me a lot and to everyone that is cute. We had a common female friend in that gc and my girlfriend said you need to take my permission before talking to each other. And everyone thought it was cute because she is a girl. While she literally flirts with everyone and everyone insults me and it is still a joke. I am suicidal again after months because something bad happened today. My life is already too bad and I always feel like a burden to everyone and today I had a a really bad day.,Suicidal
10884,10904,I just came back from meeting with my friends. It was not enjoyable. Like at all. Why cannot I just be fucking dead already I hate this all,Suicidal
10891,10911,no more. i am done. i took x amount of my weak prescription benzo i counted that it will probably kill me with this amount of alcohol. let us hope. pray for me that it is not too painful and i can just sleep away. i am done with almost 30 fucking years of being worth nothing. my earliest memory is sexual abuse LMAO i am not normal i will never be able to function normally pretend that i am a real human allowed to be her own person i was put here to serve pedophile scum opportunists sadists narcissists but i do not want anymore. i have no self i have nothing to live for now i am in a new country and i already got used up even here. the good thing is that because i am close with no one they will find me only when I am already a rotting corpse. I am leaving behind a dirty apartment and while i feel shame for it i also feel like maybe for once it is my right to inconvenience peopleciao disposable fulfiller of other people's needs,Suicidal
10899,10919,I am right at the edge of finally dying. I have everything I need. I am so fucking close. Why do I hesitate. This is what I have wanted for so long. I am right there and I cannot. I do not want to fail at this like I failed everything else. Why cannot I do it,Suicidal
10972,10992,So this is my first post here. I do not really know what to say. I want to end my life? I do not know. I am morbidly obese and I am trying everything in my power to lose weight but I am addicted to food and it is not working. All the thoughts going through my head will not let me sleep and it is almost 530am. I just want to start over. Do the right things. I do not want to live like this anymore. Last time I contacted a help service I was sectioned in the psych ward and lost my job. I do not want that to happen again so I am really apprehensive to contact them again. I do not know what to do. I just want it all to end. I feel like I am done living. I cannot picture myself getting to my next birthday. I cannot picture myself being around for another two months. I am just really really done and I do not know what to do. I cannot stop thinking about killing myself.,Suicidal
10975,10995,I am bad at everything i like. I like video games and i suck but like really really really suck. Same with 3D design and renders and stuff. Same with programming. Same with hiking. Same with trampoline. Same with cooking. Same with languages. Same with computers. Same with every single thing.But I am just good enough at these that people who do not know anything about this think I am good while everyone else think I am a moron.Plus I am annoying not social i do not have friends I am too lazy to go to school or find a job I am ugly I am weak I have never had a girlfriend I am just sitting at home all day long in front of my computer doing basically nothing. Fuck this life i cannot anymore. I suck at everything and everything bores me,Suicidal

11050,11070,original post surrogate dad and I have a selfdeprcating sense of humor. I remembered some joke he made the other night. I was walking by the railroad and then I laughed about how fucked I am. Do you ever just laugh and then start crying at how fucked you really are? I called and told him I was going to kill myself. He told me he was coming to take me home for good far from my biological parents. I am in my 20s with college and three jobs.Maybe there is a reason to believe you will be okay. update killing myself by railroad it is not going to be today.,Suicidal
11071,11091,Do you actually have to go through with it and fail? Or does it count if you never actually got to go through with it for itger reasons.For example if you tried to hang yourself but could not do it because you could not climb the tree. Would that be an attempt or not since you never actually failed and you did not actually hang yourself? What counts as a suicide attempt?,Suicidal
11089,11109,I do not feel good. Just hating myself even more. Hope it is as easy as pulling the trigger... Wish a handgun was on my table right now...,Suicidal
11099,11119,Please do not blame me or anyone else. In fact I was unbelievably lucky to make it this far. My parents are and always were caring. My brother and sister have always wanted the best for me. I just have a malfunctioning brain that makes me unhappy all the time. Even when I am happy it means that I am about to do something terribly irresponsible and stupid that will hurt those close to me. The best thing I can do for everyone involved is to bow out now. To those who say this is a selfish move you will be over it in a couple of weeks but you would rather condemn me to a lifetime of misery. Id just like to send a big Fuck you to those guys In case you are interested I am still in love with Tessa from high school and a girl called Bara who I met at a drumming circle this summer. AnonymousPS to my daughters Abbey amp Zoey I can never do this because of you. I love you too much and do not want you to feel like this would be your fault. Of course its not but people tend to blame themselves. So I guess I am sticking around. I love you Abs lt3 amp Zo lt3 I decided to not end my life today.,Suicidal
11126,11146,i cut my arm multiple times nothing too deep just scratches but there is noticeable scars how do I hide them? help with cuts,Suicidal
11129,11149,i was reading a bunch of suicide bereavement but i noticed that the one thing everyone mentions is how their daily routine is affected. how they do not see or talk to that person any more because they are gone.i do not have that kind of impact on any one. i do not have any kind of relevance. I am still alive but everyone is already moved on from my existence.and if they genuinely believe that Things will get better then there is no way that me killing myself will really harm them right? things will just get better. everyone i know has already adjusted to a life without me,Suicidal
11146,11166,I know I should not care what others think but part of me worries about others using this post against me sometime. I still need to post it though. So wednesday was the anniversary of when my brother died. For some details I guess check out my post on rPTSD. I am autistic and really struggle to do a lot of things I want to do when they involve just myself. Its a LOT easier when others are involved. I finally was cleaning my room today FINALLY and then I found a spider. I had to take work off yesterday and did get some stuff done and then today but now I am hiding on the couch. I tried asking for help but that did not do anything except show me I should be trying to figure it out myself instead of asking. My dad died last month and I am just so tired of going on by myself. I hope a dog is worth fighting for but there is a lot I need to figure out first and I do not know if its going to happen. Not sure what will happen if I have to wait even longer for that. I also have mild versions of many other disabilities and it does not feel like life should be this hard because of that. I am trying to reach out for help but its not enough currently and takes time to get. Plus others have lives that do not involve me and I hate interrupting that so much. But I cannot do it myself either. I would honestly rather not do it than ask for help if possible but that cannot happen for everything so I am stuck being a burden. I am a major fawner meaning I try to please when possible and make life easier for others. I prefer others offering than me asking and I keep getting frustrated by minor things especially when something does not go how I want it to. My laptop decided to stop turning on last month as well and I should just get a new battery but its not that easy. My therapist gave me a different one but it is not a gaming laptop and needed to update when I turned it on. TLDR I am trying I really am but its not enough and I really do not want to bother anyone else. I was FINALLY doing better and then a spider ruined it and now I just want to give up. I have already tried asking for help and I am just a bother and need to figure it out for myself. I might ask for help one more time but now there is a chance of other spiders in my room because I have not been able to keep it clean no matter how much I try. I tell myself I need to clean and I just sit there on my phone instead. I am really trying,Suicidal
11170,11190,So here am I I do not know why I take the time I writing this but I been trying to seek help but gain nothing nonetheless is like nobody cares I feel so sad tries to commit suicide 3 weeks ago with pill over dosis but failed. Been thinking a lot of stuff of why I do actuallly feel like being stomachache sick try to get out of house to go to grannys one but I just feel overwhelmed with everything I just want to go far away and stop bothering anyone I am just sorry for everything and nothing at the same time I am just so sad I feel so sad,Suicidal

11220,11240,I just feel so horrible deep inside I want to just die all day long. I do not have friends and never had any because of my fucked up mental illnesses including social anxiety which is literally the worst thing anyone could have i would not wish it on my worst enemy. I also have an extremely low self esteem that is so hard to deal with looking in the mirror is the worst feeling. I cannot go anywhere with the feeling of looking like a deformed human in the back of my mind haunting me. I turn 19 soon and I am going to be alone as always which is so sad and I cannot take it anymore. I try to get in a relationship but I am embarrassed because I am the most boring pathetic human that walks on this earth. I self harm because my life is so sad and I am just done being garbage I want to die so badly I can only take so much M 18 I am done being sad and alone 247,Suicidal
11253,11273,I am honestly just really sick of it all. i know people have it worse and honestly that makes me feel worse too. i feel like life's punching bag i feel like every time i start to get over something it gives me a brand new sob story. its tiring I have never caught a break and no one seems to be able to tell how horrible things get for me. its not just bad days these things turn into months and years. the worst part about it is that i was not even given a fair playing ground to begin with. no matter how hard i look back i feel like I have always felt different. not in the edgy i like sports and hate dresses way but in the way where there was something just... off. like no matter how hard i try to be like how I am sure I am supposed to i never feel like everything is quite right. there is always something out of place but it is not tangible so i cannot fix it. even in my most enjoyable and carefree moments there is a slight feeling that holds me back that I am reminded of right before i have fun. it never goes away and i have no idea what it is. maybe that is just how life feels and I am just crazy and think there is something that is not there. maybe it is just my anxiety or depression like people keep telling me. maybe its just puberty idk!! it just feels like I am not experiencing life the way others do and not like in the way where i do not go out or something but like there is something fundamentally wrong with me. i feel crazy and i do not know why i cannot just live my life like everyone else why it feels like there is always an extra step for me like i need to try harder for the same results even if I am technically not doing anything at all. this feels separate from my anxiety and depression but no one else seems to think so. they do not get it because they are not feeling it. my mom is going to arrange yet another meeting with my doctors to figure out what is wrong with me again so i can go on meds again. I am scared they will make me go really crazy like my last ones did but it is whatever because i know going on them would make her feel better for me. i just wish she would get out of my room. you relapse and self harm really bad ONE TIME two months ago suddenly you need to be supervised at all times. they act like i cannot find shit to hurt myself with at school it is honestly making that seem like a fun option. whatever i just hope i can figure out what is wrong with my brain. thanks for reading all this. I am slightly off,Suicidal
11290,11310,The only reason I have not killed myself is my girlfriend and my dog.The only reason I have not killed myself is my girlfriend and my dog. I could not bare the thought of leaving them alone considering I am all she has and I could not imagine abandoning my dog. Life fucking sucks. It sucked enough before this pandemic started but now I cannot even afford to pay for my billsfoodmedication. I had to take out multiple credit cards and borrow money from family members just to get through the last few months and now they are all maxed out. I have to drive an hour away for work just to drive 810 hrs a day 56 days a week to get treated like absolute shit by customers. My line of work is quickly drying up and I am making half of what I was making 6 months ago. I am a very frugal person and NEVER spend money on things that are not completely necessary.I only see my girl one day a week and it puts a big strain on us both. she is the only thing keeping me going and I barely even get to see her now. I have sent out hundreds of resumesapplications over the past 2 months for jobs so I can have a stable paycheckspend more time with my girlfriend. I have gotten 2 interviews which have not amounted to anything. I have numerous health problems and I am in constant pain dispite being in my midtwenties.Everyday I am holding back constant tears and suicidal thoughts. Anybody have some words of advice? Or been in a similar situation?TLDR can barely afford a place to live food meds. Taken out a good amount of debt just to survive and cannot take out any more credit cards. Am in constant pain but doctors do not care enough to do anything for me. Only reason I have not killed myself is my gf and my dog because I am all they have. Spend all day working an exhausting job I hate while being treated like shit for shit pay while fighting back tears and suicidal thoughts. The only reason I have not killed myself is my gf and my dog.,Suicidal
11293,11313,You ever just wonder why you still exist in this world? Like rn I am stuck in a toxic relationship that makes me hate life more than anything. I want to be happy so bad but I cannot get away from them and its so sickening. I have attempted suicide recently to escape this person and they took me to the ER sadly and I am still here clearly. I just do not get why I cannot just be happy. I am medicated and I go out in the world but its always just a fake happiness. Like I find peace in the thought of my death. It just sounds calm and nothing further negative can continue on. Its just a nothingness void. All I have is crappy luck and a brain that wants me to self destruct. Anyone else? You ever just wonder,Suicidal
11333,11353,I dream a lot nowadays.. I dream when I am awake and I dream when I am asleep. I dream when I am working and when I am doing nothing at all. At first it felt nice.. dreaming all day and night. Forgetting reality and thriving in another world as another person. There in those dreams I could be everything I wish I was now.. it was and is still so welcoming. But slowly daydream after daydream i forget that it is not real.. I forget that those emotions and people that this world I created is not real.. Ill see my surroundings change when I am taking a walk outside all of a sudden I am in a forbidden forest. When i look down to my clothes I am wearing a corset and dress instead of the jeans and crop top I wear out.. and then Ill whisper words to no one but in my day dream I speak normally and with a friend. Ill wave my hands and Ill cry and feel every emotion in my bones as if it were real. Then all of a sudden I am dragged back into reality my mind still hardwired to that of my daydream and I think things like when I find a dragon or of course! The Bermuda Triangle is where all the mythical creatures hide themselves away from humans! And I forget that it is not real. That in reality that type of magic does not exist. Then I fall into depression again as I remember my life is not like the books I read.. even as a witch who communicates with her gods the type of magic where you just wave your hands and everything is suddenly clean and put together is not true that fairies are not real and werewolves and dragons do not exist. I forget to often what is real and what is not the lines they blur and i fear I am going crazy. Like I am split between another reality and this one. Escapism has become to much instead of the great coping mechanism it was its started to slowly kill me.. is it wrong of me to want to let these daydreams overwhelm me.. is it wrong that I want to stay in them forever.. never waking from them.. I want to let them drag me away kill me and overwhelm me.. all because I do not wish to face reality again. My dreams are taking control of my life and I can no longer tell what is reality and what is not,Suicidal
11342,11362,I want to stop feeling depressed n wanting to end my life but I really do not know how. What am I suppose to do I want to feel better but Idk how,Suicidal
11403,11423,happy birthday to me lmao I turn 21 at midnight yet I still want to kill myself.,Suicidal
11408,11428,Recently my life has not been the best by recently I mean almost about a year now I just feel like its getting worse and worse I keep telling myself that its going to get better but it just does not seem like that will happen at all. For a couple of months these thoughts have been popping up in my head. I have always put others first through out my whole life. And I feel like maybe that is why I do not really pay attention to those thoughts and take action. But now I am starting to think that it will not really matter if I am gone. Why do not I just do it.,Suicidal
11418,11438,As the title says I feel defeated. Ready to just end my life and never have to worry about this constant cycle of stress only to see a glimmer of hope that gets crushed as soon as you think it is safe to reach for it. It genuinely feels like life for me and people like me in this society specifically is only granted to prove that hope truly is not viable and that our lives and our beings are merely stepping stones for the more lucky.I used to genuinely love people. Deeply unconditionally love people. I still do but I hate to admit that because it makes me naive and open for hurt. And it extends to most all people and before I could handle the fact that people are imperfect that is fine I can still handle that. I still feel that love for people in my life even despite terrible low points. I have always been able to forgive and distance and move on if wronged. Not wishing bad on those who wronged me. I still do not. But that changed these past few years. I went into a deep depression and I still have not gotten over past trauma my dysfunctional family inflicted on me. That they still inflict. Because I love them and I forgive them and recognize what they did was wrong but I still care about them because we are all only human on this planet. there is always a reason and meaning and people have good in them most of the time. If they do not expand it I just distance but still wish for them to change and do what is best. So I distance but the distance does not fix my mental state or the distrust and pain that plagues me and my current relationships to others. I am secretive. I find that to be my biggest downfall. I never allow myself to be truly open and I lock away deeply intimate parts of myself and the things I enjoy and love personally. I never share my writing the things I enjoy most or my media preferences. Even though it is all harmless I keep it under wraps and I know it is due to trauma from my upbringing. I can link it distinctly. Nobody would expect my death and I know they would not because even my partner has no idea how debilitating my mental health gets. And it makes me angry I feel burned. I am not able to be myself. I am not able to honestly connect with those in my day to day life. I was forced to hide most everything about me growing up lest it be suppressed or judged harshly or used to hurt me. And I cannot do it anymore. I have lost so much of myself that I will never find those pieces again to put myself back together whole. Words are only a temporary distraction before it all comes down to crush me again. And for that I know that without the 247 distractions of other people and work and hobbies I cannot function. I am not whole on my own mentally or physically I feel. My cousin committed suicide 5 years ago and it is like a mirror and some days I envy them. I envy that they escaped and I hate myself for even being capable of thinking that way. I feel like a hypocrite for thinking of doing what I have begged and convinced others not to do.I am currently unemployed due to the pandemic. Started taking care of a stray now I have kittens to take care of as well. I cannot drive due to disability which makes things harder I feel too burdening on my partner. So I push myself into freelance work up keeping everything to a high standard never taking a break from videos or auditory outlets as I work always distracting myself. But it is all a distraction and I am wearing on them when they ask about what is wrong and I open up about my mental health or have anxiety attacks or mental breakdowns.Why are you like this Why do you have to be like this?I cannot stay in this relationship if you cannot get better.Why is something always wrong with you?cannot you do this later Why do you have to do this right now? What the fuck do you expect me to do What the fuck is wrong with you now? And so I keep it all down I suppress it and I feel physically awful all the time. Chronic migraines I never get a break where my mind is not trying to distract itself or is not in an existential dread or downfall. it is not worth living like this even as much as I love my pets and partner and family. I do not want to leave them but I feel I have to. I wish it was like the romanticized versions of mental health issues. Where your partner holds you and tells you it will be okay instead of the reality of your partner getting stressed and cracking every now and then and yelling and making it worse and saying hurtful things that come back around the next time no matter how hard you try to forget it. When I get like that being held and told it is going to be okay sounds like something otherworldly and heavenly and amazing. I really want to end it all especially knowing that I will never have that. I have had that maybe a few times and only after being torn down only after the person who has the misfortune of seeing me like that calms down. Even then they never learn a better way to handle it or listen to me or care to remember when I try to get out what I need and how to handle the situation I say what my therapist has told me to tell others it does not work because I guess they all forget. it is a cycle of pain relief at last and then forget. Then repeat. Constantly. And I am too weak to handle it. there is good reason for me living. I know if I passed many would miss me greatly and my pets would likely be confused or miss me as well. I do not want that to happen I suppose but I want to end this constant suffering and that seems like a small price to pay. Though I also do love being sentient and conscious I love listening and seeing and hearing new things. I love learning and in this world and universe there is so much to learn I could spend a lifetime doing so even though I may not have access to formal higher education I have a phone and access to videos lectures news and studies. That might be worth sticking around for but I only love it so much because it is a distraction from my deeper troubles. So why dwell in it and continue the distraction? Even when I write this stuff it makes me cry hard because towards the end I realize how much I enjoy life and living and I realize how hard and near incapable I am of doing so fully. It makes me feel shattered and bleak. Why even write it at all?It feels like I cannot even trust my own brain anymore. I already cannot trust it. Why even go on if I cannot trust my own brain? I just want to be happy like I was before. I feel defeated,Suicidal

11474,11494,TW SA from the ages 611 i was sexually abused by my 2 uncles and cousin. after i finally realized i could just say no to going to c that family. i vaguely remember it. but i remember knowing about sex at a really young age. i started cutting tried killing myself a couple times in middle school. my mom brushed it to the side because she did not believe in depressionmental health. she would constantly compare me to my cousin who was very polite girly and fun. and i always felt as though i could never live up to my moms standards. comes my junior year of high school my mom has had enough of me telling her i do not want to go see my tas and tos. i do not want to go because they used me. she does not know why i do not want to go but she is had it. she choked me. she fucking choked me. and i hit her and fought hard to get her off me. i called the cops and they did not believe me. i was stuck with her. I have just been very exhausted from living with my family. i feel like idek who i am or who i was. i keep thinking about who i could have been. what could have been. i know i should try to move on but its so hardim trying i really am but every time i see how my boyfriends family treats each other I am filled with so much jealousy. and its a reminder that i will never have that. vent?,Suicidal
11492,11512,Is this possible or should I just save it for my therapist? I spent a decade planning and then attempting my suicide. For a decade. Thinking about suicide became one of my deepest habits. I still have chronic obsessive ideation. Even when I was happy I thought about it almost daily passively.But I cannot really talk about it. People assume I am unstable or overwhelmed. I am not. I am just opening up about how I always feel. I do not want reassurance. I want to stop hiding that part of my personality all the time. The masking is draining.I do not know how to express this without alarming anyone though. I do not want them to think they can help me. I feel like I have a moral obligation to hide how I feel about suicide around them. How do you handle talking about suicide when you know you are not really allowed to talk about it? How to talk about suicide in a non toxic way?,Suicidal
11493,11513,I enjoy writing and being by myself. I have some projects lined up that should release in the next year or two. I do not expect to become rich what I hope is that these projects will perform well enough to allow me to quit my job. If not I think I will live off any remaining savings for a month or so enjoying final moments then death.In the United States apparently none of us have the capability to produce thoughts. If you stand around in silence people will be bothered by it. Have to always talk and smile. For my entire life I have been talked to as if I am a complete idiot. To be smart have to always talk and never think... Tired of being talked down to. Tired of living in such a grossly ignorant country. Tough to find fulfilling work. I like my mind and I like to think and feed my varied curiosity. Writing seems like the only joy to fulfill these desires. Though I once tried a job that at least provided physical fulfillment landscaping. Basically get paid to work out in the sun be surrounded by nature. I applied landscaping maintenance but they ended up placing me on landscape construction which is currently out of my capabilities due to such immense heavy lifting. Tried telling HR about this ended spending an hour with two higherups telling me that I should not be disruptive. When I had went into the job interview I told the higherup that I am a little reluctant 30 pounds is probably my lifting limit. He responds Oh you will just be planting flowers. A 50 pound slab is quite the flower.Job that I currently do is not horrendous but four or five constant 12 hour shifts is a bit of a drag. And while it is unintional having my coworkers talk to me as if I am a complete idiot just because I am quiet not an existence I want to keep living. I have lived pretty well and I have given and will give a few more shots for a worthwhile life. does not seem to make sense to perform unfullfiling work. Or to live in a country that likes to promote individuality yet will expect everyone to constantly talk. I dread humans,Suicidal

11540,11560,Hello all. I am writing this to help out a close friend. Me and a Dr. she is seeing suggested she go to an inpatient rehab facility so that she can safely come off the dreaded effexor she was wrongfully prescribed for several yrs. she is tried doin it herself but the stresses of her daily life trigger her very easy to harm herself. She is worried about the financial burden it will put on herself keeping her apartment and the care of 2 teenage daughters while she is out for the 3 months. Are there any individuals she could talk to that can point her in the right direction to use any resources available to her to make her 3 month absence as easy as possible? Thank you Inpatient worries,Suicidal
11545,11565,I already know I do not have much of a direction in life. I always planned on committing to when I was 18 and now that I am just stuck. I am supposed to go to college but I do not really want to and Imnow signed up for classes but unsure of my major. I wanted to move out at 18 too and have someone that wants to be my roommate but I just cannot make myself take up on that opportunity.When I was 16 I had plans and full intentions to kill myself by a certain date but then my now ex partner asked me about 10 days before that. I never told them this but still I based my entire future around that relationship. And I still had suicidal ideation throughout the entire relationship the only thing that changed was that now I had a tangible reason to not do it right away. I feel like at that point I accepted that I was going to die from suicide it was just now I was playing the waiting game for the final straw. I know that I still have time and opportunities and I know that I am skilled enough so that if I could push myself do to make something out of myself I probably could. I just do not want to since I just do not care about living . Plus if you are a bad person and have multiple untreated mental illnesses and trauma should not be okay by a certain point? Its unfair that I am not allowed to give up. When is it okay,Suicidal
11565,11585,so I am 14 and right when 2021 started i moved schools i was pretty sad mostly because i would not be able to talk to my friends in person and stuff but i stayed positive. for the first couple days nobody talked to me and I thought that was normal because it happens often but they will eventually talk to me right? and so these first days became weeks then became months and I have been in this school for 7 months and I have no friends I have tried to talk to people which is really fucking hard for me I am really bad at socializing and talking to people and whenever i talked to someone i feel like they just talk to me out of pity I have just been really sad my parents do not take it seriously and i do not really have anyone to talk about this with I have thought about suicide I do not think I would ever actually do it but I think of it alot and I really hate the fact that nobody takes me seriously on this my mom thinks I am doing it for attention and my father thinks the same. I think I am just not a good person to be around and I just felt like saying this to someone. sorry if there are any typos my country's first language is not english. just felt like saying this to someone,Suicidal
11570,11590,it is too long for me now. Everything just gets worse and worse. there is nothing in this world i know but pain sadness and tears. I just need someone that loves me how I am someone that does not only criticizes me or says how bad I am and everytime I find a person like this I think I get friend zoned instantly I mean that does not mean that is bad but I want a person that lays beside me in my bed and that I can hold tightly and feel safe with. And why can I give so many people good advises but I can help myselft even a little bit. I think I am just too broken for everything. A long time I could hide my sadness but now it is hard to not break down in tears every single second I am awake and that is just annoying. And even my friends I can talk about everything I do not think they want to hear me more crying about myself so that is why I just stopped talking about my feelings lately. One example is I met this girl only around 2 months ago and I think i could talk with her about everything that bothers me but lately I feel like everytime I say to her that I am sad she just gets annoyed by this and this really breaks my heart because I really do not want to lose her I already lost so many people in my life another one would break me completely. I really do not know what I am going to do the next years I am so afraid that I am doing something really bad to me because I do not want to disappoint my parents or my friends that I am so weak. I have never showed any of my weaknesses to anyone but I do not wana do this anymore I do not want to fake anything about me. I think life and everything around it is just a cruel and depressing place. I hate it to be single I just want to be loved but I really do not think that anyone ever could really love me and this just fcks me up. There is no day in like 2 years now where I do not cry me to sleep. And on top of everything in the last months everything around me changed and that to fast I had to let go of long friends I had to realize a close friend of mine is in deep depressions and so much more and I just cannot process all of it. I tried talking to that girl I mentioned before but she acts completely different than at the first days I talked to her. She was like she did not tried to give a good advice or to comfort me she just like said to me that I cannot change it and I should not bother about it which is not really helpful. I mean I am not mad at her I am just confused and I am too shy to ask her why she is acting so different. I am just such a weak person like I am not even trying anymore to be strong or sth because it does not matter I can smile how long i want I public it does not will change anything ever. I do not want to kill myself but at the same time I do not want to love anymore I just want to not exist anymore and no one on this entire planet ever remembers me or even knows that I existed. Everytime this girl texts me I can smile and even when it is only for a few seconds in this few second I am truly happy and I do not think she knows that but she probably does not like me the way I like her and that is the reason I do not want to confess my feelings to her because I know this will just end up in she not texting me or not answering my messages and I think then I am done with everything. This might sounds stupid I know but she is the first girl I met ever to just like me how I am and not to look a certain way and this feeling is just awesome I felt like there was some hope for me. And I said to myself before I was texting so much with her that I am not getting into a state like I am but I just could not resist I could not belive how perfect she is and that brought me to the point where I maybe cannot live without her and that is even more terrifying because I know on some day I will fuck everything up and Ill completely lose her. I could type so much more but idk I think that was long enough. Oh btw I am 17 and I know this just could be phase but like I said I cannot take this anymore and I do not know what to do now. If you are read this till here i want to thank you. I love it to talk about my feelings and this place is probably the best for it.And yes that was all know thx and bye I think I am done with everything,Suicidal
11576,11596,I wish I could kill myself without causing pain to those close to me. What a piece of shit I am for wanting something so bad that would in turn devastate my parents and wife so deeply. Conflicted,Suicidal
11589,11609,I am tired of living. its the endless shit that comes with it shit parents shit boyfriends shit friends shit income shit schools. cannot even cry without sending myself into a panic attack that looks like I am seizing. so I am killing myself there is a million reasons for me to live but i do not care life is eternal suffering. I am so tired that i cannot even type why i truly want to kill myself oh well either live and suffer or die happy,Suicidal
11594,11614,A little reminder for self and maybe for you too to take a deep breath do not stop breathing be alive. Life awaits for you and your adventure,Suicidal
11599,11619,I cannot take it anymore . I kill myself tonight . I am extremely depressed because nobody will draw me naked .,Suicidal
11600,11620,People always say how only you are in charge of your life and shit but that is just objectively not true. You need other people to do things like hire you befriend you love you. there is only so much you can do for yourself. I was the youngest child in a homeschooled family with 3 other kids and by the time I popped out my parents had pretty much stopped caring about what happened. I spent most of my childhood alone or hanging out with the characters I created in my head. All of my sisters and family members are constantly talking about how I missed out. Missed out on the fun things they used to do missed out on having a dad who gave a shit about me missed out on most people even giving half a shit. I have been so starved of human love and affection that I recently realized I was in love with one of my characters. How pathetic is that? I am like Lars and the Real Girl but even more cringe. Relationships have never worked out for me platonically or otherwise. The only friends I can keep around are all hundreds of miles away and if they knew me in person they would probably leave too. I did everything right. Went to college got straight As for the almost decade I was there and yet I still cannot get a job that is not a scam keep any friends around or find someone who thinks I am worth more than just sex. I think I just grew up being socially fucked from being alone all the time as a kid that there is no coming back from it. I have been praying to gods that I do not believe exist to give me just one thing that will make life worth sticking around for for over a year and there is absolutely nothing for me here on this earth. Every day and every rejection I get from the outside world just pushes me further and further into my head and the paracosm I have created there. I know it is not realistic but I hope that death brings me there. I see nothing in this life worth living for. What is left? Working slave labor hours to be underpaid and struggle to pay for a 1 bedroom apartment for the rest of my life until global warming fucks up the earth so bad there are endless wars and famines? what is the point??? I am done.,Suicidal
11611,11631,I have severe anxiety and OCD and today I let them get the best of me. I looked through his phone. A huge breach of trust. I hate myself. I hate that I did it. I hate my mind. A lot of me thinks it would be better if I just killed my self so I will not make my emotional problems and baggage other peoples problems. I am on the edge right now wondering who even benefits from my existing. I caused my fianc so much emotional distress that he relapsed on opiates. I do not think Ill ever be able to forgive myself. Hes been clean going on 8 months.,Suicidal
11618,11638,alt account for obvious reasons.I have been suicidal for the past 23 years at first it was very mild but now every day I wake up and look at the mirror the first thing I think of is how I do not want to be here anymore.I just cannot take it anymore this feeling of loneliness and despair is really getting to me and I honestly do not know why I am making this post just a rant I guess.I absolutely hate every part of the day except for one part will not describe it because it is personal my friends always make fun of me due to me liking a girl my voice looks and probably more.I really do not think anything is going to get better and honestly I have some early plans of committing suicide but I do not think that I have the guts to actually do it.that is it thanks for reading. I really did not want to make this post but here I am,Suicidal
11634,11654,This is not a sad thing I have come to realize. I am not sad about not wanting to exist. I am indifferent. I have no desire to participate in life.I care for nothing I do not care about anything.I am on here because I am not sure what to do about it. I wish I could voluntarily donate my body to science so I could contribute to humanity in some way.I am not cut out for this life and nor do I care to be.Apathy is the only thing I feel. My life holds no meaning or value and I have made peace with that.I wish there was a simple way to go. If there was Id be gone long ago. I do not have the desire to exist anymore.,Suicidal
11640,11660,I do not want to bore anyone with the details of how it came to this but two friends of mine turned on me in a truly humiliating and nasty way using something I never actually did as an excuse they said I fat shamed an actor's girlfriend I did no such thing I have struggled with EDs myself I do not do that shit to other people several years ago.This was traumatic and frightening it just cane out of absolutely nowhere. They accused me of manipulating then by saying I felt suicidal that I was fucking mean and horrible person. Just imagine being flayed alive while people scream insults at you and you get the idea.The only reason I never killed myself at that time was because my mum was recovering from some major surgery so I moved back home for a bit. But none of this has ever truly gone away. They were able to keep track of my movements which perplexed me because I blocked every account of theirs I was away of.TlDr one of them had an account I discovered by accident. The one she proudly proclaims herself an MD. A doctor took part in this bullshit. 1I also found out I was not the only one the mainhead bully had done this two. that is what motivated me to expose her and warn others......well that plan failed worse then a second hand condom. Nobody wanted to know. They did not care. She was nice and polite to them so I must be a liar. It really does feel like fucking high school. Everyone loved the main bully too...until she finally fucked up and they kicked the shit out of her. It just makes me feel I have had enough. The world is cruel does not give a single shit about any of us. My dad is trying to persuade my mum to kick me out even though he does not live with us ffs. I have nothing and nowhere to go. it is really feeling like the end of the line.Apologies for incoherence I took a load of codeine and valium before writing this so it may make no sense. Nobody Cares About The Bullies Who Drove Us Here,Suicidal
11653,11673,I am really tried and it feels like nobody actually caresi actually tried to talk about it with my friend but she do not really into it. today i got yelled by my boss she said that I am like the worst employee she ever had. lazy unmotivated do not want to do anythingand there is also was my coworkers who even worse that me but she was only talking about me. I am really feel like i cannot handle it. i was abused by my parents and now by my boss and i really tired. i do not want to live this live i do not want to work i just want piece but everyday proves me that it can be worse i just want to die and that is all i know I am not actually coming suicide but it feels like the only one option right now it stop feel this way to stop feel like there is something missing so i can actually be happy i reallly tired felling like there is something wrong with me and I am also a little bit tipsy and smoking but it the only one thing that help me finally feel happy I am just really tired,Suicidal
11664,11684,I have been struggling with constant testicular pain since January. Unreliable doctors have been throwing drugs at me that have offered no relief. One antibiotic caused an allergic reaction that had me bedridden for about a month. One day the urologist says I am completely fine the next day I am pissing blood. I feel so incredibly alone. Every ambition and hobby I have had has been blown away by this bullshit. Whenever I begin to feel slightly better some new symptom or issue appears out of thin air. My parents are psychotic and because even more problems. I get that I am lucky enough to be better off than a lot of people. But the pain is keeping me from doing anything I used to enjoy. At 16 years old chronic health issues are making me want to kill myself.,Suicidal
11677,11697,I am feeling lately really like taking my life. I am diagnosed with BPD and I just feel like I cannotdo not want to keep living a life where I am forced to live with the actions I sometimes commit due to my trauma induced addled mind. Actions like exploding in uncontrollable rage with those that I love over minor or percieved slights including yes my beloved house animals. I feel like a dirty creature that grew up only observing violence and chaos and now I am struggling futilely to be anything but that with little to no success. I came accross another post that perfectly describes the feeling inside of me and read it all and did not notice up until the end that it was not actually written by someone with BPD but rather someone whom was apparently deeply hurt by a former lover that has BPD. I started reading what seemed like a poem written by someone is account of the mental illness and kept reading further to see how they have overcome their struggles only to be met with gut wrenching disappointment at the sentiment that the pwBPD has little to no possibility of bettering themselves and the story in itself has a terribly unhappy ending. I no longer want to be a source of pain fear oppression to those around me. I want to stop it all. And yes I most certainly AM in therapy. I am in DBT. I have a therapist psychiatrist. Medications just got out of my 14th acute hospitalization about 2 months ago. Been going to therapy since I was 17 and now I am 27. I try. I really really have been. But I still slip. And slipping for me is not just being late a lot lazy distracted having depressed days not keeping up with my exercisediet etc although I do experience that as well my main slips that make me want to take my life are I get arrogant jealous controlling I snap and get loud and violent I temporarily lose empathy and have the incapacity to be conscious about other's perspectivesright to have differing views etc. I feel like I am a cesspool of toxicity and feel so incredibly alone and ashamed of whowhat I am. Link to the post I referenced Feel like I am Parasitic Evil and Unfixable,Suicidal
11701,11721,why is it seen as bad if i want to take my own life? i do not see what importance i make being alive not being happy i just do not want to be here and am becoming more and more emotionally unstable. i just do not want to be here anymore but do not want to leave without word or explanation why,Suicidal
11733,11753,So first off I am a piece of shit human being. I have never been in trouble or been in jail but I am not a good person. My family excommunicated me. I do not have any friends except one and he is unable to help me. I fucked off my twenties 33 now did not apply myself dripped out of college at 2627. Lived with my Dad till he passed in Jan 2019. He was my best friendconfidant would call him everyday if I was out of town for work. A week after he died I was fired. So I took my dog Suka sold everything I could and went out on the road. Ended up in Oregon. While surrounded by natural beauty and people who genuinely wanted to know me I just could not as I was in another dimension emotionally. Asjed for help form my Godmother in Arkansas. That was a mistake. Was literally asked by her a social worker btw if I was a retarded.... So because I have fucked over my family so many times nobody believes that I wantworking on to be better. Back on the road.Ended up in Tulsa. Worked at a call center. Call center helps me get a place. Pandemic happens. Stuck in apartment being yelled at by people on a constant basis. I quit my job. Lose apartment. Asked for help from a cousin. Cousin has a roommate with three other dogs. Said roommate is a veteran. During a family get together with cousin in law coming back from deployment the dogs get in a fight. Veteran roommate tackles my dog old Shepard Husky mix and less than a month later I had to have him out down. So in the last two and half years I lost two of my best friends. I lost everything. I live out of my truck once again. I have reached out to people but it is been a no go from them. One of them is still thinking about it but it is most likely going to be a no. I keep being told that I am worthy of a happy life. But everytime I work towards that the rug is pulled. Or I do something very stupid like quit a job. I am not worthy. The talents I thought I had have dried up. The relationships I thought I had have dried up. My patience has dried up. I am just screaming in a void. I do not have anywhere to go. I have nothing and I feel like nothing. No spouse no kids no dog no life. What am I doing here? I will not call the hotline. I do not want to be incarcerated. Because I am already living in a self made prison. I just cannot do this anymore. I do not want to this anymore. There is no hope for me. Right now I am just trying to decide between the revolver or the shotgun at this point. But I will probably do another self sabotage before it all ends. cannot do this anymore,Suicidal
11752,11772,I am 23f so tired of being alive. Saying I have had a tough couple of years is an understatement. Many family members have died from suicide or drug overdose sexual assaults and just day to day misery. I have become addicted to drugs one of which being heroin. But it does not make me happy. Nothing makes me happy. My boyfriend says I make his life miserable I know I make everyone is life miserable. I am just a self centered bitch. My mom was just diagnosed with MS and she should not have to deal with me. I know my death would hurt her a lot but I am so so tired. I want it to be over,Suicidal
11755,11775,I am 16. so i have no future prospects. nor do i plan on continuing my education or working towards a career. is it in my best interest to kill myself? question,Suicidal
11768,11788,I am currently working 10min walk from home so I walk there everyday. The thing is I am back at my grandma's in a small city in Brazil and here there are soooo many stray dogs and cats on the streets at least half of them in awful conditions looking like they are about to die at any moment either too skinny or with a lot of ugly bruises.I have to see that everyday therefore I cry everyday and want to end this everyday 4 times a day the street I walk to have lunch has the worst dog of them all he is barely breathing supper skinny and there is nothing I can do. I lived here when I was a teen and it was so hard. When I moved out I was so relieved to leave all of this hurt behind but now I am back and details aside I cannot really leave.Does anyone have any suggestions for me to feel less like shit being that I cannot help them because I am goddamn poor and barely have time and money for my sick cat at home. I cannot quit my job. there is no way to get to work without bumping into those poor creatures and relieving my trauma. I will only be able to afford therapy by September.it is hard and I do not see any solution I am actually skeptical about anyone helping me with some kind of ideasolution but I do not really see an alternative I am hoping for the best. Feel suicidal daily and cannot really change things in order to be ok right now. Wonder if there is anything I can do to feel better even if I am in a shitty situation can someone help?,Suicidal
11782,11802,I need help but do not with what. I have not had that innate want to live for quite a while and just living right now takes all of me. I am nauseous from anger and resentment most of the time and nothing drives me. I have never made plans for 'that' but today I just feel so empty. Like the hollow husk that held what was left of me fell off. I cannot grasp onto a single want that I have to be here. Everything I have is someone else's wish for me. I am supposed to go to college soon but it honestly sounds like another four years of somehow drowning further. I do not want that. I just want to be happy but Everytime I am I feel guilty like I am doing a disservice to those who cannot smile. I go between hating the world and hating myself and because of that I cannot cope anymore. It feels like there is this big barrier between me and everyone around me. Like you tell 100 people to talk to me today and I would still feel alone. I am sorry for anyone who has to read this I just wanted to tell someone because I feel that talking to anyone else would just be a burden on them. I hope you all have great days and thank you for the ear. I do not know what to do.,Suicidal
11789,11809,Cw abuse and suicide attemptI guess I just need somewhere to vent. I have struggled with suicidal ideation since I was about eleven and because I never attempted my parents never cared no matter how intense they got. So I gave up on it and just kept it to myself.I got some help later in life and was diagnosed with PTSD from peer and familial abuse and BPD. I also struggle a lot with my parents trying to throw me to the rocks with coping with my autism. Every therapist and help I have been provided always was the mind set that I was not suicidal enough. it is hard for me to keep my mind from splitting so often when it went this route I just dropped that provider. I am not paying you to pretend you care you know?Then it happened.The stress of my failing writing career failing marriage and relationships imploded last night and I just OD'd. it is a blur but I did not really have a suicide note or plan. I was in the hospital since I was found out pretty fast. Unfortunately since it turned out to be non fatal medication the hospital visit was not very helpful and now I feel like a complete dumbass. I really should have done more research and gotten something fatal. It was just what I had on time.What I am surprised about is my indifference about surviving. For a bit I did fade in and out but I was fully aware that on the off chance I did actually die I did not care. The doctors kept trying to figure out why I did not and still do not feel guilt. I am not upset I survived. I just do not fucking care. I refused to be put in a pysch ward. I have sensory overload issues and I have heard enough shit what they do to autistic people in my state.Maybe because I am in a vicious cycle of barely hanging on I knew it was time. I do not remember everything and I do not want advice. I also do not want fake positivity of the oh it will get better type.I got enough from professionals. I really do not need to hear or be guilt tripped into why I was wrong for finally being provoked into it. Therapy is in the talks but I need to find a good fit for someone who is okay with who I am. Because there is not a lot of people that like me very much understandably honestly. I am often treated poorly by others. I do not understand healthy relationships and now due to financial reasons I can only hope therapy does not drag my fiances into the ground because I have to go if I want to make the attempt to be better. So I did it,Suicidal
11833,11853,I tried to suffocate myself the other day and of course I could not succeed. I just feel like a worthless burden to my friends and family. they would be better off without me I am sick and tired of being alive,Suicidal
11847,11867,I am really here all because 17 years ago two idiots were horny and wanted to fuck...what a sad reality. Wow...,Suicidal
11873,11893,I have been trying to tune into how i feel more lately and i cannot stop thinking about one thing in particular it is usually assumed that suicidal folks are more likely to attemptcommit when they are at the lowest point in their life and i mean it does seem logical. but what I have also noticed is that when I am at my lowest i do not really think about it and instead i think more about how i wish the pain was over and similar things. but when it gets a little better and when I am back to not doing things on autopilot that is when i start thinking about it. and it causes kind of a dissonance because i feel better and the situation is better but at the same time i want to just end it all more than ever. like for example I am done with school for the summer i got a job offer recently i have not had a flare up in weeks got a chronic condition I have made a lot of progress on the book I am currently writing and I have been catching up on a lot of shows and movies long story short i have a lot of distractions. but at the same time i feel like absolute shit and every time i go to sleep i hope i do not wake up and when i do wake up i think about how much i want this to end.is this how other people feel too? how do you deal with that? usually the goto advice is to find distractions but what if distractions are what is making it worse? when distractions actually make it worse,Suicidal
11883,11903,I just checked my account I have less then 200 so I guess tomorrow will likely be my last day on this earth.I do not know why I am making this post guess I am feeling emotional today so many years of not crying and now my eyes start to water up now. I remember as a kid thinking if all goes to crap I can kill myself.Idk if I even feel bad I just feel so disappointed I myself because I bought myself to this I had so many opportunities to be successful or happy. But for whatever reason I did not go for any of them. Guess its only fair that I ended up here I know the kind of pos I am instead I hurt people around me to the point where in the last 9 months nobody has contacted me.It was my birthday last month nobody messaged me I am not saying this for sympathy because I definitely do not deserve it just to show I am pretty dead to the world soon I will actually be dead Tomorrow rant idk,Suicidal
11897,11917,I have noticed with each period I getmaybe its hormones the feeling to off myself increases my intrusive thoughts get way more intense and frequent. Plus I also panic more quickly etc.My birthday is soon and all my brain can think of is how it will be the first time in years I will not be celebrating it with my ex how I will not get a happy birthday from her. And all my mind keeps saying is just kill yourself to avoid it how does it make any sense kill myself to avoid the panic the worry the thoughts? Sounds great but I will not do it. That still will not stop me from feeling like I have to for the next few days. Its going to be another struggle for this period of the month.I just wish we really did not celebrate birthdays anyways has always been terrible for me. Never had many friends growing up so it was always stressful. I really hate it. But happy rotation around the sun day you guys. Hope you all continue to rotate with me. Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day. Another rotation,Suicidal
11918,11938,A ramble sorry. I have no friends no family no life no job no hobbies no money and most importantly as of right now no health insurance to get better to possibly get help to fix myself to have these things. If I cannot get therapy or medication or psychiatric help then nothing matters. Everyone throws around get therapy when someone is struggling but not everyone fucking can so stop telling people that its infuriating. A huge debt and hospital bill will probably make me want to die more so? I am paranoid all the time I cannot stop analyzing every single thing to death. I do not think right anymore. thought negatively for so long I believe it. I do not think people can change I try and try and I keep going back to how I was. It has to be untrue that you can get better because I have done so much and I am not. I am miserable I am sad all the time. I do not care about life. do not care about even finding something enjoyable to do because I just do not care. I do not care about any of the things everyone else cares about family career hobby blah blah blah I do not believe in purpose or meaning because we are just a bag of cells some hyper intelligent apes that just run around a world that tells you how to live and defines you based on looks money success. I am extremely self conscious and insecure I have tried every single thing to fix this and actually for once like myself but you cannot do that if you actually do not like yourself can you force yourself to like someone else? No. So why should I force myself to like myself when I literally cannot because I am hideous and disgusting and getting older. We used to not live until we were 30 before modern medicine and such but now we are prolonged to live until we are seen as worthless. Ageism is a thing. I have suffered with anorexia for 8 years I was abused and neglected as a child and then abused again at 19. I am 22. I miss being young as well I hate that I am 22 and I do not want to age anymore I rather die young than die old pissing myself in my diaper and being alone. I never leave my house I hate people so very much. They seem selfish dangerous and I cannot relate to their minds because they operate correctly and mine is going a million miles a second. I think deeply about thinking deeply. I am scared and anxious so much from everything and trauma its physically effecting me. I am fatigued and sleep and act like I am sick. Maybe I am sick but cannot afford any medical care!!! I hate my body face hair and skin. I hate my personality my voice my thoughts and thinking patterns. My family is gone or have been the reason of how fucked up I am. My friends hate me and moved on years ago. I only have a SO and they are why I am here today. But my insecurities and jealously is ruining that too. I am not good enough in so many ways I am so miserable its showing up everywhere and again there is no help for me. I cannot even afford sliding scale help or any of the fucking rest. My sleep is not even restful as nightmares haunt me daily and make me wake up so so so sad. God I wake up sad every day. My body hurts my heart is broken. I just do not want to live here anymore but I really do not want to hurt my SO but I have been so strong for so fucking long just for my SO but I cannot take it anymore I cannot do this anymore and I cannot breathe because of how much I hurt. Nothing can help at this point I am seriously too far gone. I cannot function at all I cannot socialize. I do not want to live poor anymore because I am too anxious for work I do not want to live. I do not want to die either I really fucking am scared and terrified of death but the pain I feel the aching dull feeling of despair in my stomach is just too fuckingr much right now. I am safe right now but I am writing this out because I lurked this sub for so long and I wanted to write 10 of what is going on and figure out what to fucking do from here. I do not think I can keep going for another year. Nothing can be said,Suicidal
11938,11958,I have no motivation I am constantly stressed and I do not want a future. I am also too scared to step into the world. I hate doing things a first time and will avoid it so much. I' constantly in my own way and I am tired and have the feeling that no one underdtands that I do not WANT to be like this. I cannot control this. I am trying to push myself but I just want to quot existing. It would save me so much stress and sadness. I am so scared of failure and disappointing people,Suicidal
11996,12016,Why fucking why do we have to keep suffering like what in the world have We done that was so bad. I just want to feel better I want to feel better and be able to accept that too but I cannot seem to. I am at my wits end I am just so incredibly sick and tired of it I just want my life back or a life back. Its that or out done finished cannot bear it feel like every morning I am losing and I feel awful for that because I know there is people much worse than me who are desperately clinging to life. How bloody dare I but I just cannot help it I cannot and I want to I want to be better and not just for me. Oh ffs sake here we go again the fight begins. Here we go again I guess for another anxiety fuelled day fuck sake one morning I just want to wake up and feel settled and calm and normal.,Suicidal
12009,12029,Plan A Run off alone to the city wait for nighttime to get kidnapped then whatever happens happens. Optionally wear the most revealing clothes possible.Plan B Attempt to run away again but get more physical with cops. Hopefully physical enough they just shoot me. Optionally have a weapon of some sort.Plan C Brutally reject some incel so he may kill me himself.Motive constant thoughts of being a financial andor emotional burden to parents due to autism more specifically extreme meltdowns that become part of plan A. In addition I do not believe unconditional love exists and I do not understand why they still love me after everything I have done. I even started openly looking for groomers again even that does not work Well fuck there is a plan B and C now,Suicidal
12027,12047,I quite my job hosting at a restaurant because the pay was not worth the stress for those who care be kind to the front line employees. Been interviewing for almost a month now in my industry and every time it is the same we are sorry but we going in another direction. Fuck me i cannot interview to save my life. i was miserable at my last job I am miserable job hunting I am tired of failing and feeling worthless i just want to die. I feel like a fucking failure,Suicidal
12035,12055,I have lived in my own apartment for a couple months now and I do not know if its because I am depressed or if every young homeowner goes through this. But my apartment is disgusting. there is trash everywhere I have bags full of trash and I just do not have the energy or motivation to take care of it. I barely have the motivation to take care of my cat who is my world but believe me hes taken care of it just might take me an extra half hour. I am very good at procrastinating I will lay in bed all day and it really bothers me. I hate living in filth and I want to do something about it but I just do not have the energy. Does everybody go through this in the first monthMonths of owning their own place? Well I grow out of this phase? I really want to make this a comfortable place but I am so tired. I feel bad that my cat also has to run around and play in trash because I am lazy Home owningliving alone,Suicidal
12045,12065,I just wish it could end. All the pain. Next year is going to be horrible. I am going to try my fucking hardest to make friends and ill fail. I have no relationship and I am never going to get one. I am just so fucking pathetic. If i do not make friends by the end of 2021 I am going to kill myself. I just want to die so muchhhhh please why am i here I have 0 people irl anymore and its my fault,Suicidal
12052,12072,I failed out of college. Community college because I was too dumb to start applying to colleges right out of highschool. I am actually pretty smart which only makes it more embarassing. All of my friends either went to university or graduated from community college by this point and want nothing to do with me because of how embarassing it is that i failed out. I cannot join the military as I am a type one diabetic was born with it as an autoimmune disease. I have no fucking future at all. No chance at life. I have no friends anymore. My family is beyond fucked up. Dad's a drunk and mom is a schitzo. I hate myself beyond words. I should have been a better friend. I have been such a terrible friend all of my life. does anyone else have a similar story? I am such a nobody and I have no chance to change it because I ruined my life already. College dropout who feels like there is absolutely no future for myself,Suicidal
12062,12082,What about the selfishness of those of you who did nothing to help while I suffered just so you would not be saddened by my death? All because I succumb to my mental disorder... somehow that makes me selfish suddenly despite suffering for all of you my whole life. Fuck you all Why is it seen as selfish to suffer for decades on behalf of the feelings others have for me and I suddenly break and decide I want to commit sui?,Suicidal
12065,12085,I do not know what I am going to write here. I just need to express my dumb ugly thoughts. I kept hitting myself I the head this not ing I have been crying ever night and morning lately and it hurts physically Anxiety has taken a hold of me. And it is all because I am such a fucked up loser that everyone dislikes but no one knows why they dislike me.I am tired I am tired of the loneliness the self hatred and my lack of any confidence. But how can I be confident I cannot. I am hideous like a clown. I am horny but I cannot possibly imagine someone wanting to be with me physically.So I work and it is exhausting and when I am done for the day I lay down to recover and when I am done I have to get ready for work again.I do not have the time or energy to invest in improving my life because I have to work you do not hate working I just it is tiring. And I am losing touch with the thing used to like to do.I have no time so self live no sex no lovers no time to get it togther. And you can feel myself coming apart.I am dying choked to death on unresolved emotions other humans comments sweet dreams and a mirror that makes me cry.Someone hold me hold me tight and whisper. I got you just for an hour just for a moment someone else please hold me togther and see my crying pain. Becoming undone alone in the shadows is being choked under water screaming A mushy splashy brain sauce,Suicidal
12081,12101,My grandparents are going away for 9 days and I am going to stay at their house and watch their dog. If no miracles happen in those 9 days When they return I will reach out to someone to get something I can overdose on if I cannot I will hang. I cannot do this anymore and a lot of people say its worth it to hold on but I am really not. I am just so alone and broken right now too I am sorry for anyone that has to read this post. If this is my last post I really hope you all find happiness and a way out of your suffering. If I could give my life to someone more deserving I would. I wish. I wish I was just never here. I wish something could just take my life away I have made my decision,Suicidal
12097,12117,Whenever I go for my nightly walks I pray that her car swerves into me and just ends this unnecessary suffering that I cannot control I dream of a painless death,Suicidal
12103,12123,I hope you can forgive me for all the things I did not become I am sorry I am too tired to say much but I am sorry,Suicidal
12123,12143,there is no purpose to living it is all just distractions constantly until you die I am convinced no one actually enjoys anything and they just tell themselves they are just lying to themselves it is so depressing and it is all I constantly think about recently I just wish my life had some sort of meaning and someone actually understood.I wish someone could help me find some meaning in anything but no one will even engage in me with this because they do not accept that I am logically right and just always tell me that it is not meaningless then when I ask what meaning it has they do not answer.Life is meaninglessLife is pointlessThere's no point in this torture I am constantly going throughThere's no enjoyment to be had from anything in this worldI want to die can someone just give my life some sense of meaningI'd be so surprised if anyone even cared enough to respond after all what are you going to say to me?I have so many problems with existing and it just is not fun to live with I do not know what I am supposed to do I am so close to the edge of doing something self distruptive and ruining all my relationships with my family the only people who even know I exist.I am sorry please just talk to me I do not know what to do anymore. Ultimately life is meaningless and just a bunch of distractions and I have no one to talk to no reason to do anything,Suicidal
12132,12152,Graduated for a year and 50 applications later amp rejections later and still no job. Heck I even submitted applications to retail stores and none has come back to me so far. I am at the brink of ending it all. I wasted four years clinicals amp volunteering of my life just to end up in crippling debt with no job and possibly getting kicked out by my parents for being unemployed... I cannot do this anymore. They do not believe in mental health they do not believe my struggles they do not believe in me... I just want to die... Painless if possible... drowning in depression amp debt,Suicidal
12133,12153,i should be happy that i have as many friends as i do. but being the 'second choice' to one person makes me have a breakdown and start working out my suicide? great.i guess this feeling will probably pass like it always does but it just feels so intense right now. all things considered I am in a better situation than most people. i wish i had a 'normal' brain. i wish it did not feel like my closest friend is leaving me when all they did was be closer with someone who is not me. this all feels dumb. i wish i came up with reasonable solutions. i wish i never learned that suicide was even something a human being could do so i stop jumping to it at the moment of every conflict in my life. this all feels so irrational of me.I will take daily casual suicidal thoughts like i used to have over these intense I would do it right now if i had a gun. moments twice a month. this is the first time it is actually been spurred by something i can 'blame' but it still feels dumb to me. i should feel lucky,Suicidal
12140,12160,We are not speaking for a month due to a break we are taking. Impossible for me to know whether we will stay together or not. In the meantime I am preparing myself for a breakup even if I have some faith in the outcome. I have fought hard to reassure him about continuing together but he is still lost about what decision to make. Beyond this I am afraid of a lifetime where I will never know if he is truly okay.Even if for a day it is easy to think he is not for me I go to sleep crying because I feel the thought is cruel. He has been nothing but loving from the start and we were happy together. Our families liked each other. I love his so much. A few months ago I found out he has been suicidal for a long time. He told me his dark thoughts and it broke my heart. He did not want to talk about it and was upset that the whole thing came up because it triggered him. We rarely ever fought but now he says he cannot trust me. Now I pray to God for the first time so he gathers strength to overcome his depression because there is nothing else I can do.He continues to love me and want this relationship but fears it might do him more harm than good. I want to do anything I can to prove I am strong enough for this and that I can be his support. I am afraid of what happens to him if he gives this up which I understand is arrogant. There is no way to claim I am what he needs. But we thought we were going to be married one day. I am scared he is pushing me away. Viewed optimistically the end of the relationship could diminish potential triggers and give him the space to focus 100 on himself his way. All of my friends say I need to look out for myself right now. But what on Earth could my strength be for other than him when he was the first to make life beautiful for me. Because of him I overcame my own depression and became so strong. I think I would be okay I just would hate to settle for someone else. There is no knowing why he is depressed and what stops him from trusting me. Maybe he has some secret I would suspect about gender. I would be with him no matter what. Anyone with advice it is very welcome! I want to be there for him so badly I am just not sure what else to do but be patient I have done everything I can. I have cleared up misunderstandings. And again maybe a breakup is just what makes sense. But this came out of nowhere. I trust he will find his way even if without me. I found out my boyfriend is suicidal and he thinks he wants to split up.,Suicidal
12157,12177,So. Gf leaving me. Practically already ex but looking for another place to leave before ending officially for good. No job. Nothing good really happening. Considering going to a psychologist but cannot feel like that would happen since I am usually depressed when it is good but at least now I have lots of reasons to be depressed about. Still hanging. No pun intended. Just feel like there is no actual reason for me to mind dying or to continue alive. I do not feel alive.Just wanted to vent a little. If anyone reads this please write anything below...just to know that someone out there is reading. I will probably look for a good psych...I feel dragged to the ground more and more...and do not want that I want to be cremated. Not really suicidal ...but yeah?,Suicidal
12171,12191,Work makes me depressed because it reminds me that I will be fighting tooth and nail till the day I die for a wage that cannot get close to affording rent anywhere.I am not affraid of work I do not want everything handed to me I just want to live. I just want to be able to stay warm and eat without worrying if I have the money. I want to be able to buy food or necessities without equating the price to how many therapy appointments that was.I just want to live. I want to want to live. I want to feel like I am not walking into a trap.I am tired of seeing articles about what to do if your job makes you depressed as if there is not some bigger problem going on. I want to not be exhausted all the time. I want to have energy despite having chronic health issues.I want... to feel like I deserved these things... Being an adult is a scam,Suicidal
12173,12193,1. I am going to be working at a fucking pizza place forever because I am too much of a loser to hold down a real job. Every other job I have walked out of or gotten fired from because I do not want to spens my life working.2. So what do I do instead of working? Do I work on my hobbies? My relationships? No I just drink. Or smoke pot. All fucking day. I never used to be this bad before. I wastes my entire day today and I probably will tomorrow.3. The one fucking thing I want to do which is play the drums I never fucking do. People think I practice all the time. I used to. Now I waste all of my time drinking and smoking. Why? Why cannot I have this one simple fucking thing on this miserable planet? Why? 4. Relationships? No. I will not even fucking write about it. But it is not his fault. I am the one destroying everything. I am the liability. I do not blame him. 5. I will never change. I just will not. I can say I will but I will not. Tomorrow will be the same. I will make the same choices. I will feel angrier and angrier the more days I waste. who is ruining my life? Me. Who needs to die? Me. I am responsible for this entire shit show of a life that I flushed down the toilet. Did I ever have a chance? Was I born doomed? God fucking damn it I wish I could just die already. I cannot believe I am stuck here for 50 or 60 more years,Suicidal
12195,12215,I fantasize about my suicide constantly. No one gives a fuck about me so why keep going. what is the point of living a meaningless life. I get no joy from anything. No friends nothing. Its pathetic. How I ever got a girlfriend once was some cosmic shift in the universe. did not take long for me to absolutely ruin it. I literally have no one to call that will listen. I tell my brother my life sucks and he just sends me a picture of my nephew. Why cannot you just support me. If I owned a gun I would just do it tonight. I should just do what that guy in sunshine cleaning did. But some bullets go to a gun shop and load it and off myself there. Or I would pay someone to do it. Hire a house painter on myself. Call the police on myself. I am a coward. Will just continue to walk this shitty life alone. What an absolute miserable existence. I am 35 years old and have nothing to show for it. No one knows I am here so no one will care when I am gone. No one gives a fuck about me,Suicidal
12214,12234,My life for the past few years has been nonstop suffering. Just make it all stop. Please. I cannot fucking do this anymore. I want to die.,Suicidal
12216,12236,So I guess this is it. I live with my grandma were about 2000 behind on the bills and she has no idea. Everything is getting shut off on Monday. The cats are starving just got a call today saying I did not get a job I applied for two weeks ago. I have been turned down for multiple jobs over the past six months and I am at the end of my rope lol. I actually went to Walmart about an hour ago and picked up some nylon rope for the weekend.Tonight I am writing my letters and making a mixtape tomorrow I am throwing all my stuff out and wiping my devices Saturday night I am ending it all. I have been nothing but a failure and a disappointment and honestly do not deserve to live. I cannot face my grandma on Monday when the lights go out.Thanks Reddit for everything you are the only reason I have made it this far. Stay safe and hug someone today. Joining the 27 club,Suicidal
12229,12249,And I lost my favorite tie clip. Afterwards I went to a barbershop numb alone did not think much. And got the shortest hair I have had in years. The new look is shit I miss my middle part from before. I feel like all the life journey I have been on and will have is just a gradual process of losing and becoming more immune to pain. I have had a few attempts in the past but somehow I still want to hold on to it and see maybe one day just one day in a few decades life would be different and I can be genuinely happy. I really hope I can make it. I attended my moms wedding today. I know she does not even like the groom because she told me before.,Suicidal
12232,12252,I am struggling I do not think I contribute to my family in a positive way at all I am wonderful which drug I could take that could end this turmoil the quickest I just want to disappear. Why am I even here,Suicidal

I hope my helium will arrive fast. I wonder what others will do when I am gone.... I finally ordered helium,Suicidal
12305,12325,I have planned everything tested out some stuff to see if it could work but I am actually scared to do it. I have decided that I will not tell my long distance boyfriend about it I will break up with him so that he will not feel guilty. Same with my online friend I am just going to block him...I know it sounds bad but it is going to be easier to forget me that way. I just cannot seem to do it though...I do not want to die alone while they think I am just an asshole and I am scared it will hurt a lot and I really do not want to end up in a mental hospital. That would be worse than dying it would be fucking hell for me... I am scared to do it,Suicidal
12316,12336,I hate everything around me I do not know if anyone else feels it but I feel contempt for everything everything tastes bitter to me. The only thing I can still stand to do besides Basic needs is to play and sing otherwise I want to blow everything up. my fear is of become a sociopath and do something stupid so I know I have to kill myself before this happens. A great contempt for the world and for life,Suicidal
12321,12341,Every time. Every fucking time. When I see my psychiatrist once a month and he asks me Any suicidal thoughts I lie through my teeth and have to bite on my back teeth hard as I gulp. I always take a sharp inhale afterwards and he just sighs man. He knows. He fucking knows. And he gives me this look man like Why are you even here? Do you even want to get better? Shit's getting old man I have to fight the urge to laugh,Suicidal
12333,12353,My father killed himself when I was only 4yo that was 36 years ago. I ended up having a rough childhood my mother did not have a stable job. The parents of my father abandon me and my mother. Luckily the family from my mother's side were there we managed. Living in a remote village helped I suppose.So economically my father's suicide was kind of crap.Through all my childhood the thing I hated the most was at the beginning of the school year when teachers would hand over questionnaires or would ask in the class what do you parents so?. When it was out loud I would get really sad. I remember being so ashamed when I would answer my father is no longer alive and then the teacher would ask what did he die of? I would always lie about it.I always knew that he had killed himself. I remember going to the place where he poisoned himself and seeing the paramedics taking him into the ambulance. In the village there was a house that on the ground floor had a pub on the outside it had stairs going up to the first floor he just went to the pub ordered his last glass of wine came outside and sat on the steps halfway up the stairs and drank the poison a strong insecticide used in farming straight from the bottle.Some years later after completing primary school I went to middle school to get to school I would need to get a bus. To get to that bus I would walk about 1.5km 1mile each way every day. Now the fate of destine the bus stop. That bus stop was a meter way from those stairs so basically every day during 4 years I would walk to and from the exact place where I saw my father for the last time.To go to high school I would still need to walk to get a bus but that one was about 4km in the opposite direction there were lucky days when I would get a ride from someone. I endured all that cold and walks in the dark most of the 4km had no public lights so the winters were tough. Being really poor my clothes were always whatever people would give to my mother I even got a big bag of clothes from my first English teacher in mid school. I endured all that because I knew that life was shit but if I just stuck in school things would get better. Always had good grades I never had to study much things always kind of make sense and things like geography and literature... well those just sucked I did not see the point of learning something that was basically either memorize lots of simply assumptions of whatever writer was thinking hundreds of years back totally pointless to me.Although I had never had my own computer I self taught what I could from either computer magazines or from the only programming book available in the school library an old book on Pascal programming language. Back in the day access to a one of the four computers in the school library had to be booked in advance. While my colleagues would spend their time on mIRC I would try to learn whatever I could. One day I was sitting there just waiting for my turn and I realized that some teachers would also use those computers I started to wonder what would the teachers use the computer for. So in my allocated time I started writing a tiny computer virus not really a virus as it would not replicate itself anyways a spyware that would simply create a copy of every document and spreadsheet opened in those 4 computers this was around the end of the last year of my secondary school. And yes some teachers were writing the exams there. oh! now I remember I never deleted the little spyware.Anyways the point is despite the hard times I always had good grades. When I finished the secondary school I voluntarily joined the army well because I wanted to go. And incredibly those same questions would pop up what does your father do? what did he die of?... same feelings sadness and extreme shame of how my father died.Finished my time in the army got out and got a job and then another it was good to finally do not have the weight of those questions. But one day sitting in my shitty car I remembered something I had told myself when I was 8 when another secret traumatic event occurred I am going to study hard and get far from this place that village had only brought me pain and abuse. I decided to go to University and get something back out of all that self taught stuff about computers.I worked really hard and spent a year literally sustained on bread water and sugar. Would kill one or other animal andor fish but I had made the point to put aside as much money I could just in case. Past that year I entered the university and those damn questions were back what do you father do? How did he die?. Kept the lying accident. One day I had made friends with a girl and one night she was feeling really down her father had been having an affair and her mother had found out and the whole thing was pretty shitty. I took her to a remote place where we could just stay in the car and see the stars between the scattered clouds. And while just was telling me all that she let us out I wish I could just die I find that people that kill themselves are really brave. At that point I started to cry in silence the tears kept pouring down my face while she kept asking what happened. I then decided to just tell her in a very confronting tone you are a fucking idiot how can you say that people are brave for killing themselves? People that kill themselves never deserved anything that this world gave them. Understandably she yelled back Who gives you the right to speak to me like that?. And then for the first time Because my father killed himself when I was four he gave up and left me and my mother behind. I was only four and he simply walked away and was not there to protect me every time I needed. Brave is to face the hardship. So I do not want you to ever say that killing yourself is something brave think about the people you would leave behind how your decision would affect their lives. From that point on I never more felt ashamed to admit that my father was not brave enough to find an alternative path and took the easy way out.I ended up finishing my degree getting a nice few jobs. Every time I look back the main thing I always see if the void I have always felt. I decided to never have kids because I never wanted to not be there for them for any reason. I know that there are millions of people that have had much worst lives than I have I always been lucky I always chased that same luck. I am not brave I still avoid going back to that small rural village. I am not even living in that country anymore. I feel down lots of time and in the last couple of years I have been feeling more and more down really down questioning my existence and yes suicide crossed my mind. I do not want to kill myself and I will not if I die I do not mind but I will not kill myself. I have been feeling more and more the need to give up on everything and I will probably will. I will probably leave my job and everything behind and go away a couple of years to the middle of nowhere living on whatever I can.If you ever think about killing yourself please think about how that decision my affect the other people in your life. My father's suicide has always been a darkness in my life and it will always be. Death is not the only solution there are other ways to get isolation and away from everything and even in the far chance you come to the conclusion death is the only way out well then die giving your life in a meaningful action. Go kill poachers in Africa go fight terrorists go help people in natural disasters but please remember the people you leave behind. You will not be there when they need the most. my father killed himself,Suicidal

12386,12406,is anyone here knowledgeable in psychology? Hello,Suicidal
12404,12424,No matter if I am doing reasonably okay in the sense that I can do basic tasks if I ever see a photo of myself it ruins me completely. I saw a photo of me from a party and all I could think was how absolutely disgusting I am. I do not think I deserve to be around other people ruining their photos and just making everything ugly. I wish more than anything that I could get plastic surgery but I cannot afford it. Even if I could I do not think my face is salvageable. All of my features are just so damn ugly.I am an 18 year old woman and the only times I have even kissed people have been when we are both extremely drunk. Nobody has ever expressed any interest in me when we are sober. I wish I could be having relationships like other people my age are but I am just completely undesirable. I cannot blame anyone for not being attracted to me.I do not want to live when this is what life is for me. Please do not tell me any platitudes like you cannot be that ugly or there is someone for everyone etc. I am sick of people pretending. I am a waste of breath and space I cannot even work a minimum wage job because of my anxiety and I have gotten ridiculously bad help from the NHS for depression and anxiety. I hate being alive so so much and I wish I could just die quickly and painlessly. I hate my appearance so much and it makes living unbearable.,Suicidal

12459,12479,Hi all! I could really use some advise. Thank you in advance to those who comment. Longstoryshort I feel trapped in unfulfilling office jobs that do not align with who I am as a person. Every day I go through some sort of existential crisis and lately I have really been wondering what the purpose of life is. On top of this USA's economic and societal climate really makes me depressed. Jobs I would actually be happy with would not pay a livable wage. Cost of living is too damn high and greed is so rampant amongst corporationsrich people. Anyway I have been working in my professional career for about 7 years now but I still feel like a scared little girl when it comes to taking on responsibilities and talking to other people. All the information that comes my way at work does not stick. I do not have interest in retaining it and it is really starting to bite me in the butt. My career motivation is tanked and I feel very guilty about it I know this is not who I really I am... Seriously I can be a very driven and happy person! But especially lately I really just want to shut myself away. I want to quit but bills need to be paid!So my question is how do I get out of this rutt and find fulfillment? I have tried therapy antidepressants career coaches exercising and eating well. I have also changed jobs a couple times gone back to school for Master's etc. But over time I sink back to these bad feelings. How can I gain confidence in my job and skills? What will make me WANT to wake up everyday? I miss the feeling of the world is my oyster. The world is shit. Advise on Fulfillment?,Suicidal
12460,12480,a stereotypical skinny nerd smotheredstrangled someone to death in the backseat of a car this way in Astoria in 2014. The nerd and the victim were both 17 years old. But I am asking if it is normal for the lower bodies of nerds to be that strong. If a stereotypical nerd locked me in a reverse figure four headscissor with the intent on killing me like in the case I just mentioned would I be able to break the hold before I suffocated? I am not trained and average weight and height. What if he was just cutting off air not blood giving me 23 minutes before I pass out? In the case I mentioned his air was cut off causing him to suffocate. I am 20 female. If a stereotypical nerd wrapped his thighs around my neck and squeezed as hard as he could to strangle me would I be able to break free before I suffocated?,Suicidal

12624,12644,i am going through a lot in my life. my wife is struggling with mental health and no matter what I do it feels like nothing helps.I am leaning towards the idea of restricting my arms and legs and tying a plastic bag over my head.if I succeed I do not have to keep hurting like this and hurting everyone around me.if I do not I will not know how badly I was hurting I will be able to live without knowing how bad my depression is I will not be able to feel how disappointed everyone is with me. I will not know and I will not care. it is difficult to not feel like this is the only option.I am trying to get my wife psychiatric help. I am trying so hard.I have been avoiding my own doctors appointments for urgent things so that I can afford food. I feel like I am at the end of the rope.

12640,12660,I have been suicidal since I was 17. I was miserable. Always drinking self harming never being honest with my family or friends and always unhappy. They all found out eventually because I had to stay at a psych ward for 2 weeks in 2017. Fast forward to present day I meet the most incredible human being ever. We worked together and became friends. He understood me asked questions about my feelings stayed on the phone with me for hours late at night until 5 or 6am some nights. When I was talking or hanging out with him I had no worries and I was the happiest I have been since going to Disneyland when I was a kid.Only problem is I started to fall in love. He is taken so I kept it to myself. I tried to get over it and just be friends. Sometimes it would be worth it and other times it would hurt but I stuck through the pain because he is too important to lose. I do not talk to my family or any other friends like that. I have tried. Hes the only one I got besides my therapist. It got to be too much one night and I ended up confessing my feelings. He said we could still be friends. That was a week ago and he will not reply to any of my texts or calls. I am torn between giving him space and trying to fix this but it seems like he just needs time. I have been doing everything I can to distract myself. I feel empty. I cannot do this without him. A part of me is missing. I have barely spoke since this happened. I drink all the time smoking non stop. Anything to make me forget that I might have just fucked up the best thing for me. I cannot stop thinking about all the memories we were going to share. I feel destroyed. I miss him so much. do not tell me Ill find another friend one day because this friendship is different its once in a lifetime. my best friend is not talking to me and I just want to rot away.,Suicidal
12665,12685,This is my third try at finishing a University's school year and I cannot even complete my registration because I was supposed to receive codes but I have never received them I have called the University several times three different phone numbers but none of them answered. The University closes at 4.30 pm and then it will not be opened until late August so until then I cannot ask for help and registrations close today too. A second phase opens late August but I do not know if I could register myself during this phase. I do hope so and I hope that I will receive the codes before that. But somehow I know it will be a burning failure like usual. I am so stupid. So stupid. I will never do something of my life. If I cannot go to University this year I will fucking kill myself because this will be the second year where I do absolutely nothing. I feel unfit to find a job because I have no diploma apart from a literary baccalaureate that no one cares about and I have huge social anxiety and I stutter. And I am just dumb I am but an inconvenience to anyone around me. My entire existence is a failure,Suicidal

All I have got to do is work up the nerve to say to someone I am not ok I need help. But I feel like I cannot because Ill be seen as weak or Ill be ostracized more than I already am. But at this point that seems insignificant to the mental anguish I can no longer cope with I am ready to take that step. Ill give life another chance. I have come to a realization.,Suicidal

12847,12867,I remember hearing about this musician that got up on stage played an original song called 'Sorry for the Mess' and then shot himself in front of the audience. A politician shot himself on camera right after a press conference because his reputation had been attacked and he thought it would be best for his family if he were dead. Maybe he was right.My older brother had a friend named Ed when I was little. Ed lost his left arm in a motorcycle accident in his early 20s. He dealt with heroin addiction most of his life until he finally got himself cleaned up. He killed himself with car exhaust a couple years after that.I was told a man in my extended watched his mom set herself on fire to spite him. My parents knew a guy who watched his brother shoot himself in the head at least that one was an accident.I am going to die someday. I want it to mean something. I can either die in a car accident and go down as a life cut tragically short or I can pull the trigger myself and leave as one tiny ripple one more small voice in the back of someone is head saying Maybe this life we have built for ourselves is not worth the trouble maybe we fucked up. Maybe if we are lucky they will actually try to fix it instead of just waiting for something to change. Maybe they will be stronger than me. Sorry for the Mess,Suicidal

My kids'd suffer worse than I am if I have them. Narcissists will thrive in the shortterm and create a world even worse and more desolate than it needs to be. I want to fly into the earth until I meet it facefirst... it cannot be worth inhaling everyone is air now when it will be a commodity for my friends' children in the future. I am a leech on something already dying and I will fall to my death no matter how long I survive.

13086,13106,Thought checking into the hospital would help but it did nothing. All they did was put me on a horrid medication that gave me a horrifying reaction so I had to stop taking after a week. I was going to go to school this semester but unfortunately I have to be able to afford the payment for all my classes tomorrow and I am clean out of money. do not have a job do not have a skill do not have a future other than being a slave and wishing I could die everyday. I am just an angry demotivated piece of snot oozing my way down the walls of my room towards the rock bottom. I wish I could find a way to make money off of music but unfortunately that is nigh impossible to do for practically anyone so that is another dream fucked by the disgusting planet we live on. going to do some research and finally get myself some actual help by ending my pointless miserable existence. At this point it seems that is the only help I can stand to gain anymore. My life and everything I do and try is meaningless. Everything I put effort into fails. Every passion I have fades away. Every love I share is torn apart. I am sick of the rollercoaster I am sick of losing all the time. No more of this. I am gone.

13113,13133,Why is it telling me I am not allowed to post here?? Why,Suicidal
13213,13233,I will try to be concise and to the point. I was 7 when my parents divorced and my mother remarried. She had me and my brother from the first marriage. Two more children wit husband 2.I turned into a parent at age 7. I was constantly taking care of my siblings up until I was 16 when my brother and I moved in with our father. Regardless of who I was staying with I had to be a parent for my dysfunctional family. Always the good child. I never had a childhood my actions were not my own no we are my choices. Praise was always transactional. I constantly struggled with trying to figure out something I would want to do with my life.Back in 2019 a barber that I had been going to for haircuts for a few years said I should go to beauty school. They said they saw something in me and would give me a job after getting my license. I was flattered and believed them. So off I went. Time passes and I finish we had been in regular communication and I even did job shadowing for school with them. As I finished my classes and was registering to take my state board exams they rescinded their offer without reason. That was the summer of 2019.. I took a few months to study and had to retake the exam a few times I get anxious when taking tests. Another barber offered me a job for a trial period. Ultimately he decided I was not a good fit. I was told I was consistent but I was apparently not good enough. I can respect this. Around Thanksgiving we start hearing the word covid in the news and lockdown shortly thereafter. And we all knew what happened.Recently I started working in a chain salon. The manager knew if my circumstances and that I did not have much experience. It has been a struggle people who I work in are turning down coupons for discounts on future cuts with me. Only had a few instances where I needed some assistance. But today I was asked Why are you even cutting hair? After someone was not entirely happy and someone fixed up a mistake I noticed but not before the client.So between my childhood where I was essentially hardwired into being a caretaker and this whole thing with trying to get into haircutting..I am lost.I do see a therapist and it has helped in the past. She knows I have idolized suicide in the past the thoughts were diminishing in frequency but are now returning.I have a partner of 11 years and I could not imagine the pain he would be in if he knew I had taken my own life. he is aware of everything I am sharing with you all now. I have told him I feel like I am not living for myself.I have written two documents one giving him power of attorney in the event of medical emergency and I am incapacitated we are not married and gay so my family would have the final say without this document and I wrote up a will stating what to do with my personal belongings. I also stated how to dispose of my body but not before harvesting any and all intact organs and giving them to people who need them.So yeah.. I do not know how much my life was ever my own. And right now.. I truly wish I could just pass peacefully in my sleep or something. I am not sure what to do,Suicidal

I donate money. I donate so much fucking money. I donated over three minimum wages earlier this year to several different charities. I do my best to help people. I do. I fucking do. I am only 20. I cannot fucking take this anymore. I am too young to feel like this. I am too young for my body to fucking break down like this.I am in constant pain and nausea. Constant. All the time. They alternate sometimes but the breaks I get are brief and they keep getting shorter. Most of the time it is pain and nausea. Constantly.Nothing helps my nausea. Nothing. I was prescribed ondansetron hydrochloride for the nausea the same medication people prescribe to cancer patients going through chemotherapy same dose. It. Did. Not. Fucking. Help. Me. Apparently my body resists the effect for some reason. It only cut my nausea by fucking half on a good day. It did not fucking help. And yet it still did better than any other antiemetic I have tried with one exception the one below.Then I was prescribed domperidone. THAT helped my nausea a lot. It was so nice for a little while. But I had to stop because apparently prolonged use of domperidone is dangerous. I was only supposed to take it for 1 week maximum. I took it for ten days because of just how fucking good it felt to not be nauseous. But it did not last.it is so hard to eat. I no longer take any pleasure in fucking eating. I have been put in a bland diet for IBD despite not having an IBD diagnosis and it HAS BARELY FUCKING HELPED. It has only made me feel more miserable. I cannot eat anything that I like. And even when I try the nausea and the fear of how I am going to feel after eating it make the experience absolutely fucking unpleasant. I cannot fucking enjoy any of it. I am heavily malnourished and NO MATTER WHAT I FUCKING EAT REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH I TRY MY BODY DOES NOT ABSORB ANY OF IT.According to my last blood tests I have vitamin C deficiency scurvy vitamin A deficiency vitamin B12 deficiency and vitamin D deficiency and I take pills for all of those. Most are daily. Doctor told me to take them just for a while. I ended up taking them for 2 months. Did not help.I try my best to fucking eat a healthy fucking diet every single day. It makes no fucking difference. My body simply does not absorb anything. I do not fucking know why.I was at 70kg months ago. I am now at 50.9kg. And I am 1.65m tall. I look like a skeleton. I am so fucking ugly. I am the ugliest fucking woman to ever fucking live. I look terrible. I look disgusting.And those are not my only symptoms. they are only the ones I am not embarrassed to tell other people about. that is not even the beginning of the fucking humiliation. there is so much more.Diarrhea and constipation for me are routine. There are days where I will HAVE to go to the bathroom several times a day with diarrhea until my bowels are fucking bleeding. it is literally impossible to fucking hold. it is like if I ate something bad every single hour of the day except I was not really eating anything it was my body alone. And then there are weeks where I will be unable to go the bathroom at all and the pain is so much worse when that happens. I was given a fuckton of laxatives for those days and yet all they do is trigger the diarrhea instead. I am fucking terrified of taking any of them.And there are almost no good days in between those. You might have thought there are but no when it is not one thing it is another. I cannot I CANNOT fucking enjoy anything anymore. EVERYTHING EVERYTHING I FUCKING DO IN MY LIFE is interrupted by either me throwing up trying not to throw up shitting myself trying not to shit myself or being unable to focus at all due to how much pain I am experiencing.And after several lab tests including blood and stool samples a CT scan and an MRI nothing. All the lab tests showed was that my intestines are absolutely bleeding and are absolutely inflamed as fuck. Imaging exams showed even less. Two hernias and that is it. Literally nothing else.And I had to wait so long for these. I do not want to disclose my location but my country has a public health system and it is literally the only fucking way I was able to afford all of those exams which is AWESOME but because of how underfunded it is the waiting times between the appointments are long the waiting times between expensive exams like a CT scan or MRI are fucking massive. I waited a full six weeks for this MRI. In pain. And it showed fucking nothing.There are so many fucking days where I wish I could just be diagnosed with something like fucking cancer or something just so this would be fucking over. I just want to fucking die. I do not want to go through several examinations and lab tests and imaging and continue to be in fucking pain while I wait. I cannot fucking do this anymore. I cannot. I fucking cannot.There are so many times when I wish I was diagnosed with cancer or something of the sort JUST so people would fucking stop acting as if I was fucking okay. I cannot fucking study like this. I cannot fucking work like this. I am supposed to be getting an internship soon. How THE FUCK am I going to do this? I cannot get out of bed. I am so fucking fatigued. I feel fucking awful. I am a fucking skeleton. I cannot even walk all the way to the university and online classes are going to be over by end of the year. I am going to have to go there again but how the fuck am I supposed to hold myself together there? I am fucking pitiful.And no one is understanding of it. No one gave a fuck until I got the fucking lab tests that showed I am actually fucking bleeding inside and even then no one fucking gives that much of a fuck. I do not get calls. I do not get anything. People look at me like I am blowing it out of proportion. They do not fucking believe me. I cannot fucking take this anymore. I cannot. I cannot. I cannot fucking do it. I cannot fucking take it anymore.No one fucking gets it. I am in constant. Fucking. Pain. I cannot fucking eat. Even if I do it is useless. it is like I put myself through the physical burden of eating while nauseous and digesting food only to shit it all out with blood afterward and feel worse and repeat the fucking cycle. I can feel my body fucking breaking down. I am so fatigued. I am pretty sure I will die soon anyway. I simply want to speed up the process and go on my own terms.I just wanted to write this to say goodbye before I do it. I wanted to at least feel like I left something in my depressing fucking departure. I am not religious I am simply looking forward to the void now because anything is better than this. Anything is better than being in constant fucking pain and nausea every day and still being expected to fucking work and somehow get through university.Goodbye. I am killing myself tonight. I have been in constant pain and nausea for months now. I have lost 20kg in 3 months. I am malnourished. No one knows what I have. I cannot take this anymore.,Suicidal

13318,13338,I am doing this on a throwaway since I am a couple weeks out from everything being in order. i do not want to somehow be traced from any PII i may have let slip on my other accounts and the police be called.i got a pistol last year which in my statealso in the south requires you to apply for a permit and that takes a couple weeks at the time was over a month because covid was driving up sales for some reason i bought it and held onto it for a couple of months. i went to the range and shot 100 rounds. decided i would rather not go out that way that gun had way more of a jolt than i thought it would so I am afraid I would fuck up my aim as i pulled the trigger and did not want to end up in pain embarrassed and retarded. ended up selling it back. i do not think the gun method is for me unless my plan does not work. I will be receiving my next permit in a week or so and buying another handgun. do not plan to use it. if i fail to od successfully and everyone knows I am on watch i will not be able to get one anymore. going to stash it as an in case of emergencylooking into buying a shitload of opiates on the dark web taking a few ambien and then taking enough opiates to kill a horse right when the ambien is about to knock me out. i was hoping to buy fentanyl powder to load into a capsule to take since that can take you out instantly but I am having zero luck finding it so far just some weird shit advertised as like fentanyl but I am looking for a guarantee.i was also at one point thinking i could tie a noose to a bridge around my area swallow a bunch of pills and blow my brains out on the edge that way even if i survived the gunshot the pills and noose would finish the job for me. man my head is a dark place.I have now been thinking about suicide for 15 years and have been medicated and in therapy for a couple years. they helped tremendously but even the strongest meds and therapy multiple days a week are not enough to stop it. i have a mental illness that is genetic and lifelong. it is bad enough now and will only get worse with time. much rather just get it over with.was going to check myself into the hospital but i realized over the past couple months that it would only be prolonging the inevitable. it does not stop. strong antipsychotics do not even make it stop. nothing will fix it. I will keep putting myself in more trouble mania issue. damage all of my friendships destroying my relationship pushing everyone away racked up 15k of online gambling debt in the past 2 weeks etc.a few days ago i wrote a suicide note and then an apologygoodbye to the only loved ones i give a tenth of a fuck about 5 peopleat work i wrote up a list of all the shit i do and how to do it since my location is a very very small group of people.anyways I am out my dudes.just wanted to let that out. thanks for reading I am out,Suicidal
13334,13354,I am looking for someone to talk to who can just agree with me and be sadfrustrateddisappointedannoyed with me that when we die we go in the ground forget everything and that is it and it sucks. There is no point to living no point to anything because even if I hurt my loved ones by killing myself they will eventually die too and forget that pain. There is no greater purpose like increasing the good of the world or the universe. So it honestly confuses me why so many people choose to live this utterly meaningless life. I have attempted suicide several times and I am not at risk of suicide right now so please do not reach out or comment with empty life is worth living information. I am actually in therapy actively trying to find a reason or a desire to live but have not been successful. I feel alone in my frustration that I am stuck in this pointless life and I do not see a good reason why I would not just end it. If you also think there is no point to life and everyone dies and it is all worthless please reach out. I would love to just not feel alone in feeling this way. Mourn life's pointlessness with me? Help me feel less alone?,Suicidal

13370,13390,sorry for bad english it the first time i write in english since the high school. . Since the covid I lost my job as a waiter in a small restaurant because of the closure of this restaurant. I tried to find another job in the industry but a lot of restaurants close. So it is harder to find a job . I sent a lot of CV but I could not find a job. I have already been told by a boss that he just hires women for a family breakfast restaurant . With all the failures I decided to go back to school. School was difficult for me when I was younger I had a diagnosis of autism. They put me in an autism class where I learned nothing. Even I was of the same level as normal people .So i just go away from the school system. Now i want to go back in school because I want to work in the IT field. So I started to take steps for my return to study. I was interested in a program that a friend of mine told me about that gave money to go back to school. I was very excited I said to myself Wow he will give me money to go back to study. So I have to apply but the problem is that the program was no longer available. I was sad but later he had another program like that that trained people for computers. So I applied I made every meeting everything was fine. But finally the person in charge of the program explained to me that I was not aiming for the program because I was a white man.The program was just for women and minorities. So I did not let go and I tried to look for something else but I could not find anything. I feel like I am worth nothing in the society. So now i do not know what to do anymore. I just want to kill myself but I am scared of painful death. Anyway i got nothing. I am sure if i kill myself nobody will care. I want to disappears maybe just going in the wood and just walk until i die to starve where nobody will find me. sorry for bad english it the first time i write in english since the high shcool. I no longer see the light and I am tired,Suicidal
13396,13416,You have no idea how badly I would want to see this.

13643,13663,ampx200BI had planned to kill myself last week but ended up not going through with it. This week I had to face the consequences i.e boss being mad and almost getting fired due to not showing up to work that week. One of the hardest things that I have to deal with while suffering from suicidal thoughts is that despite how at the edge I am the world does not stop moving Like I could be seconds away from ending it and then a few hours later slaving away at my laptop because as much as people like to say they understand your boss does not actually give a shit that you want to blow your brains out. And so to deal with it I frequently try to pretend that everything around me is not happening to ME but to someone else. Sometimes removing myself from situations makes it more bearable. Does anyone else do this Pretending you are in a dreammovie,Suicidal
13647,13667,I hate my family i hate my sisters My father and father argues and fights everytime They tell me to be normal but they are not even normal They fight everytime we are traveling to somewhere Everytime we go to countryside. They are even fighting while I am writing this. I have never been in the beach or hotel. Because every holiday even it is holiday we go to the Village I am not from here i born in city i do not want to g there but every fucking holiday we go to Village and they fight during the traveling. My Mother she broke my pc. My father and mother do not let me do something fun. One day my father came to the park when i was with my friends He slapped me in front of my friends When we were home he said do not talk with those girls WTF? why i cannot talk with girls? i do not get it. I want to have new friends but they do not let me. Whatever i do they find something to be angry with me When I am home they tell me to go out when I am outside they tell me to go home I cannot close my door i cannot use my headset cuz they say you do not hear us when we call you IF I WANTED TO HEAR YOUR DAMNED VOICE I WOULD TAKE OFF THAT HEADSET. I just want to have a nornal family. I want to Go to holiday i want to have friends. They do not let me have a girlfriend i do not fucking care. It is enough WHY me?,Suicidal
13651,13671,I have been having suicidal thoughts ever since i was like in 5th grade or so because i felt like a burden on my family friends and just generally anyone I have interacted with. I have had a really hard time with talking to people too and everyone in my family judges me for it. They are not wrong in doing so but a lot of the times i physically cannot open my mouth and speak. I got a girlfriend around my freshman year in highschool and despite that the thoughts did not go away. I really was happy at times and imagined us living together after getting married and that but a few years later we broke up. Even though she said she did not want to get married I think she is lying to me. She told me that she did not want to get into any relationships until a few years later only to get into one about a week later. This and other incidents of her lying to me made me more sad than i ever had been. Compounding all those other reasons i felt that those years we were together were all a lie which sucks when she could have been the person to pull me out of wanting to kill myself. The suicidal thoughts have gotten to the point to where I am almost always thinking about gruesome ways in which i can kill myself or be killed by others. I have even slipped up and asked my ex to kill me in a begging kind of way. I told her Kill me over and over to her face and I am ashamed of having done that. The thing is despite all of this I have only cried once in about 3 years and I am certain of that. It was when my ex and I broke up. I do not know why or how this happened but i cannot cry anymore no matter how hard i try. I hurt myself physically and mentally and nothing seems to do it. Every thought becomes more and more bloody and that and i even picture my familys reaction to it nothing. I have become obsessed with trying to make myself cry and i even draw a hypothetical of what my suicide might look like. I will not be killing myself anytime soon because I am Catholic and do not want my family to feel bad the whole shtick. But has anyone else not been able to cry or can you relate to any of this? I cannot talk about this to anyone else but i have some anonymity on here so i felt safe in posting this. Thank you. I cannot cry anymore.,Suicidal
13677,13697,I am tired of people telling me I am attractive but nobody actually wants to date me. No matches anywhere online nothing. i know I am going to be alone forever and id rather get it done early and save myself the pain and waste of time i keep visualizing myself doing it,Suicidal
13689,13709,It sounds sadistic I know but I cannot think of any other way. it is hard to hurt someone like that when you are alive. Wish I could kill myself so I can hurt those who have hurt me,Suicidal
13692,13712,Its been a long time since I have cried. Its been even longer since I have truly had the urge to care about something. When I was in the 10th grade I tried a percocet for the first time with a group of my friends. It was that moment that haunts my life to this day. I upgraded to straight fentanyl after a while and it became apparent that I did not make enough to afford my addiction. After ruining about all of my relationships by either stealing or borrowing money from my closest family and friends I went on to ask random strangers Id see at the gas station or distant colleagues. My life was shit before the drug usage. Parents divorced dad a drug addict mom a whore and me a bipolar anxious scared person there was not an absolute reason I should not be using in my mind. After a couple of years of failed attempts of being off and on sober I decided I was going to end it all. However that did not work. My tolerance was to a point that made it very difficult to OD on. On my final attempt however I bought 30 pills. Stimulus check helped me there. I drove to a spot that was public so my body would be found and I snorted 15 of those pills. After woken by police it was obvious that did not work the way I wanted it to. Court ordered to rehab I went through the entire 3 month program flawlessly. Using my previous knowledge of rehabilitations spit outs and a some what will to make myself better I came out feeling sad. I knew Id miss my peers and even some of the counselors. That brings us to a year later. I have stayed clean however I have had constant suicidal thoughts and plans circling my mind for months. I do not know if I should or not but I just want this dark comedy of a life to end. My friends do not talk to me. I miss both my ex girlfriends. I am trying to move on but everything has came with more obstacles than promised. If I do it soon I hope it will all be worth it in the end. My concern is I am wrong about no afterlife. I do not know maybe,Suicidal
13695,13715,I have been trying to but every time I fail I fall into a deeper depression I have been teling myself that everything is going to be better for more than a decade but that is not true everything gets worse and worse every day. Not even succeeding at failing,Suicidal
13697,13717,I do not do anything serious in self harm but i scratch myself pretty badly and it really just does not bother me. I noticed that when i feel pain i have no reaction to it and i stay pretty stoic while its happening. Anyways i thought i stopped caring about my problems. I have not I have just gotten a lot less emotional about it. I used to cry about every night i guess I have just had enough so now i just feel it all on the inside. I started being an asshole to my friends again i do not really care about it though i just thought it was worth mentioning. Thanks for reading this if you did. It means a lot. If you did please comment that you did because more than anything it helps to know that people are listening. Thank you. Pain does not bother me anymore,Suicidal
13734,13754,I do not think I have depression but every time I feel said I have suicidal thoughts. I have ocd and that restricts me to do what normal teenagers my parents have been putting too much pressure on me like they try to force me to do what I am not comfortable doing like for instance going to dinner yes that is a big problem for me because I just cannot fathom the idea of leaving the house during the evening because when I get home Ill take an hour shower and use a whole bar of soap to rinse off all the germs. Yes I have been getting better slowly but progress is progress and that is what my parents do not realize. Just the weight of it all is killing me. Every time I cry I think of overdosing on my prescriptions I almost did it too one time I took out all my prescriptions I counted 64 pills in total and as I was going to take the first half I stopped and realize that I am actually scared and that I do not want to die. I do not know what to do,Suicidal
13752,13772,I have tried for 15 yeats to get psychologicalhelp for my ocd before i switched to medicare an after being in hospital five times I am done...I have been drinking a lite of alchol week for ocd. tried copious amoumt of meds icluding seroque lithium and zyprexa.I am reaching my end and okaywith it I am done..even if i do not want to accept it..,Suicidal
13754,13774,I tried to jump off a building just something happened that brought me to a breaking point. I got restrained and later told I had disrupted some event so I should not have done it. I guess even trying to end it all is something I do wrong. I tried to kill myself today.,Suicidal

13840,13860,I have been a bad place lately and I have no one to talk to about how I am feeling who will actually listen. I have gotten a job recently in construction I was tired of feeling miserable every day at work in retail. My wife encouraged me to take the job though I had a feeling it would not be a good fit for me. But I took the job so I would stop being pestered about finding a new job. My wife tells me to talk to her but whenever I do she is not involved in listening. and when I do have an ok day she is expecting me to be unresponsive emotionally gets angry at me over something stupid and sends me down a depressive spiral all over again. I understand it is hard on her she been through a lot of shit the past few years but I do not need that kind of stress piled on top of what I am feeling. Works beating me down but I lack the self esteem to follow up on interviews for jobs I might enjoy. I just feel like I am living the same lousy day over and over again. I wake up have coffee drive to wherever my job is that day attempt to perform well at my job and end up disappointing myself. I am just not happy and do not know what to do Life's been really crap lately idk what to do,Suicidal
13855,13875,I just want someone to speak to freely who I can hug I do not want to always be scared of what they might say I want to talk about my suicide thoughts and depression but my friends are not like that all and that is why I think I am going to hang myself I know its selfish since I recently bought a dog and that life depends on me but I cannot do it anymore I just want to hang myself and people can talk to me one here and help me as much as they want but they are not IRL I cannot see you I cannot fucking do anything so this is one of my final posts and the fact that I have posted on here alot and all the time I have tried I might succeed thus time hopefully I just want someone to hug,Suicidal
13867,13887,Its been a year since my last attempt and I think I am ready to leave my life behind for good. My mind puts me through so much torment every day it immobilizes me. I cry myself to sleep. I have been through five therapists and none of them could help me. I have been in groups and intensive outpatient. Nothing helps. And I have nobody in my life who I can talk to. Everyone is so far up their own butts they cannot be there for me. It hurts that no one ever asks me how I am doing. When I have tried being open with them they judge me take away my rights or ignore me. I just do not know what to do anymore. I enjoy things for a moment and then it sinks in how terrible everything really is. I want to be dead. And this is kind of my last attempt at stopping myself. Sick of life. No one there for me.,Suicidal
13887,13907,I just told my mom that I want to die and she said get over it ,Suicidal
13899,13919,I really think there is no risk for those who have already decided to kill themselves. nothing scares you nothing frustrates them nothing they say will change anything. In a way I feel free but I think it is better I do not do anything stupid before killing myself. Suicide freedom,Suicidal
13900,13920,I never looked for help I never told anyone not even astrange. I do not know if this is my paranoia or if it actually happensbut I think everyone hates me and does not pay attention to me. I participatedfrom another depressionsuicide reddit but no one answered me.Maybe the same thing happens in this one but the simple act of writing alleviatesvery D Hey everyone. ,Suicidal
13935,13955,And fuc you benjichip41. You must feel happy getting a sick kick out of reading people posts about suicide. Or you just want to be the only one that can feel that way and no one else. Foh This is my last post here as I see people get a kick out of reading commenting negatively on suicidal posts.,Suicidal
13971,13991,I have reached the burned out stage. I am in a never ending hole of misery and mentally I just cannot take it anymore.I have spent the day trying to decide what to do regarding the care of my children after I am gone and I cannot decide what to do because after I am gone they really will not have anyone.I have spent the last 2 months trying as hard as I can to rebuild our lives and things have only gotten worse. I have never been the person to quit or give up and yet here I am completely broken and past my breaking point.Let this be my last words here as I have shared in a few more places. I tried. No support,Suicidal
14001,14021,I am posting this message as soon as i hang myself. call the police so they can get my body. My address is 742 Roger Ave Allen Park Mi 48101 I will be dead by the time they get there I am killing myself,Suicidal
14003,14023,I cannot get a grip I have wasted everyone is time and fucked everything up. No more thanks. The Big Sleep. Soon.,Suicidal
14019,14039,I cut myself for the first time last night and have been continuously hiring myself various ways. I am just hoping one works eventually to end it all Hurt myself,Suicidal
14030,14050,Even with a bmw old model and some bills i cannot get a girlfriend Crying like a slut,Suicidal
14043,14063,If i have luck like last time i will be fine the next day. But i would be fine with dying at this point my body survived to much shit already. If my life ends it ends. So i took a bunch of pills,Suicidal
14057,14077,I feel like I am here for selfish reasons so people that do not really care about me rather see me alive and suffering than to be gone and they feel badguilty. I do not want to conform to this world anymore. I do not want to care what material things you all have. I do not even want it if it means leaving this body. You all can have it. Whether i had it or not i still feel empty and lonely. I ll let the universe know this week I do not want to be here. Idc what suffering n torture i ll endure after this. Idc about my own fear. I am going to leave whether people like it or not. I literally have nothing to lose or live for. I sleep outside yet I am still alive. I tried taking alot of pills and even attempted to hang myself. Either it do not work or i chicken out at the last moment. I do feel that I am getting closer to ending it all,Suicidal
14061,14081,Like most adults I think occasionally I get random thoughts of suicide...driving my car into the barrier taking that step over the balcony etc. I would never actually do it but it is just ideation that I have heard is relatively common. Lots of shit hit the fan today though. And from just about the time that I woke up I have wanted to string myself up from the ceiling. Someone tell me not to. Someone tell me not to kill myself,Suicidal
14083,14103,I am ending my life on Sunday. This date will not be adjusted. I am going to post again before then but I wanted to share this with people that understand. Actually following through this time,Suicidal
14109,14129,I may be suicidal but only because I try so hard to solve a problem yet fucking life throws another one at me. No one asks me are you ok? For fuck sake I do not even have real friends. I am a self diagnosed high functioning bipolar person and when everyone says stay strong or it is ok they have a fucking easy life. I may not kill myself but is it hard to ask for less problems. After a CPS case my dad did not change one bit even with all the effort tears and emotion. I give up he said to me the other day do not question me this is my house blah blah blah. Then I lost my fucking dorm contract because I was homeless when they sent it to me. Been calling for days leaving dozens of voicemails and a couple of emails. The one thing I was looking forward to in life is taken away from me by sheer unluckiness. My parents just forget about the CPS incident and just pretend everything is ok when its clearly not. A fucking plastic life in which I have to live in everyday and when I fall asleep I am reminded I am part of that plastic too. My mood swings have been unbearable and I just sit read and journal but the thoughts still creep in. To the suicide hotline which I did the text through but the guy seemed disinterested. I cannot even trust my own sister because I feel like I will get betrayed I cannot even trust my friends because they themselves cannot relate. I do not even have my high school counselors because I graduated high school. My own thoughts always think if I talk to someone I need to pay them back in some way. Coming from trauma I trick myself that no one really cares and nothing is free and people are nice they just want something. Just crying myself to sleep and accepting my parents will never change and the fucking university housing will never reply back. I will always fucking remember when my parents called me a retard and trapped me in a room for a whole afternoon thinking I will remember the alphabet. I have no one to trust. I cannot even trust my own thoughts. I cannot even hope for a better future if fate is just shoving me down to hell. I do not want to die. I just do not want to worry about my problems. I just want a normal life. Is that too much to ask for? All that is left is a bunch of cortisol and hopelessness. what is left is the thought of suicide not code red but just a thought. A reoccurring thought that always comes back. I do not want to die. I just want my problems to end.,Suicidal
14112,14132,sometimes I just have to wonder why we live. If we all die in the end and do not remember anything why live? Nobody is going to remember you because were all going to die so why does it matter so much that we have to live and keep going. Were tiny organisms in this big universe so why? People always say hey do not do it! its not worth it! Then what is worth it? does our existence really matter? Is anyone really going to care if you die? are strangers or people on the internet really going to go out of their way to cry for you? what is the point in our society? Spending over a decade in the education system only to go out and live a mundane life everyday and then die. Is living even worth it? Why do we live,Suicidal
14119,14139,I was doing better what happened ? ! its like i finally found some type of footing and my own brain turns against me making me feel insecures and that i would be better off dead. some times i wish i gave in a while ago. i just have to either live with this for the rest of my life or kill my self. i am tired of feeling like no one truly understands. what happened ? ! ? !,Suicidal
14147,14167,I am not afraid of dying but I am afraid of waking back up if I am not successful. My brother committed suicide a month ago and I have never thought he would do such a thing. He would always seem like he was angry or always slept in late but I never perceived it as sad or suicidal. He was only 17. He was my only brother. My little brother. I have never thought I would ever see my brother in a hospital bed. I always thought it would be the other way around. I have dealt with major depression and ptsd for a long time and I had always thought of killing myself. I was not sure how I would do it. If I were to I want to make sure I never come back. I have decided in November I am going kill myself. Just not a specific day or time. Not really sure yet on how kind of have an idea but might look more into it. So far as of now Ill try to better myself. Look for a new therapist take care of myself be a better daughter be a better girlfriend be a better friend. Maybe Ill change my mind later but I do not feel like things will get better. Holding on for a little longer.,Suicidal
14150,14170,People are so selfish and do not care. Even my own family told me to go ahead and kill myself when I said I am depresdsed I want to die because no one gives a shit about anybody today,Suicidal
14179,14199,I live my life everyday in fear and misery and i just want it all to go away. Doc prescribed me kpins to help but they do not so i just want to take enough to go to sleep and never wake up. how much klonopin is considered an overdose?,Suicidal
14271,14291,Living life on this Earth is a curse.I am so tired of reaching out to get help. Why are people telling me to get help? I do not think I want to anymore. I do not see the point in forcing myself to want to live. I am just so tired. I just want to cease existing. I wish I just never existed.,Suicidal
14272,14292,Everything is better when I am asleep. I honestly wish I just do not wake up later. I slept all day and it felt amazing. I wish I just did not wake up tho.,Suicidal
14294,14314,People talk about the morality of killing yourself of the pain you leave behind for those that love you. They talk about religious implications and of the pain of different methods of suicide. They talk about the regret of not being able to achieve your goals in life if you are dead as if my ten year plan would matter at all to my corpse. But none of that is why I am still here positive or negative it does not inform my decision. I am here because of the terror of waking up in the hospital the morning after my attempt at self harm. The fear that in by trying to end the pain of life I will make my situation that much worse. Unable to use my hands because I slashed through my tendons? Unable to speak or control simple motor functions because of the brain damage from lack of oxygen? Paralyzed or comatose or with a giant crater in my head from a bullet that just could not quite get the job done? Did you know that suicide by shooting yourself in the head only has an 82 chance of succeeding? Scariest fact I have learned in a while. Fear of Failure that is what is keeping me on my feet today. But there is always tomorrow. Fear of failure,Suicidal
14297,14317,Everyone has a policy and now I have mine. But the one weird thing holding me back was guilt when I know they do not really care about me or my emotions. they will turn their back on me when I need them or laugh at me or throw my struggles in my face but when I manage to pull myself out of a dark place they enjoy being there like they did something. I do not even know why I was worried. I guess because I feel empathy for them because I know what it feels like to not have anyone care but whatever. I do not really have anything left. I tried hobbies and making friends but I do not have the patience or energy to maintain them. I do not like or feel connected with people and whatever people I have in my life I am definitely the least favorite and least liked. I hate school I hate my program. I can no longer find joy in the little things like music or food. I have tried therapy multiple therapists and either they are too expensive or they are not good. I tried to joint a program where I feel like Id be around more caring people just to feel a community and have someone who sees the world similarly to me but that also backfired. there is just nothing keeping me here anymore. I am going to go read and finish the policy and start planning. My family is taking a life insurance policy out on me so at least I can leave them with something,Suicidal
14298,14318,I want to die. I have no future. Its too difficult to eat because I cannot stand weight gain nor my own company its too unbearably painful not eating. My only motivation to get healthy and stay alive was my so but they have broken up with me. Told me they are no longer in love with me after 8 years together. I want them back so badly I sometimes consider murder suicide. But they do not want me anymore and I see no reason to live. Because I cannot get out of this eating disorder and I cannot get them back either. Fuck it all. I just want it over now I just want relief. I want final relief,Suicidal
14310,14330,Hey guys I live in UK. I have harm OCD which basically means I have had intrusive thoughts to harmkill myself and others my whole life. I have always struggled trying to get help because OCD is so misunderstood. Like when you go to the Dr and say you need mental health help. They ask you are you a risk of harm to yourself or others? Or something along those lines. And before you even answer they say because if you are I will have to report it. I find these questions really difficult because A. I have been suicidal my whole life I have self harmed my whole life and I have had intrusive thought to hurt others my whole life. At certain points I have very bad breakdowns where I feel like I might actually act on these intrusive thoughts. But if I told a Dr how I really felt I would be sectioned which I know would make everything a lot worse for me. So I say no I am not at risk I am not suicidal. And then you get no help at all and they do not help you as urgently as you need it. So I was just wondering how many people have been really suicidal but lied to Doctor's out of fear of being held against their will sectioned? Sectioning,Suicidal
14334,14354,I am not trying to be dramatic or anything but I honestly just hate life and want to die very badly. Living is constant mental pain and i hate it. I have also come to realization that life is pointless and it has no meaning even if life did have meaning I still would not enjoy it. In my case suicide is not a permanent solution to a temporary problem because my problem is that I hate life and that is never going to change so suicide is a permanent solution to a permanent problem for me. Suicide is the only thing that will fix my problem and give me peace. I seriously do not want live anymore. 16M,Suicidal
14339,14359,i have not had a good day in a while and today is particularly bad which is how i got here i just wanted to let everyone here know that i am proud of them the people who post about their issues and the ones that do not the people who try to help and the people who would like to help but do not have the strength no matter who you areI am Proud of YOU you struggle like we all do with thoughts of suicide and or dying or harming ourselfs to get through the day you are not weak for thinking about it you are not weak for considering it you are STRONG for still being here you are STRONG for still hanging on and though i do not know you or what you are dealing with i do not know if there is a chance for it to get better one day or not but i hope it does i hope you all find that happiness that makes you hang on for just a day longer and then again tomorrow and the day after. many people would have probably broken if they went through what you are going through right now so be proud that you have made it so far and even if you are not i am proud of you regardless I am proud of every single one of you,Suicidal
14351,14371,that is all it really feels like at this point but I do not want to wait anymore. it is going to happen eventually but I wish it would happen now. I am sorry to my parents. I am just waiting to die,Suicidal
14357,14377,ppl always said that they are giving you virtual hugs when you got sad and while i appreciate that all i need is just hug right here right now bone crushing hug that will heal all of my wound .. is that really too much to ask ?just please hug me i just need a hug,Suicidal
14376,14396,News flash it does not. I tried attempting suicide in September 2020 and I remember waking up in the AampE crying my eyes out telling the doctors why did I have to wake up when I was finally at peace. The doctors hardly cared they just told me to 'move on' and said things like 'so that is why you are killing yourself?' and invalidated my emotions and struggles since I was a child. it is July 2021 and I still wish I never woke up. All my friends ended up cutting ties with me my own family keeps hitting me and telling me they give up on taking care of me because I am a lost because. My mother has still refused to talk to me and plans to send me to an asylum because she does not want any responsibility of me anymore. And that is when I calmed down. I calmed down because I have nothing else to lose and I truly do not have to worry about anymore what ifs. This is it. I finally stopped crying because I finally made up my mind and I feel so at peace with it. The biggest lie anyone told me is that things will get better,Suicidal
14389,14409,I have had suicidal thoughts for most of my life and I assume like many other people I never really talked to anybody about it. I gave some hints here and there over the years but most of it was brushed off so for a long time I just thought it was normal. I never actually attempted anything but I planned a lot of it and started making a draft for my suicide letters. I promised myself that I would not actually do anything until I finished them but always broke down as I wrote those so they never got finished. Most of this happened in middle school and high school. I am now in my last term of college about to get my bachelors. I have gotten a lot better over the years but I can feel myself slipping more and more over this last year or so. I have just spent the last couple days disassociating in bed and I am sure everyone just thinks I am being a flake and I guess I am but I am just trying to make sure I do not slip back to where I use to be. Like I do not have time to deal with this I am in my last freaking term but I feel like I am getting closer and closer to the edge of a meltdown. I do not know. I do not want to die. I just feel so lost right now and death just sounds so heartbreakingly sweet. Relapsing,Suicidal
14400,14420,I am a monster I need to say it somewhere and online where no one knows me seems like the best way I heard voices for 7 years of my life I fear every day they will come back I cannot preform basic things others find easy and all I want is to hurt others and to feel pain myself. I want to die to never have to worry about hurting anyone ever again but it dosent feel right I am trying to be good I may be bad deep down but if I never act on it maybe I can help others. But it hurts i cannot keep a job because I will pass out or feel nothing but pain till I am away from everything I just feel like a useless piece of shit maybe I am autistic would that just make me more faulty I have started having cuts pop up on my body I do not even remember doing it I have never been a cutter. Maybe I wou I do not know. My parents hate me. Why am I like this why am I not normal. I do not want to take pills that is not really me it is a fake. I need to say something somewhere,Suicidal
14419,14439,I am just waiting for my mom to pass away so I can eventually do it. Probably not immediately after her death more sporadic like most suicides. It would be easier. Dad would not give a shit because he got my sister who he is proud of. I am the bastard of the family to him. Anyone like this in that you will not do it because of a love one still here and do not want to upset them? Fuck it,Suicidal
14422,14442,Welp I am home alone blasting music from the TV laying on the floor thinking of dying. Should i kms tho? I probably should. But what about my friends? Eh they will probably be fine etc that is what I have been thinking for half an hour now. everything sucks so much ass rn i hate it i should most likely just kms already but it will hurt like shit Damn.,Suicidal
14441,14461,I am going to kill myself. I am not saying that for attention. I want to kill myself but I am too scared to do it because I feel like I will regret it but I am failing school and I have so much exams and I need to do a presentation in front of my class and I am so fucking nervous I cannot deal will life anymore I am not a hard worker and I hope the other side is better where I do not have to do anything School is too stressful for me,Suicidal
14449,14469,I was just getting to a point where I did not want to drive my car off the nearest bridge and then boom serious medical issues. I am losing my vision. I am in pain. I have visual disturbances. Thanks to the new meds and some freaking issue in my brain I also have auditory disturbances. So essentially I feel like I am going ducking crazy. I am only writing this rn because I am stuck with insomnia. I am pretty sure I had a seizure earlier and my husband just rolled over and was like hmm? Like thanks idk what is happening but glad ur on it bruh. My pituitary gland is flattened out? Idk if that can because all of these intense mood changes or if its the Nortriptyline I was started on. Anyways really fighting the urge todo it. The hard part is that I know how easy it would be to do it and make it look like a total accident but I have a 2 yr old who is autistic and it feels like I am the only one in our family that does what is best for him. So I have to stay. But I STG if I do lose my vision and am actually blind I will just do it. I am an artist by trade. How tf just yeah. I am thankfully about to pass out and go to sleep thanks to some anti nausea meds. Thanks for reading my rant Pseudotumor side effects,Suicidal
14456,14476,I have been getting about 10 hours of sleep a week for the past 4 months due to horrible coughing fits. I finally got a second doctor's appointment tomorrow after the medicine from the first did absolutely nothing to help at all. My life has become a living hell and if they are unable to help me tomorrow morning I am going to end my life. I cannot take the sleep deprivation and constantly coughing until I gag or vomit. I will still kill myself eventually even if they are able to help me but if they are not I am just calling it in now. It may be coming up soon,Suicidal
14463,14483,It becomes more and more apparent that this ship is sinking every day. When life is just about working making money bouncing from one hedonistic pleasure to another you are going to end up with what we have which is a bunch of people with no real meaning and ironically no pleasure. So obviously we need a change. But where the fuck would this start? How can we reform society when it is so dug in to our lives. Even when you get past that who has the recoursesmoney to get something like this started who will actually use it to benefit others rather than themselves? I wish I could just find a large piece of land and try to start building a new society but of course someone would say I own this land you cannot be here. Even if you could somehow get around that problem would people give up the things they are used to like computers and cell phones and junk to participate in this new society? I have pretty much got nothing to lose at this point. What do you guys think? Want to start a new society? I think it is obvious that society is all fucked up and needs a change but how do we get started?,Suicidal
14468,14488,My thoughts amount to nothing ore than an attempt to intellectualize my own depression and suicidal tendencies and if I had anything of real value to say it would be in a university and note a suicide note on Reddit.com so you should not take anything said here seriously. Id like to return to a time before I could process stimuli a time long before I could recognize that I could process stimuli. Suffering is a quintessential characteristic of life. Endless strains of boredom are riddled with doubt insecurity and disappointment and this is tolerated all in the pursuit of rare instances of euphoria. Id rather cease to react to anything at all to forfeit my awareness of my thoughts feelings ambitions physical pain. Id rather not have been born at all. Id like lose consciousness,Suicidal
14473,14493,I am a 15 year old boy and a couple years ago I started to like a girl. She was the most beautiful girl I had ever met but I was so afraid to tell her how I felt. Up until last august. She said she did not know me well enough but she respected my honesty. She unfortunately passed away in April. One of her friends said she thought I was sweet and genuine and now I can never prove it to her. I sometimes think about this and feel like there is no point now for me to be here to stay strongIm not very good looking at least it definitely appears that way I have only ever been rejected or let down nicely and on top of that I get shy around girls I like and I am awkward.I have only ever been average or below at everything I am not popular or anything so I do not rlly get invited to like parties or anything which especially sucks bc its summer and I usually have to be the one to set up hang outs with my 23 friends The only thing really keeping me going is that my 16th birthday is in November and I do not want to miss thatGiven all this I feel like sometimes I do not want to be here anymore and that things could never get better and all I really ask for is for someone to tell me its going to be ok or tell me I am wrong in my thinking with reasoning please? Hurting,Suicidal
14484,14504,Everybody needs somebody so let us be there for eachother... I never had the privilege to make real life friends so social media was the only place i could be social and rn I am at this stage of my life where i do not have any friends left... so anybody wants to be my friend? Hey,Suicidal
14500,14520,I have struggled with suicidal thoughts in the past and honestly it is been so long that I thought all of it was behind me. But lately I have been having some dark thoughts. And even though I like to believe I would never act on them I am scared I will not be able to work through this on my own. I have tried therapy in the past with no success. Mostly because I clam up and struggle to communicate when it comes to talking about anything that feels too real. I hate myself for feeling this way because I have so much to live for and I know but it is getting so hard to pretend I am ok. I think I need help,Suicidal
14522,14542,he is not going to come back and I am losing hope rapidly. i think it is time then. i did not plan this but i guess that is that realization,Suicidal
14544,14564,I live with my parents 16 and I need to find a way to make it so they will not know for a few days. Thinking of saying I am staying at a friends house and going off into the woods give them a fake address for my friend because they do not have any connection to them. Also do not want my friends to know but the only ones my parents are able to contact also does not have this friends address. I want to kill myself tonight problem is I have work in the morning and it would be so fucking selfish to leave them short handed. Maybe tomorrow night then. Any other ideas to make sure nobody knows where I am for a few days? Hoping to OD on caffeine pills how to make sure parents do not know for a few days.,Suicidal
14546,14566,I really need to talk to someone. I am still struggling through my first heartbreak and I do not see I will survive it if I do not have anyone to talk to and no I am not being dramatic and tell me to call a hotline you might as well finish me yourself. Heartbroken,Suicidal
14548,14568,Many have said this Death is not scary it is the uncertainty of what comes after it. I have tons of things I want to accomplish yet they feel so far away. I have friends but they do not feel genuine. Even if I try to find a home in this world I feel like I do not belong anywhere. it is so hard to trust anyone humans can easily fake emotions. I am so afraid and tired of everything. If I was not afraid of pain I might have killed myself a long time ago.,Suicidal
14551,14571,Recently lost someone as in they did not want to be in my life anymore. I am now feeling like self harming and drinking is the solution to the pain. Really do not want to wake up anymore at this point. Feeling it,Suicidal
14553,14573,I have been sitting with a gun for hours and i just cannot do it. why why cannot i die,Suicidal
14568,14588,I thought a vaccine would make me feel safe but I am not. I am certain I will get a breakthrough case which will leave me on a ventilator unless I kill myself. And then everyone in the hospital will be yelling at me. I cannot do that. I need to find a way to kill myself before this virus does This pandemic has got me,Suicidal
14570,14590,I do not really know what to do right now because I feel awful and I feel sad and I feel so out of it but also so stuck in my head. I do not even know how I feel and I hate how my brain always goes back to suicide no matter how much I try to kick the habit.I will tell my brain to stop that I cannot rely on suicide that it is getting old but nothing I can do will make it stop. I am tired and I am tired of never seeing my therapist and honestly I do not really even believe in therapy anymore. And I am tired of taking medicine because I do not really think it is doing much to me except making me bored and uncreative. And I know that is not the case. I know that I crave off of feeling in extremes and that not feeling in extremes does not mean that I am not feeling at all and it is okay to be baseline sometimes and that does not mean that I am not capable of feeling ever.I just feel that at this point I have exhausted all options. Any time I actually felt better was just me being distracted. I feel like I am never going to get better. I can grow up and graduate college and become a CEO or get everything I could ever want or change the world in any way I want and I would still think about suicide.I feel like I should just give in and accept its control over me. I am so tired of it at this point. it is not even manic depression anymore. it is burnout it is frustration it is desperation. giving in.,Suicidal
14619,14639,I have been depressedsuicidal for the past year or so but it got much worse this year. I have not been attending my online classes and lying to my mum about how university is going. The thing is that no one contacted me from the university to check up on me. The only time I received contact was for a missing assignment. I am scared because I know my mum will find out soon and get mad at me. All of my older siblings have been successful but I have just been lying in bed on most days this year just wanting to end it. I have been trying to distract myself with video games and other stuff. Also since my mum thinks everything is fine with me she has been pressuring me to get a job. I am filled with anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I just want to run far far away. I am scared. I just wanted to get this off my chest. I have been reading all of the posts on the reddit since I discovered it and it helps to know that I am not alone in this world. And for that I am thankful. Guess who has not been attending University for the past six months,Suicidal
14699,14719,I have tried telling friends and family about my feelings but it feels like I have just been the boy who cried wolf or just saturated the whole thing to where they are just tired of hearing it. I cannot bring myself to talk to them so I am trying here before I end up making a forever decision. At this point just saying it to someone makes it feel better I hope it stays this way I am afraid of what will happen when telling someone does not help. How can you deal with something like this alone?,Suicidal
14811,14831,there is no point anymore sorry guys Goodbye,Suicidal
14852,14872,I have not killed myself because I am a huge pussy. So I am just in a position of not knowing because I do not want to live but because I am so useless at dying I am forced to live I do not know what I am doing with my life right now,Suicidal
14854,14874,I recently found out that people with adhd have a dopamine deficiency and it causes them to chase things that give them dopamine I thought I was just severely depressed with nothing helping but I am pretty sure I just have a dopamine deficiency because when I do get dopamine thru dangerous behaviors its the best thing but its always somthing super dangerous that is gives me dopamine I do not get it from things most people do anymore idk but I feel a little better knowing that but I am still stuck feeling like shit with nothing to do about it my insurance is going to expire and I cannot afford therapy or pills or any of that stuff I can barley afford to pay rent idk I also have bpd so my life expectancy is 27 most of us off our selfs and I am starting to see why its becoming more and more difficult to find reasons to keep trying. Its just the same shit everyday and why? Why is it so hard for me to do anything but other people have no cares and just do whatever I want to be like that I want to not care I want to feel alive but I do not! I feel hollowempty and I have tried everything to help but my mind just does not want to be here anymore sometimes I think about running into the woods and just succumbing to nature. I know it sounds stupid but some people just are not made to be here long and I feel as though I am one of them Adhd,Suicidal
14929,14949,i do not know what is right and what is wrong. I am so mad because I am left behind wondering what should i do. i do not know what to do. everyone just says not to do it but I am struggling and I am weak. i do not know how to think. my mum and friends know of my plans anyway. it makes them sad but I am sadder. life is just so sad and unfair I am so scared,Suicidal
14960,14980,Now I am hiding upstairs. Partner says he does not want me to leave but I know he only said it because of me screaming I want to die before leaving in my pyjamas. I cannot do this shit anymore. One minute I am happy and everything is great and the next I hate him because he did not kiss me when he came home and I loose it. I have ruined every good thing I have ever had and I have spent the last year getting more and more suicidal. I just cannot continue with these constant thoughts of just not being good enough and wanting to die. I cannot. Just walked out down a field in my pyjamas and flip flops,Suicidal
14964,14984,I am at a point in my life where I have sort've just had enough. I do not have many friends and not so long ago someone closest to me ended his own life. He already had his issues worse ones than me and he is tried to do it before.. I do not know why it is surprised me so much but now I feel alone. While I was sitting at home playing games and relaxing my best friend was killing himself and that fact kills me. My girlfriend is not around anymore she was about the only person who truly made me feel happy. Having her around made everything feel better. The entire relationship gave me something I desperately needed hope that I could be better and confidence something I always had very little of. Now that is gone too and I blame myself and my issues for it. I have my own issues as well. I have anxiety which has gotten so bad to the point where I cannot go to uni simply because I am scared. Not to mention depression which just feels like it is getting worse and worse by the week. Suicidal thoughts are constant nowadays. They do not stop. I think about it a lot when I try to sleep and as messed up as it sounds it is the only thought that comforts me and helps me sleep. I just hate myself nowadays and I genuinely cannot imagine myself ever liking myself.Not so long ago I did some research online on what drugs could because an overdose and decided that was the easiest way to go about it along with a decent amount of prescription drugs that I have at home. I am truly at the end of my rope. I dislike living and what scares me is the fact that I truly want to die. I feel I have no future. Not so long ago I decided I would wait till after my birthday to do it. Not because I want to be around for my last birthday but because my grandmother was born on the same day as me and my older brother was born the day prior so I did not want to screw it up for them but that thoughtfulness is gone and I am about ready to throw my trainwreck of a life away tonight. I do not really have anyone to tell these things to so I figured a bunch of online strangers would not be the worst thing in the world. I am sorry for making this thing longer than it should have. I am no longer interested in living.,Suicidal
14978,14998,i feel like no matter what i do everything just fucks up. nothing i do is right. there is no right answer. i do not know what i did wrong. I am just so tired of it all. i want everything to go back to normal. i feel like such a fucking idiot bc its happening again. I am tired. i want it to stop. but i know its worse for the ones around me. i want them to stop too. i want everything to stop. I am so tired,Suicidal
14982,15002,Anyone open to chat? Hey,Suicidal
15012,15032,I have been up all night almost every night last week. I posted before what my plan was.I have been passing the hours smoking drinking doing blow and writing over and over my suicide letter. I backed out of getting the gun after my birthday because my partner found out. Today I am going to put my name back in. All I can think about is getting that gun driving to the coast and pull the trigger. I do not think I can do this anymore. I wish I had not backed out I would have it by now. I will finish this smoke and go. Up all night last week,Suicidal
15040,15060,its just my biggest fantasy on how i want to go out. idk why i do not want to die by all the other methods but yeah. the problem is none of my nearby buildings come close to tall i want to leap off a building,Suicidal

15069,15089,My life always fucking sucked overall. But still people keep adding up and adding up shit.Closest person I am to exaggerated about having a cancer. For god sakes. It pushed me over the edge and now I am being a cunt for wanting to kill myself over the amount of stress that I no longer want to face.After all I have been through in my life I cannot even get some understanding.I am fuckimg fed up. I will end my life soon. So fucking soon. And I am writing this as a fucking testimony of what I am about to do. People cannot tell I have not fucking warned them. The last fucking straw,Suicidal

15092,15112,The hole inside me started to get bigger. I am suffering from loneliness and no love. I tried to find someone in different dating apps it helps for 23 weeks but they always losing interest in communication. I do not want to do this anymore. I have time to get too attached to people but when they are leaving me I feel that they are tearing my soul apart. I do not know what to do. Suicidal thoughts are not accustomed for me but it unfortunately started and getting worse every day. I tired,Suicidal
15177,15197,my parents said that and i want to actually do it now just to spite them ig My parents said they would kill me if it was not a big hassle,Suicidal
15205,15225,I have a college student and have been struggling with depression since highschool. I have tried calling helplines and talking to friends and family but it does not seem to work. What should I include in my suicide note if I go through with it? Hope to give some closure to those close to me. Thank you. What should I include in my suicide note?,Suicidal

15295,15315,I really fucked up. Bad. I might have derailed my entire future. I was really lucky to get the job I had. It was a miracle really. But I fucked up and lost my job within the first week. It was a great paying job with benefits and everything. But I guess I am just a fuck up? I have someone who depends on my income and now we might be living on the streets. I think I basically ruined not only my life but theirs too. TLDR My situation is hopeless...convince me otherwise? I selfsabotaged myself to the point where my life might actually be ruined,Suicidal
15306,15326,people's words are not getting through to me. I am so sick of being alive but i cannot do anything about it because of my parents. what a pain. i just do not know what to do anymore. it is so enfuriating i wish i were dead,Suicidal
15369,15389,Everytime I type in I want to die or something of the suicidal sort while feeling this fucking low I get so blindingly pissed off when I see the damn suicide help line number pop up with the obligated abs ever so typical Help is available.The help line has never helped me none of them. Neither has anyone else I have opened up to. Fuck. Off. Every time I type in I want to die...,Suicidal
15381,15401,for a little while i did everything right. i was finally on a schedule. i was more social. i had more hobbies. and then one inconvenience today reminded me why i wanted to die in the first place. i hope tomorrow never comes.I am fucking trapped here i need to leave right now please let me go this is fucking torture i cannot do it anymore nothing hurts more than going back to breaking down when you thought you were improving,Suicidal
15382,15402,I probably going to ramble a bit so sorry about that.also sorry for bad english I have not found motivation to fix anything in my life for a long time now. it is not that I want to die luckily I did not really had those thoughts for a while now altho the ocasionall thought does appear but as fast as it apeared it dissapears too. I would like to fix my life but putting effort into something worthless does not seem ok for me. Sounds like a waste of time because I cannot change. At least it feels like it. I cannot exactly describe how do I feel. Everything feels... Grey. Even the thoughts in my head weather it be good or bad it just has this emptiness feel to it but not in a bad way. I would like to change but I do not want to change either. I do not even feel motivation to kill myself. I mean why bother? It only going to because pain to others. Some might even blame themselves and this feeling of emptiness would just go to the other person. I hate to talk about these things because there are people who has a harder life than I do. I mean I am posting on a site where are peoples who went trough the worst shit has a traumatic sad life yet here I am complaining and whine like a little kid. kind of feels like my feelings are not valid in any way or form. Maybe I am just selfish. I do not know anymore... Heck I never knew anything. Honestly I do not know what I want or need anymore.,Suicidal
15387,15407,Do any of you just that this feeling that if someone held you for a bit maybe everything will be okay?I mean like holding you as you cry and mumble about your troubles. Maybe rubbing your back or patting your head reassuringly. Never discouraging you from your emotions only letting you and your saddness exist with them. Maybe whispering let it out or its okay or even it is all going to be okay without ever shushing you. Maybe I am just that bad though I would be lying if I said I did not find comfort in this pathetic fantasy.God this just makes me feel more ashamed of my feelings. I have never attempted to yet but I cannot help feeling like I do not want to exist anymore. Surely I do not really have a right to complain when I have never fought the battle right?Either way I guess it would just be nice to be with someone who wanted me around. Who maybe was not repulsed by me at least once.That might help me avoid the inevitable.. at this point. Loneliness really does feel like a slowacting poison,Suicidal
15400,15420,Going to be post progress on it Progress coming soon,Suicidal
15432,15452,i cannot feel any sense of joy. i want to say i have not been happy since early 2017 when I was still 14. i try to do pleasurable things and accumulate positive experiences like my fuckin dbt manual tells me to but nothing helps or offers a reprieve. i lie and put on a fake smile and tell people that I am having a good time but I am not genuine. i just do not want to be seen as an ungrateful rude bitch. whenever I am doing anything that is supposed to be pleasurable i would rather be lying in bed with all the lights off. because whatever it is it cannot make me happy it does nothing but sap me of my emotional energy. i have a lovely girlfriend who is an absolute angel but i feel nothing when I am with her. even she does not make me happy and that makes me feel evil.it is midnight where i am and i am listening to Wham!'s Last Christmas and crying. i just need to accept that i am never going to be happy and either learn to live with that or make my plan to sylvia plathmyself. life is suffering anhedonia has got me wanting to attempt again,Suicidal
15449,15469,I do not know what to do. I am 25 and in the worst relationship I can imagine. My only goal was to be happy but it has not worked that way. I feel unwanted. I feel lost. I feel alone. I feel confused. I feel scared. I am do not know who or how to say this to anyone and I just do not know I am so fucking sad. 25 mI genuinely feel lost.,Suicidal

15493,15513,Who would sweep the gun from my hands wrestle the knife away from my unyielding grip? Who would halt my leaving who would prevent me from diving off the bridge downtown? Or better yet find me under the bridge before I give my life away RHCP style? who is going to stop me from driving my car at literal breakneck speeds until I finally hit something and total everything my car myself. Who would stop me from drifting down the expansive river in the style of Ophelia? Who will swing me away from the Highway side late at night when the drunkards are out to wreck and kill? Who will stop me? Who will save me? Who would stop me?,Suicidal
15522,15542,RantSometimes when i get even more depressed than i already am think to myself suicides is an option it gives me alittle relief to know that even if i will not or do go through with it. it is always on the table. Yes i have family but mostly narcissist. I get tired everyday. Sometimes i think sooner or later ill end it but why cannot it be painless? Sorry just babbling. Suicide is an option????,Suicidal
15530,15550,Some people legitimately only show you love and concern when they suspect that you are suicidal as soon as they realize that you are not they go straight back to being apathetic again.I hate this so fucking much. Seriously. Either you care about me or you do not. Pick one I hate how some people only care about you when they think you are suicidal,Suicidal
15574,15594,I am fine thank you ladies codeampx200BMy tears are blinding me again in case I see you again. Without me knowing time has flown by.

And like this another day goes by.I cry just for today. I hope you are forever happy good bye. it is okay if you smile sometimes when you think of me. I am fine thank you thank you.While living as if nothing happened you may even forget me. When you think of me very occasionally I am doing well so you do not need to worry.When it gets tough and you miss me so much I will be the wind and ease your pain. When you call out my name at that hill I will run to you and hug you tight...I cry just for today. I hope you are forever happy good bye. it is okay if you smile sometimes when you think of me.

15660,15680,I am almost 18 and although I was quite popular in high school I have never had a gf. I was wondering if its worth going on just to have that experience. I am just looking for reasons to stay Is love worth living for?,Suicidal
15685,15705,I am tired of everything i tried everything and my life still seems to go fucked up. My 2nd cousin died 1 week ago i think about her a lot did not use to talk with her a lot but still... Just a thought how would i see myself die she died in a car accident with her family and few friends. How will i die seeing cracks in the ceiling or faces above me. 2 weeks ago i broke off with my relationship partner only one that seemed to care you know you value those how are you and goodnight texts time to time when you do not get them. I left my friend and not a single one seemed to care i have not spoken to them in 2 weeks and still no one messaged me about how are you. My guitar string also broke it seems like everything is going downhill life does not seem appealing anymore it is just eating shiting drinking to stay alive.. there is not a single one who would give a shit about me if i die my mom and dad also do not give a shit my dad even said he wished he had an abortion and mom too does not give a shit feels kind of sad that the people who brought you in this world does not care if you die or live because they did not wanted you in the first place. I also have financial problems. I wished someone would ask me about how are you doing time to time. I know that is kind of a lot to ask someone to care for you and give some time from their life to you i know that is a lot caring for someone on this earth which consist of 8 billion like you and even better than you but still... It would have been... Good to have someone like that.My parents are aguring downstairs and my guitar string is broken so i cannot even play that to distract me but i guess i do not need distraction from problems i need freedom. Been a while since life has appealed to me stuff just is moving around head like endless rain to a paper cup. it is just noise and abstract colour flowing. It does not even have inherit meaning to it. just stuff... Feels alone... Could have had quick death like my cousin or headshot on the face.kind of sad that my last words are to beach of random people on the internet and no one near to me. Cracks on the ceiling do seem good though. Been a long while.... Cracks on the ceiling,Suicidal
15687,15707,I am utterly alone. I did not harass anyone... did not even know I broke a rule. Breaking mom has broken me... Who am I kidding. I am already broken. I will leave you alone. I will go where I am wanted. Which is nowhere. I should just hang myself before I collect more people who hate me. I tried taking a bottle of pills but all that did was have me puking all night. I need a gun. Woke up to see I am banned from the only place I had to vent.,Suicidal
15728,15748,I am so numb for so many years. It seems easier just to end everything I am not sure if i can live any longer,Suicidal
15753,15773,I am pretty much at a low point maybe not my lowest.... but who cares?I am done I am over itSocietal pressures still reign over me I do not want to appear weakBut I do not feel I know I have to business or reason for being hereNo friends or anyone to help meWhat's even the point anymoreHow can I just leave gracefully?Why do strangers feel the need to keep me here?Suffrage is temporary I know.... but it ALWAYS returnsI now understand the meaning of money does not buy happinessI have a gaping void inside and will never be filledI long for a connectionA connection that will never be achieved.......God please bless my soul...... I am done,Suicidal

15807,15827,I got fucking drunk because i was borend and proceeded to call a friend tell him I feel suicidal and fucking harmed myself when I was on face time with him he called some friends of mine and they are all worried.I even told him the date I was supposed to kill myself. I hate this they all want to tell my parents so now I am obligated to tell them and feel even more suicidal than before. F16 i got drunk and cut myself on facetime with a friend,Suicidal
15837,15857,I did not ask to be born I did not ask to live this life everyone blames me for the problems that my abusive mother generated and continues to generate nobody understands me nobody wants to understand my anxiety nor be by my side nobody wants to tell me that everything will be alright I am so lonely I am so depressed I just want to stop existing I wish I never existed I do not know what I am doing here. What am I doing here,Suicidal
15864,15884,SI has flared up and I have turned inwards In darkness of my own creation,Suicidal
15866,15886,I call being clairvoyant an untreated mental illness because I am correct in the things that I know and that is not in the DSM V. It seems impossible to take me seriously when I say all this so...I am going to kill myself soon. Like next week soon. But I can prove that I am clairvoyant if people just listened to me. For example I will just say this if a flight record of a Gulfstream V jet landing in Detroit on May 18th 2017 is discovered which it would be if looked into then that proves I am what I say I am. I am not going to say why this jet being in Detroit on that date needs to be looked into because it will not get me taken seriously. Which no one is going to do here anyway because I said I was clairvoyant. It would be nice if that got looked into. I want to die because I cannot handle being clairvoyant anymore.,Suicidal
15894,15914,Many people say that you should not commit suicide because there are always people who would miss you.And I ask myself Where are these people? Why should I stay alive if nobody cares if I am dead?My family often told me it would be better without me they are never happy with what I do. I never had any friends. There is no one else who could miss me. Why should I stay alive then? If I do not want it myself either? No one cares if I am alive so why should I stay?,Suicidal
15918,15938,.. my life..... the pain.... loss.... abandonment...... Not good enough..... alone..I am not even alive at this point besides physically...Just here for my cats.....Maybe they would live better elsewhere... I just want it to end,Suicidal
16028,16048,My life sucks. And I mean it really sucks. I have been hating my life since i was 8. At no point has it ever looked up until now but that is complicated I am forcing myself to make friends. And I am getting emotionally attached to this girl. My significant other kind of blows me off frequently. I am falling for this girl. I do not think it will ever happen but we are incredibly close. She did start crushing on my friend though. I have spend hours every day talking with her. I genuinely hated being alone. I am glad I have her as a friend. 78yo sexually abused Start to identify as trans but its a little early so its not as acceptible so i have to hide it in and out of fostercare for a few years. Complex mental health issues had already started. 15yo used by a 25yo. Things get really bad. 23yo I continue the cycle that happened to me at 15. get busted. Spend a year in prison 3 years on probation. 29yo now. All I have are my friends and I am positive they will just abandon me as per usual. Still dysphoric as hell. High double digit suicide attempts. 10 or so ICU visits. let us just say its complicated. I want to self harm I have all these feelings I am incapable of dealing with. I fell for a girl I should not have. I do not cheat. But I cannot control my heart or my emotions. I feel a natural chemistry. its possible that my romantic feelings are just misattribution since I am unused to any affection intimacy anyone caring etc you get the point. So I will just assume the feelings are real. I have the feeling that shits going to blow up soon. Why does she have to like my friend. We met her at the same time. This is the first person who I have told most of my story to. She did not pull away. I am lost self harm could help me find my way. Clarity is always higher after the suicide attempt would be nice if I would stop failing. Afterwards everything is simpler for months after. I am grey like a walking zombie. I have been ready to die most of my life. I just do not know what to do. what is the point.,Suicidal
16099,16119,my sister just left. i barely get to see her. she only came here on wednesday and now she is gone on sunday. she lives hours away from me. i miss her so fucking much.we had a barbecue planned and my friends were going to come over and we were going to have so much fun. now its been cancelled for the third time because my mum feels ill.i have nothing to stay here for. I am so close to crying. I am so close to offing myself. seriously. i cannot do this anymore,Suicidal
16136,16156,I should have never gotten rid of my rope. Recently got diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and I am coming to the sad reality that this is something Ill have to live with for the rest of my life. I have already dealt with years of torture. The paranoia delusions hallucinations will always be there. Add on top of that all the negative symptoms. Wishing I were dead constantly. Feeling so alone and isolated from the world. Not getting pleasure out of anything. The list goes on and on. Think I need to use the last bit of money I have left to buy another rope. I fucked up,Suicidal
16139,16159,I have had such severe trauma. Sexual and otherwise. I have bipolar and PTSD. I go to therapy and see a psychiatrist weekly. I do not know why I should keep trying. I am a burden. A flawed specimen. Logically I should be dead. All I am now is a burden on my husband family and society. Try to tell me otherwise. I am so tired.,Suicidal
16153,16173,Someone please tell me something. Please. I feel like shit right now someone please see this and say something. Give me a reason to live. Please Someone give me a reason to continue,Suicidal

16244,16264,I do not know what to do Again morning anxiety and suicidal thoughts,Suicidal
16271,16291,There are multiple ways to kill yourself just a lot of them take a long time and hurt like hell. I do not have access to a gun the quickest way out. It would suck surviving. There is a moment of falling before hitting the ground if you jump. Over the last year and a half I made up my mind about going it is just a matter of how and when. Why is it so difficult? Hanging also takes time and is painful. I Wish It Was Easier.,Suicidal
16374,16394,one reason I am glad my attempts have not worked is because my suicide notes suck. like those would not have made my family feel any better. i could not even put in effort to that come on past me aaah,Suicidal
16378,16398,I deleted my vent account because I thought Id never need to post on it again but I was wrong. I just got out of the mental hospital 2 days ago and I am already suicidal again. i do not want it to get to the point where I actually attempt to kill myself like last time though because if I fail I have to go back to the hospital then the mental hospital. I had to promise like a million times that Id tell my parents if I feel suicidal again but I do not want to tell my mom because I do not want to worry her. What should I do? I do not want to go back to the mental hopsital but I am feeling suicidal,Suicidal
16393,16413,29yo male. Feeling numb and hopeless. My life is not the greatest right now drifted from friends single childless isolated and alienated not many prospects I can only see the darkness in life atm. Might be a trope but the only reason I have not done it yet is that I am very close to my elderly parents especially my mother who doted on me being 'mum' is a large part of her identity and it would destroy them. Felt down in the past but never like this. Strong antihistamines mixed with a strong megadose opioid is looking more like rest everyday. Not really looking for advice just felt like talking into the void Feeling suicidal for the first time in my life,Suicidal
16399,16419,I told my wife about my attempts a few weeks ago. I felt guilty hiding it. Now she is just going on and on about me being admitted. How can I talk her down or out of it? I need to get her to understand I am not going to do it now. Opening up advice,Suicidal
16427,16447,hello friends.i slit a lot today. more than ever. i sewed up the bad ones I am not dying tday unfortunately. but the pain and the blood letting it is almost enough to distract myself from the bigger issues. the wine helps getting to the dizzy phase but unfortunately that is as far as I am capable of going. because I am weak. the only girl who ever loved me is gone. she left a lot of stinging words. that i probably deserve. she will find someone else. i will not. I am going to stay right here until it stops. my turn to post,Suicidal
16440,16460,Being in the same mindset as a lot of you guys I too see the world as bleak meaningless amp repetitive. Thoughts lead me here amp I have read many posts for months. Seems as if the thing holding a lot of us back is the trauma it would because the ones closest to us and the fact that we would not want that sadness to fall upon them for as long as they are around to think about it. But my creative mind thinks about a scenario where what if one day every human being on earth were all to be visited by something at the exact same time something like an alien glowing cloud or futuristic looking AI idk. Something we can tell is not of earth but something more powerful This being explains that every human is simultaneously having the same interaction around the globe. They then tell us their sole purpose for coming today is to give each person a choice stay put where we are currently amp continue our regular lives or we could choose the gift of death no strings attached just death. They cannot explain what it is to us but if we accept we get to leave earth amp go wherever real death is. It would be painless quick and take no more effort than just stepping thru a void the alien has opened would you walk thru? Not knowing what death has in store would you take the step forward being thankful that now at least your loved ones will understand that you took the opportunity a lot of other humans from around the world probably took or would you decide to stay amp live this seemingly pointless life? Just a random movieish idea I thought of that would at least eliminate some of the passed down trauma. They would at least understand that you along with however many other people decided the same were not interested in life here anymore amp wanted another option wanted a way out. Would you?,Suicidal
16485,16505,the sadness is constricting my chest. not even the most basic of words can escape my lips i feel powerless and too heavy for my weak body. my mind is numbed. i want it to end. mute,Suicidal
16488,16508,Heads was go through with it tails was to not go through with it..... it landed on heads everytime I have flipped it. Idk what to think about this. Flipped a coin to determine if I should end myself or if I should not.,Suicidal
16533,16553,have not been with a girl in over a year have not had a gf in 4 years no sex in 3. went on a date last night which was horrible and have not had any other success and just have no friends in general been feeling like I am going to eventually just live alone forever and instead of living like that would rather just kill myself now so I do not have to deal with that pain. Only problem is I probably ever will not bc I have a cat who I love and I still have my parents who I love and cannot make them go through that but if they did not exist Id definitely do it. Therapy does not work and I have tried all the meds out there. Fml Probably should just Kms now instead of being alone for the rest of my life,Suicidal
16582,16602,I wish I just had the guts to do it. Years of trying to change things does not do anything. I did everything they told me to do. I have tried it all. Meds getting a new job leaving a bad relationship trying to reconnect with family nothing is the same as it was even last year two years ago ten years ago nothing except how miserable I am. How much I hurt physically emotionally mentally only that is the same. Only that continues to prove to me that I will not ever feel any better. I am trapped in this awful life I never asked for and nothing but death can get me out of this pain. it is not going to stop. Over and over I come back here,Suicidal
16599,16619,I am taking in someone who overdosed purposely today. Her home life is not safe so I am bringing her to my home .

16829,16849,They left for a honeymoon and they will be gone for a week. it is the perfect amount of time where I can finish up my notes and kill myself. I already have the method. I do not know. Something about me finally having had enough and ending it while they are off in paradise gives me some sort of relief. They would be having the time of their life and they would not even know till they got home a week later. My parents are both gone for a week and I think I am going to kill myself.,Suicidal
16837,16857,I have had suicidal thoughts almost my entire life. I am 29 now and the idea is more powerful and I can imagine myself doing it. Although I am scared of going through with it. I practiced strangling myself to see if I can prepare myself to do it. After one attempt I realized there will be some suffering if I do it. What are some powerful techniques to calm me down and control it?so I can continue my life with some peace Advice for how to cope with suicidal ideation and any life advice,Suicidal

16951,16971,I just sit here everyday. Doing nothing. Accomplishing nothing. By the time its 1 AM or 4 AM I am in bed crying wondering why I am still alive and scrolling to find some aid on assisted suicide. I have tried suicide hotlines but they never seem to be able to help me. I have had someone hang up on me before. It was after my father snapped at me and called me ugly that I started questioning whether or not I deserved to live. Everyday he would degrade how I look. I was already aware of it. My teeth are rotten I have a gap in the middle of my teeth I am obese have skin illnesses causing it to look disgusting and wrinkly and my skin tone is dark meaning I am already ugly to many. Being ugly is just a death sentenceI wish my facade of I do not care what people think about me was true but it was not.I have been having other health issues but I cannot afford to go to a doctor or get therapy. I have anxiety every single day. I cannot ever sleep because recurring nightmares. When I need to take medication I cannot even take a single pill because my gag reflexes and anxiety. Pretty sure I also have undiagnosed ADHD. I want to go to the doctor but I fear just being forced to take pills or medicine.My parents get mad at me for not being able to do anything because of my crippling depression but my agoraphobia is extreme. I never want to go outside. I never want anybody to see me. I feel ashamed at my parents just looking at me. I hate my body and everything about it. I barely take care of my body anymore because of the hate I have for it.If I could say one accomplishment it would be that I finished college with bachelors of fine arts but I am getting nowhere in my life. I used to be able to do so many illustrations for clients but I have not been able to focus or motivate myself and it is causing me extreme distress. I am in so much debt on work I owe for my clients but I just cannot complete them no matter how hard I try. I tried recently applying for my dream job and I also managed to get it but I was laid off in a few days because my boss wanted to go travel the world instead of work. I am still stuck in crippling student debt from this with no way of paying it backAll of this just tells me that I am a failure as a human being. My parents constantly tell me that. My sister does not even talk to me anymore and we used to be so close. I used to have friends irl but they just stopped talking to me after college. I tried to ask someone for help saying I am suicidal and lost and all they said was mmm okay? I lost hope in them. It just feels like nobody cares about me and I do not want to be a waste of space anymore. My body is dying and I see no hope of me improving anytime soon. I still have dreams and wishes but life does not want me here. I do not know what to do. I want my work ethics back. I want to be healthy. I want to feel like I belong but it is so hard. I have wishes and dreams but life does not want me here.,Suicidal
16968,16988,so I never felt this low ever I feel numb unmotivated unable to do anything that makes me happy I feel nauseous all the time and so sick today was supposed to be fun I am on vacation but of course everything went wrong for me everyone looks so happy like their life is just so fucking perfect I wish I was one of them my parents will not let me go anywhere or even cry I feel trapped they deny that depression exists and say that its just sadness and it will go away I have tried to tell them that I need help and I am not okey that I am depressed but ofc they just laugh at me. They make suicide jokes and think its funny. I do not want to die I just want to feel happy again like when I was little. Everyone tells me its going to be ok but when ? I just want a hug from someone telling me that its going to be ok and that I do not have to cry and that I am not alone. I try to keep motivated and tell myself that its going to be ok and that it will pass and to just do good stuff to forget it but it never goes away. why am i still here?,Suicidal
16969,16989,This past year has been full of negative people and negative situations. I graduated college as covid hit. Found out that was a huge waste of time and money. Almost everyday an old person tells me there is nothing to look forward to. I have been working hard and doing really great for people and their businesses yet they are very negative and only care about money and their old asses. Smoking marijuana no longer gets me high so I am either searching for a better high or searching for a reason to quit trying. How is a 23 year old suppose to make it in this world? People live so long and they are not grateful or nice to the younger generation. I have tried being hateful but I am so tired. All I want to do is smile and enjoy my time on this earth. Tired,Suicidal
16988,17008,I am really depressed right now and I just feel like something is off. Like my vibes are wrong. Idk if that even makes sense. I just want to calm down I might have an anxiety attack or am currently having one. I literally feel like I could cry I do not know what to do. Can someone try to calm me down,Suicidal
17002,17022,I have had? severe eczema since I was a child but this past spring really kicked my ass. Appointment after appointment and I am now HAPPY with my skin being clear but suffering through all the side effects magnified somehow. Doctors said keep taking it or do not. Suffer with the medication or suffer with my eczema. There is no win there. And now after a week of hip pain and leg pain they are saying I have a spinal arthritis???? And I cannot take pain meds because my other medication interferes with it. My body fucking hurts but my skin is clear? My skin is clear but now I have hot flashes joint pain nausea?? And chasing around a toddler is literally putting me in even more pain. My quality of life was supposed to get better and it did in one way but got worse in others. I had so much hope for my life to turn around this summer and upcoming months especially since I am finally starting university after being in city college for 8 years. I feel like if I keep going I am just going to suffer more and I am becoming more and more hopeless. I had so much hope honestly that my shit was going to get better but everything is just crashing down on me and I cannot do anything anymore. Getting out of bed literally hurts so what is the point of all of it?? Its just one thing after another idk how much more I can take Feeling hopeless and tired after more medical issues,Suicidal
17130,17150,I am always reminding myself of how I regret not taking the chance of killing myself when I was younger. I have a wonderful boyfriend amp 2 pets but I cannot help to think it would have been better if I just went through with it I would not be in so much pain. Constantly reminding myself of the abuse I went through amp having to act like I am fine when I have unprocessed trauma and a family who could careless. I am an over thinker so I have gone over this process multiple times I have covered every possible out come if I do not kill my self. I have not felt like myself in a few years I just feel lost and like I am watching my life over my body. I have already thought about therapy but talking about my problems have never fixed it I just want my mind to be quiet amp silent for once. I am tired,Suicidal
17140,17160,Depressed for 11 years ugly virgin no energy or pleasure ever all jobs suck everything is mainly boring self improvement is boring and i do not feel rewarded ever no one likes me not even me I am rude to many people so God damn tired of life If I could press a button to die rn I would,Suicidal
17174,17194,i know this sounds so weird but i love feeling hopeless and suicidal. it is so freeing because i can do anything i want since i know that i have nothing to lose. being happy makes me anxious because I am just waiting for the next thing in my life to go wrong. i love being suicidal,Suicidal
17178,17198,In a few months time i will officially claim the 'adult' title like a huge Congrats! You made it through childhood. Get ready for the deep end and welcome to a world of finance unnecessarily long work shifts ready to give your hand in marriage and the expectation that it will all go smoothly type of thing. it is the summer holidays i finished my first year of college with my last year waiting on the horizon. Basically managed to pull reasonable scores on my tests that were extremely underwhelming to what my predicted grades were but with halfassed halffinished assignments what else was i to expect? Cried an unnecessary amount of times and skipped multiple classes on the panicinduced decisions of having my mind blanc out and forgetting which room my lectures were held in. I hate it. I hate life. I hate myself. I hate everything that was and is to come. How am i going to live in a society where people expect so much of me when i cannot even get through my academic years smoothly. People advise me to do my best when me trying my best is doing the bare fucking minimum. I give up. I am incapable of doing such simple things. I cannot fucking stand it. And i do not plan on experiencing life past 18. Adulthood sucks and I am not even there yet. In a few months i will officially be an adult. I am not ready and i never will be.,Suicidal
17184,17204,Earlier this year my long term girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me. I was really shocked by this and still think I am in denial that were not together. she is already dating someone else but still wants to be my friend. I was convinced and certain she was the one and I am struggling to move on. Every time I think of dating or hooking up with someone else I get sad and uncomfortable. How have you rebuilt your life after a breakup with someone you were so certain about? How to get over someone you were so certain was The One?,Suicidal
17188,17208,I do not even feel like I have much left to say.. I am just tired of dealing with everything by myself. I just want to give up.,Suicidal

17246,17266,I fucking did it again. I hurt someone again and left them miserable. I am tired of this bullshit. I cannot believe I made them feel comfortable talking to me and hurt them in the end. Who the fuck is giving me the right and freedom to hurt and disappoint people? Never have I been able to make someone happy. Not once. Even in the slightest bit. Might as well end it guys. Failed the first two times. Third time is the charm. To the people I hurt I am genuinely sorry. I am not nice to be around. I am out. I did it again.,Suicidal

17288,17308,I feel unstable and unable to be on my own at the momentThis week has been bad for me. I am suffering from a lot of trauma and for some reason its all surfacing this week. I scratched my roommate severely during a panic attack in which he was helping me. Its a huge scratch and is going to scar. He called 911 because of me. Last night I had suicidal thoughts and could not be separated from him. I have slept in the same bed as him for the past week. I cannot be away or else my mind wanders and last night I was feeling suicidal. I am so terrified my girlfriend is going to leave me for literally no reason. Were happy and love each other. My therapist cancelled our session today because she is sick and I feel like that is the only thing that could have calmed me down. I do not know what to do I feel unstable and unable to be on my own at the moment,Suicidal
17291,17311,I am a 27 yr old woman. Bc of the pandemic and stuff I had to move back in with my parents. My step dad was very inappropriate with me as a teen. My mom blamed me for it and is still married to him. I have to see him every day bc I do not have anywhere else to live. I am the first person in my family to graduate college. I recently got a new good paying job but I work from home and do not get my first paycheck until August bc it is monthly pay. I do not have enough money to leave yet. My bio dad was in prison for manufacturing most of my life he just married a woman he is known for a few weeks and is raising her kid now. I have nightmares all the time. I am in therapy. Last night I had a dream I had my own house but lost my job so my mom told me to move back in with her and my step dad. In my dream I unalived myself so I would not have to see him again. I woke up in my parents house and my step dad was in the living room. I feel like my waking life is worse than that dream. I cannot afford to go out or drink or smoke right now. I have not left the house in many days and will not be able to until Sunday when I babysit for a little cash for gas and cigs. I just have to deal with it.I know I will be able to leave by the end of the year. But I do not know if I will make it that long having to see my step dad every day. I feel so isolated I only have my dog to talk to really. No one else likes me to talk about this stuff. He started drinking again too. I am so scared I am not safe here. I do not want to be me anymore. I am so alone,Suicidal
17305,17325,Just want to check out and go away I am tired of the bullshit do not want to do the whole life thing anymore,Suicidal
17329,17349,i see so much suffering here and just like... what can i do?? how to offer support??,Suicidal
17335,17355,I am so tired of having to deal with depression. Sometimes things get good but it always goes back to shit. I want to die. I just think that it is my destinyfate to commit suicide. I do not see a future for me. And as much as I want to do some good in this world I am just so damn tired of fighting these battles in my head. I am tired,Suicidal
17339,17359,Recently I have had multiple things come up in my life that has made me think about wanting to cut again. I have not done it yet because I promised myself years ago that I would not do it again but rn I am hurting so bad I feel like shit almost everyday and no one seems to care or notice. Its building up. Today it got so bad my sister knew I was not in the best of moods and just kept poking at me and trying to make me argue with her. I gave her multiple warnings to try and get her to stop tryna argue because it was so early in the morning and I was not in a good mood and she did not and I just blew up on her. I could not hold back and I just took that as a way to let go of all my built up anger. I feel bad about it and I know it was wrong to use violence but I just could not control my emotions. It just is not a good day for me. I am sad. Then again a lot of days are not good for me. I just let things build up and explode when I finally had enough. I am not okay. My house is so toxic I just want to take my son and go but I cannot because I have no career and I am trying to get my license atm and also in school. Its going to take time. I wish money could just fall into my lap so I can handle my responsibilities and so I can get out of this toxic household. I just want a peaceful life with my son. I am not okay,Suicidal
17343,17363,Been suicidal for years due to circumstances. Antidepressants do not work therapy is useless and these are not the kind of circumstances that change with time. Really running out of options. Running out of options.,Suicidal
17360,17380,I do not even know what love feels like. A pointless existence I am killing myself very soon,Suicidal
17373,17393,I am so tired and exhausted every single day. I am 21 F living with my toxic family. My father died when I was 18. But I was not close to him. We barely had a relationship. He never really cared about kids. My earliest memory of my childhood is of him getting angry about some random thing and throwing away the food on the table and then hitting my mother. I have seen my mother get beaten up ever since I was a kid. She would hit him back while trying to defend herself. They would threaten to kill each other during fights. Kid me would try desperately to loosen my father's fists clenching my mother's hair. But I was just a small kid with no physical strength so I could not do much except beg and cry for them to stop hurting each other. This was long ago.One day my grandmother father's side died and I guess something triggered within my dad even tho he was not close to her AT ALL and he lost his shit. He started behaving erratically. Few weeks later we find out through an office colleague of his that my father had been fired from his work. We had no idea. He used to go to work everyday in the morning. Turns out he was just pretending. Through this said colleague we got to know more he had angry outburst at work spouting weird stuff. After some more strange incidents not going into details we got an appointment with a psychiatrist and my dad was later diagnosed with schizophrenia. This was when the domestic abuse hit its peak. He became way more violent. I remember one day he broke my mother nose and she started bleeding. Fast forward to 23 years I have no sense of time really it all seems like a blur now he stopped taking his meds became super submissive barely said anything. I realised eventually that he was depressed exhibited all the signs. Things changed. Now my mother became the abuser. She would tell him to die how useless he was what a burden he was on us 247. She also started hitting him. I tried to stop. My father did not. He would just sit there and let her do it. I have an elder brother too but he had gone for college so I was the only one who had to witness all of this all alone with no help. This lasted for some time until he actually listened to her. He killed himself around a week after my 18th birthday. My mother found his body in the middle of the night.I am glad he is dead. At least he does not have to suffer anymore. I do not know.But now years after all of this shit things somehow seem to have worsened if that is even possible . I used it believe that once my father was gone from the picture things would be better. We could lead a peaceful life. Oh boy was I wrong! My mother's toxicity oozed out. I think I have become the replacement of my father. Everyday it is the same thing. I am a useless worthless piece of shit. A waste of space. How she regrets giving birth to me. How I am a crazy person who need help... and more. Manipulation gaslighting mental emotional physical abuse you name it she got it. I have and still am faced it all. I try my best to do all the chores and not make her angry but it never matters. She will find something to mock taunt and insult me. I have no place or privacy to cry. it is shit.I have kept alllll this shit inside of me without a single soul knowing until recently. I told me best friend. Well not everything but I gave a general overview. But I keep stopping myself from saying anything about the present times because it is all so intense and I do not think she would be able to handle all this. Even I cannot. Everyday is the same. I am so fucking exhausted and tired of everything. I wish I could kill myself but I have wayy too much hope to do it. I truly want to live a happier healthier life because I deserve it. I deserve love and care. But my god this is difficult. 21 years of trauma and I do not see an end to it. I wish I would cease to exist. Why is killing yourself so hard? I am dead inside. I need help but there is nothing. I have no motivation to do anything. No purpose in life. Sometimes I think I might be depressed but then again I am able to get up do my chores. I do not know. I have also started seeing signs of trauma during arguments and confrontations and it scares me. Nothing seems to be go right in my life. Everything is a fucked up mess. When will this end? P. S. If you are still reading this fucked up tragedy of a life story what is wrong with you? Lol. Thank you for reading. I swear the Universe has a vendetta against me,Suicidal
17378,17398,I was doing so good. I felt so hopeful about life. I saw a future for myself and I was so happy. Now I am back to feeling shitty day by day. I do not know what flipped the switch. It could be anxiety about money school trauma dysphoria or just some kind of stupid hormonal imbalance. I have been suicidal since I was 12. Once I realized I am trans I thought that was why. Especially since I started feeling a lot better once I started accepting that I am a guy. But lately I have felt so awful. Everything feels so hopeless and like too much. I am not going to do it but I am scared bc the thoughts are back and came back hard. I think I might even feel more peace if I knew I was going to do it. Some sort of comfort that I could be gone soon instead of knowing that I am going to sit here and feel like shit until I feel better again. I think I must be mentally ill. I read a book recently that is described how I have felt for a long time and everyone says the mc is mentally ill. Everyone says that most people do not start wanting to die whenever they start feeling too sad. I have been trying so hard to work on myself and make things better. I wish I could just feel okay and never feel like this again. I thought I was done with this. I feel like I am being dramatic and should just get over this but I do not even want to be feeling like this. I spent so many year trying to pretend I was okay and think positive and force myself to be okay and it did not even fucking work. If I told my family they would expect me to just journal and just not think about it and be okay but I have tried that. Something is wrong with me. What the fuck am I supposed to do Not okay right now. Please someone just be here,Suicidal
17398,17418,If a man has no purpose his life is just a continuous death i have no purpose so what is the point,Suicidal
17436,17456,Hi. When I was 18 I was depressed. To continue to life I promise myself that I will not kill myself until I would become 25 years old because I know that after 25 there will not be huge change in my life. Today is my 25th birthday. As I expected nobody celebratedI do not know use this word correctly. Thus after today I can suicide whenever I want. I do not have to wait for anything. Now I can suicide whenever I want.,Suicidal
17505,17525,I failed my senior year and now I am 18 in summer school making no progress because I am so burned out and depressed. I have so much to do with nobody to help me and I have so little time to even do fun things. I do not have a learners permit or a license so I cannot even go anywhere to clear my mind. I want to just stop and kill myself already. I am to a point where I am bored of everything. I am gay so I have never had a relationship as it feels impossible for me to even try without my license. I feel like a complete fucking train wreck. I am tired all the time I am lonely I just want to dropout of school and just fucking die in a hole. I do not know what to do. I am so lost the one guy I thought liked me ghosts me now and I am just thinking about how I wish I could disappear. I am tired. I am tired of stress loneliness and self hatred. I just want to live a life I enjoy but everything I do feels pointless. I cannot find reason to even try anymore.,Suicidal
17524,17544,I am back to this sub after two years of joy. More hopeless than before. Contrary to the advice I have given the suffering never ends. Once again my empathy will not shut the fuck up and let me go out peacefully. Its always the burden Ill put on my family for it rather than what I want. two years of peace,Suicidal
17550,17570,I was very happy recently but I was hesitant on whether it was worth it or not. But I know the answer now. And I have never actually seriously thought Id kill myself but now I am convinced its how I am supposed to die. I have no idea how to do it and I am scared it will hurt but Ill find a way. I wished people listened to me more when I told them I hurt instead of rolling their eyes and calling me a burden but whatever. I know they will feel guilty but I am not responsible for their feelings anymore. I am going to do it.,Suicidal
17574,17594,I was pretty much suicidal consistently since 2016. I went through another breakup recently which again made me spiral. Thankfully there was a therapy session right after. She gave me a lot of pointers on how to tackle my trauma of abandonment and neglect and general feeling of loneliness. And I went through so much shit in the past 2 years in my relationships that this session just woke me up from my slumber. Like I am done feeling this way. I am done giving my energy to people who do not deserve it. For some reason I do not give a damn about relationships anymore and the very thought of it exhausts me and now I finally feel free. Like I finally feel like I can live my life and direct energy to myself and I do not owe anyone anything. I do not have to spend time deliberating if I mean anything to anyone. I do not have to obsess and overthink like I am over everything. I just do not care and I want to take care of myself and spoil myself and for the first time like I actually want to live!! Like I want to live my life not giving a shit about anyone else or what anyone else thinks of me or being desperate for a relationship or some form of Connection. I am done feeling this way and ever since my therapy I have only felt excited to live my life as a single person and I am so ready !!! Finally leaving this group,Suicidal
17589,17609,I hate this world and all the systems devised by humans in power. I am glad and fortunate for what I have but I get older every day while I watch people younger than me succeed and have relationships good jobs or a great education without even trying or having hardships. I just do not connect with people like the rest of the world and I am doomed to go it alone forever. it is very very lonely. Even tried dating websites but they all grub money and do not let you talk for free. there is no point to keep trying so I look up ways to die online but it is not as simple as it may seem. And so I go on alone trying and failing for what purpose? I have a roof over my head and internet so I just play games and browse... Alone.... 26f been alone entire life,Suicidal
17604,17624,cannot kill myself because I love my momThis world sucks ass I cannot,Suicidal
17609,17629,I have written so many words and lengthy cathartic monologue's to myself over the years that they are not really cutting it anymore. The words I use are old and they do not quite cover my feelings anymore. I have watched everyone surprass me. I have been used up and discarded more times than I care for at this point. I have nothing but the storm of hate and despair that I feel all the time now. I am so angry and so lost. I have no hope and I have exhausted most of my options of selfhelp. I can always continue and always survive but I am not really progressing and I am not really becoming what I want to become. I cannot get a job I have been denied University funding my wife did not want me and I am stuck in my childhood home of abuse. I cannot seem to make money online anymore and those options are few anyway. I have used up all the limited help there is and I do not really see a way to proceed anymore. I am thinking that perhaps it is time and maybe it will finally be a relief rather than a regret. it is sad but it is what it is. I think the greatest illusion I ever sold myself is that I was going to be successful. The potential was there but it was too stacked against me and I guess I am not strong enough. At 33 with no income and no accomplishments other than small personal goals I think it might be time to just accept defeat. The path grows darker,Suicidal
17611,17631,This is a suicide note I thinkIve ruined my life. I have made irreversible mistakes that I deserve to be punished for. I am going to kill myself next week. This is it this is the end of my life. I am going to miss my family and friends but I have left myself with no other options. I clearly have no place in this world anymore. I just want to reverse time and go back I want another try at this. I hate that this is how it has to be but I cannot do anything else. Fuck my miserable life. I hate all of this. I am helpless I have no other options,Suicidal
17615,17635,I am a doctor year 2 psychiatric resident and everyday I walk to the clinic and wonder if I should just walk by and find a way to off myself. I cannot stand humans anymore I really only want to be let alone. Already quit my job but it will be end of august until I can leave 3 months notices are cruel but makes sense with callschedules. Ironically I am assigned to a depression ward. It is different than what you may have experienced open friendly spacious nice garden not the US. And I tell my patients to do things to relax help them structure their days with breaks and activities they like. While not having time for a lunch break myself while finishing reports on the weekends... we have this depression questionnaire we make patients fill out every week and I scored about average of my patients moderate to severe depression. it is so fucking funny sometimes. I stress the importance of outpatient follow up and do not have time to see my own therapist. little over a month left they think I will be coming back next year. idkI just need to find a way to earn money without any human contact or else I think I am going to call quits. Interacting with society is making life unbearable for me. What was that clown's name again?,Suicidal
17616,17636,I do not get it. What is the point. Keep living everyday working go home do stuff on the weekends. This has repeated for me so many times. Do what everyone else does? Get married have kids and do the same cycle with extra work and stress? Sure there is good times with having a family but I just see it as a huge pointless cycle. You work and go home. You get married. You work and go home. You have kids. You work and go home. You raise your kids to do the exact same thing when they grow up. And then you die. Like why even continue the cycle? Why not just stop the pointless cycle now? I do not get it. what is the point,Suicidal

When i told them i wanted to kill myself a month ago they screamed at me. I do not feel comfortable telling my friends. I do not want to die but my dad makes my life so awful. I feel like I cannot wait it out until i have enough money to leave him. I think i just want som1 to tell me to keep going. pls help,Suicidal
17687,17707,I do not want to live with my abusive mom anymore. I am 18 but I cannot literally stand on my own because I was forced to live in a strict rules. I do not want to live with my abusive mom anymore. I have two choices. I either kill her or kill myself. I do not want to be a bad person. I want to know what is the least painful and easiest way to commit suicide. I know some people will come and try to comfort me to prevent suicide. I appreciate that. But man think about it. Sometimes words cannot solve the problems. It will just postpone the problems. And there are moments when you get in troubles and do not get the actual help but comforting words. What is the least painful and easiest way to commit suicide?,Suicidal
17702,17722,just let me die let me rot in hell Another Friday night drinking again hoping I just fucking die,Suicidal
17746,17766,I feel very guilty. I have expressed my desire to end my life to my mom and I hate that I am putting her through this. I am going to seek help and try to stay alive. I have been poisoning myself with alcohol in order to speed up the process but it did not work. I am not going to end my life and put her through the grief. If there are any parents who have suicidal children or anybody who has personally experienced suicidal ideation I want to hear from you. Thank you in advance Expressed my intent to kill myself to my mom and...,Suicidal
17772,17792,I have not had a real conversation in months. Every single person I cross paths with just talks at me not to me. I am tired of listening to people constantly talk about shit I do not care about. I am tired of people not picking up on obvious cues that I am not listening. These language games are bullshit. Just another way for people to assert power or pump their ego in front of others. I do not care what you think you know about anything. None of this matters anyway.Silence is not the answer...I know that. Everyone gets lonely. Everyone gets sad. I get lonely I get sad. But I just wish I could sit with someone quietly and chat about things at a gentle pace. Everyone is hammering out words faster than a machine gun and expecting either allegiance or resistance. Everything has to be a fucking battle does not it. A battle you cannot win.Alan Watts was right when he said we do not change. People do not change. A person might go through changes or maybe some kind of conscious progression in life but as a general rule the human race are just a bunch of egoists. You see it in children first and then you realise no one actually outgrows it they just get better at hiding it. No one cares about anything except making sure everyone else around them knows how important they are. I cannot even escape the hypocrisy. I hate being like this surrounded by people like this. On a dying planet to boot.Fuck this shit. I am over it.,Suicidal
17787,17807,I have said goodbye to my British friend and to my Danish friend.One has not read my text yet and the other has not responded to me.Finally a person always has to leave the world alone.At the moment my heart is full of upset and numbness.Three years three years of agony. I imagine myself standing in the wind shrinking and depressed.My hair is dancing in the wind and hell is cracking under my feet.However I wish you could see my text. Although it will not change anything I will be very comforted if I have your words at the end of my life.If there is an afterlife let me be a drop of rain in Britain so that I can fall on your shoulder.I will never forget what you called meMy beautiful girlMiss BeautifulMiss CatIf only I had known you earlier. If there is an afterlife let me be a drop of rain in Britain.,Suicidal

17809,17829,I am a Grandson of suicide I am a son of suicide attempts and I am a survivor of suicide. I work as a caregiver for the elderly and it is been all I have keeping me going. In the last several months it has not been enough all I want to do is give up. I have a plan I just have not figured out how to NOT leave a mess for someone else ruin my apartment etc. Constantly worried about other people I guess. The darkness is happening more and more often and it is harder to come back each time. I have tried reaching out but nothing works. I am exhausted of the fight tired of struggling all the time! I am not afraid of death I have been around it for years. I just want peace finally! Closer and closer,Suicidal
17810,17830,I hold a belt around my neck every night and pull tightly until I feel myself slipping away then I let go. Its how I hurt myself instead of bleeding out and leaving scars that I do not need any more of.One day Ill either let go too late on accident or finally tie it around my throat to kill myself on purpose. Its not actually a very painful feeling... Practicing hanging myself,Suicidal
17836,17856,I know everyone feels unhappy i feel deeply unhappy i feel like my blood is boiling and my brain is rotting i have no other way to describe it.My life was not particularly awful what went wrong?? Why cannot i get the thought of ending it out of my head? I could think about questions all day but it would not be any use.I have permanent ugly disgusting abhorrent scars and i have refused therapy. I almost drank myself into a vegetative state i have no idea what to do from here. I have aspirations dreams and yet something deep and destructive just feels like laying down and dying and taking me with it.Thank you160721 I just feel so unhappy.,Suicidal

I made out the words the police have been informed.. muttered in the distance by her mother. Crying my gf says after this call we cannot talk to eachother... and that they are forcing me to break up with you. She begged that I not come after her. I did my best to remain calm and agreed telling her not to worry or panicshe is been through very bad experiences in the past and suffers from anxiety attacks and depression she also thinks she is causing me trouble all the time I do not want her to hurt herself or worse... now I wait on my porch wondering if Ill see police drive up in a frenzy caused by the lies of a senile and evil woman. Oh god this hurts so much it all happened a few moments ago. Please if you can help me or guide me in the right direction please do. I am considering going guns blazing or putting a bullet in my head. I think a restraining order was put on me I need help,Suicidal

Same goes fr my dad but he is less subtle and straight up says get that thought out of your headIm so loved and supported why cannot I just get up and fucking do something worthwhile. Make my family happy.Only thing I am motivated to do is kill myself but I do not have the discipline to do it yet.Rip me I have never been this down,Suicidal
17920,17940,I am depressed. I have told my parents. They do not believe me. Nothing normal there they do not normally believe me. it is not because I am a liar but because I am 18 so I do not know anything in their minds. they have said so. Everyday has been harder and harder to cope. I cried today because I feel like I am not good enough for my hamster. I climb out my window at 1230 at night and ran back in. After laying down for awhile I got up and I choked myself with ribbon I stopped after a few seconds. I did not realize how bad I was. Of couse I thought about dieing how but I never thought I would act on it. I was spaced out. I just did it. I do not know what to do now. I do not know what to do now,Suicidal
17931,17951,I have made promises to stick around but I cannot any more it is too uncomfortable all the time and I ca never breath and I feel like I want to tear myself apart to let some of the hurt out but It dosent work that way. There is only one way that works. I am too tired to carry on. I am not brave enough to write a suicide letter because I domt have the words to say to the people I love anyway. I am not sure why I am writing this. I am not sure I want help or if anyone can help. Probably they cannot. I think I am probably going to try and hang myself,Suicidal
17938,17958,there are many bad moments in my life. one of these days I plan to kill myself. Hello,Suicidal
17963,17983,I started self harming again I use self harm of a few kinds such as food punishment and gym but I have started physically cutting again and I cannot even feel it anymore. I really feel so done what is more is I get so pissed off at myself how many times I post on here and overthink my post delete it just to post something else another day when I struggle...

18035,18055,Please I need it really badly I just want to be happy forever. Someone give me magic to make me happy,Suicidal
18059,18079,Most people have to work a regular 9 5 More like 9 7 these days to live. No real getting around that. They make money to acquire things that make them happy or engage in activities that make them happy. Literally nothing I can think of feels worth sacrificing most of my life for. If I could just have nothing in exchange for doing nothing in life that would be ok with me I think. I am not materialistic. Everything i own can all be put into two and a half boxes. I do not really find sex as appealing as the rest of society seems to. I could live without it. At the same time traveling seems silly to me to spend months of saved money just to look at some places and take some pictures. Then you have to save and penny pinch for months again to do it again. Not appealing. All I have in life I enjoy are my relationships with my friends but of course as you get older and have to focus on your career and your family and what have you you have less time to hang out. We have to plan weeks in advance just to have some drinks together but in that three weeks life happens and someone cannot come etc etc. I do not have the best family so I only really communicate with my mom on a regular basis. I just do not really see any point in continuing this existence that I feel like I have to force myself through. If I had a dream job or really enjoyed sex or money or any of the things that seem to satisfy everyone else I feel like Id be ok but none of it feels worth it. Life itself does not feel worth it if I have to sacrifice a huge chunk of it to sleep and working. Everything is feeling like too much work. Too many tasks. Too much expectation. Too much bullshit. Hell some days I do not eat because I am just so tired of existing I do not want to do anything. Is there anyone that feels like this? Is there any help? Any chance of escape. God I do not really want to kill myself but I also really no longer wish to continue this existence. I wish there was an easy answer to all this but there is not. Just feels hopeless. Thank you for reading. I felt like I had to just get this out my head or I was going to explode on the inside. I am tired of forcing myself to live a normal existence. Nothing in life seems to bring me enough happiness to want to continue living in this world for it.,Suicidal
18123,18143,When I was 10 I was raped by my older cousin I have wanted to die ever since I have tried it multiple times but have either failed or not gone through with it I do not know what to do anymore I just want to end it all I was raped and want to die now,Suicidal
18130,18150,This is such a trite bullshit phrase used by anti suicide peopleThe help people need is often not available. The working world rules all and does not give allowances for mental health issues until they demand to be taken seriously usually by some act of irreversible damage..In theory I should have support. I see an occupational therapist suspected to have ASDADHD and a counsellor. They can try and work through my issues but they cannot do anything to help with the unrelenting stress of my job. And I cannot afford to quit. Useless. I cannot explain any of my issues to my boss. They have no power to change my job or provide help. Its just not that type of organization. It would be humiliating to discuss this with them too. Stress leave does not really exist. Would have to see a doctor for that. They all say they do not know me well enough to recommend leave. And it would not help me unless it means a change of job. Its useless to talk to my family. They cannot do anything practical. My dad continually downplays my illness or compared to his own or just thinks I get a little depressed. Tells me I should never feel I cannot take a vacation. A totally stupid thing to say. Talking to them usually just makes me angry. Help lines are totally useless. Never a practical suggestion. I just want to end it to prove a point to my father who does not take me seriously my therapist and OT and pysch and everyone else so they know it was serious. I was not faking. I really needed help. big middle finger to my employer. They like to think they are progressive and care about employees mental health. I could seriously embarrass them. let everyone else know how little they meant to me end this charade of working hard to support a life no longer worth living. there is nothing worth the bullshit I put up with. Obviously I want help but it clearly does not exist! And do not bother reporting concern to Reddit what good does that do. ? Ask for help yeah right from who or what ?,Suicidal
18143,18163,I am sorry. I know this is so fucking dumb. I just I do not know why I keep falling so hard for people that do not end up feeling the same about me. I am just so fucking done with being me. I really do not think I am that bad a person but its just happening so consistently and I just cannot be fucked being alive anymore. This is the second time this year that something has happened and ended within two months and I actually feel so fucking low and worthless. How do I keep misreading stuff so much. Like what is actually wrong with me.I just do not want to be here I do not even know what the point is.I am sorry. I do not really feel like I have got anyone I can actually truly open up to so here I am with Reddit. Sorry Posting just because cba with in crisis yknow,Suicidal
18177,18197,They knew I bought suicide drugs. I thank them of course for not taking it away from me.Today we again had an argument and I left the house and took it all with me. I am sitting in the shittiest flat you can possibly imagine no fridge even and crying because none of them called me back. it is 2206 and I rent the flat by 0900. I must kill myself by the morning or I have no else to go and I will not come back. I have got exactly 0 money. I have left my house with my suicide drugs and nobody stopped me. it is night already and none of them care if I die. They do not want me back.,Suicidal

18274,18294,I met this woman off Tinder for a hookup. On my profile I mentioned that I like having sex with women with vaginas after she asked me what my preference was. She never disclosed me that she was a woman with a penis even though she is the one who asked me what my preference was. This woman and I talked and video chatted and met up at a hotel.We were getting undressed then I saw that she had male genitalia. Once I saw this I asked her what was going on?? She told me it does not matter if she had a penis and that sex was sex and she is still a woman. I told her that I was not comfortable and did not want to proceed.Once I did that she completely flipped on me. I tried to leave the room. She would not let me call the front desk or 911. She ripped the phone out my hands and threw it down. She pinned me down on the floor. I tried to fight her off but could not. She entered me then raped me. This was the first time Inhad ever been penetrated. She then Tried to strangle me and I tried screaming as loud as I could. I bit her face as hard as I could and I kicked her in her penis area and ran into the hallway. I was only in panties and a bra. I screamed for helped and yelled FIRE!!!. Three people came out their rooms and tried to help me. I told them I had been raped and beaten.She then ran out the room still trying to charge at me and the guy out of the three had to hold her back. One of the women who came out of her room gave me her robe and slippers and went down with me to the lobby.The hotel manager took me into their office and asked me what happened then called the police. 4 officers showed up.The hookup who raped me came down to the lobby told the police that I was lying and was crazy. I showed them my bruises. They told me they had no proof that she did that and she also told the officer that if they take her to jail then they are violating her human rights because she is a trans woman.They asked me questions and the hotel manager let 2 of the officers get access into the hotel room to try and take evidence but there was none because she raped me on the floor. I said I wanted a rape kit. They said they have no proof that it was not consensual. They took a report but did not take her to jail. I requested an ambulance who took me to the hospital where I received a rape kit. My hookup was never arrested. I am speaking to lawyers now but do not know what to do.I am extremely distressed and mentally compromised. I am with my family now and took screenshots of our texts and app chats.I keep calling the police department and they keep saying that they have forwarded my report to the prosecutor but I have heard nothing back and its been 5 days.This happened in the state of California as I was there visiting a friend for a week.What are my options? What would you do in this situation? I am in desperate need of help! I was raped this past weekend by a woman with a penis and the police told me they cannot do anything about it because the woman with a penis told them she did not do it. The woman threatened to report the officers for being transphobic if they arrested her then they dismissed me. Now I am suicidal.,Suicidal

18307,18327,Guess should start of saying if you check my short post history I have obviously not went through with it yet. Although I have it currently planned out a lot better so I will go peacefully even if I kind of feel that would not be good for a part of the reason I want to go.Every day I am trying to further justify having no guilt wanting to kill myself. The latest reason is why do I have to emotionally suffer the death of my parents from old agehealth issues? it is really not something I want to deal with among many other aspects of life some being a part of life bullshit some my own doing yet here I am born into this with only one true choice.There is lots of mentions of killing yourself is selfish why? Surely it is just as selfish to produce a life and let it suffer at all the bullshit life has to offer? Or are people that want kids just delusional in some way? Have these people just never had any problems or just wilfully ignorant at what bringing a living thing into this world actually means? Why is producing life okay but having the choice to ending it not?,Suicidal

18344,18364,i feel like a horrible person. I am on the brink of going insane i feel like. i have a fear of being a pedophile i despise them but i keep convincing myself i am one? I am scared of this it hurts so much.it seems to get worse the worse mental state I am in when i feel normal i feel like i do not even believe it that its just in my head. this past week is has been rough and I have been thinking about it a lot. the first anniversary of my moms murder is sunday and I am not sure if they are correlated or not. i feel like maybe i can solve this problem if i could talk to someone. i have a therapist and this is a very small town and i do not trust them and there is not another one i can get realistically. my therapist is a antimasker and anti vaxxer for fucks sake.if this continues i would rather die than have to think these thoughts. i believe i have pedo OCD and its ruining my mind,Suicidal
18370,18390,I have tried to kill myself several times but I always chickened out. I am extremely worried that I have brain damage as I have tried to choke myself to death countless times and I know there is 2 big arteries on your neck and when they get pinched you get brain damage. How long do you have to apply pressure to get brain damage. I am severely concussed right now I did it on purpose to. I have applied pressure to my neck with noises belts. And I am so scarred about my head. I cannot take it anymore my brain hurts so bad will it ever get better? I cannot live like this anymore. I feel so stupid. How long does it take to get brain damage via noose. I could breathe the whole time if that helps. I never felt light headed during it. And I do not think I applied pressure for more than 1 minute. My head just is not the same anymore it hurts so bad all the time. I have horrible concussion symptoms that get worse everyday. I simply cannot live like this anymore. I have no appetite and I am constantly losing weight. I only weight 114 lbs and I am 5'10. If my brain does not get better I will be forced to kill myself. I used to be so smart now I cannot think or do anything. I want nothing but to die and I have made many suicide attempts and am worried about brain damage. I want nothing but to kill myself. But if I survive it will just get worse. I hate life so much.,Suicidal

Survivsl instincts ig I never like living,Suicidal

18382,18402,I have often passively ideated it but I feel like I am sinking more amp more into active ideation where now I really do wonder if my story will end with me dying by my own hand. A huge part of me really really wants it all to be over because I am so tired of living in the US amp being part of the system but another part really does want the story to get better. Like maybe I can leave the country amp end up doing something I love.I do not know if that is likely though. I think its super likely Id just end up sad amp alone. I do not really have family. amp all my friends have their own lives with lots of families amp other friends. amp I am so far out of the norm because I am not cis amp I am neurodivergent amp I do not even know much about falling in love because romance is a huge scary mystery to me that I just do not understand or really experience like normal ppl do. I like film studies though. amp I love helping people. amp I have had an excellent academic career so far finished undergrad. Id really love to be a professor someday amp help students the way my professors have helped me. Id like to help make education more inclusive amp accessible. But its getting harder to be a professor these days. Grad school could be a lot more affordable in other countries but I am not sure yet if there is even a film studies program out there for me that is still affordable. It might be a little bit too niche. A lot of the world is not friendly for nonbinary people. Its getting easier in some places but its still hard. It makes me wonder if there is a place for me in this world when everything is the way that it is. I have friends who care about me but even when I did reach out for help so few answered. Only one sounded really genuine. I think everyone is tired of me. amp that hurts too. I do not think Ill be ending things quite so soon but its always on my mind. I keep asking myself whether living is really worth it amp when if not will I finally initiate the final act? Sigh. I hate not knowing. I keep weighing the possible rewards of keeping my subscription to living against the relief of no longer having to pay for it. Even then I still feel like I am in a trial period except I do not know when its going to end. When should I have a decision? I wish I knew! I wish it was easier. But who does not though am I right? Oh well. I feel like I am constantly deciding whether I am going to keep my subscription to life.,Suicidal
18397,18417,I feel like I am hanging by a thread. does therapy really help?,Suicidal
18413,18433,Whenever I get triggered I get this immediate reaction to start wishing for a life without my personality issues. That often leads me to question why I have these problems and answering them with oh yeah its because of my mom who abused me to no end and kept the torture up until I was about 22. So when the feeling is strong I imagine myself taking a knife straight to my stomach in front of everyone who cannot understand my pain as a form of protest to show what this kind of upbringing can do to a person. I would never wish my pain on anyone. Trying my best to find reasons that make life worth living. Sometimes I do but even then its really sad and embarrassing to admit those things are not enough when I know I am quite lucky to have any moments at all. I do not really know why I am alive. I feel like I just wake up get triggered go to work repeat. Realized I want to kill myself to prove a point,Suicidal
18420,18440,It seems stupid to most people I am guessing but I just removed all of my piercings and flushed them down the toilet. They gave me a sense of being more feminine.I think I am going to buzz my hair again because it looks like shit anyways due to male pattern baldness. I am going to start getting rid of more of my furniture and give away some of the expensive things I bought. Maybe someone else enjoy them. I gave away my nice baking stuff already and my GoPros. I just put stuff in the hallway with a free sign and its gone. I smashed my oled tv already and my computer monitor. I need to figure out how I can get rid of the those now I do not think I can just throw it in the trash.I have a date this Saturday that I want to bail on but I am still going to go. I need to stop trying to meet people its not like I can use someone else to try to be happier anyways. I always hear that you need to love yourself first before someone else will love you anyways. I kind of hope the date goes poorly or she says she is not interested in seeing me more. That will really motivate me to take care of this problem I have.I do not think I am going to leave a note. I have written some before but there is nothing much to say.I think the nice thing about having epilepsy is that I do not have to OD on anything I can just stop taking my medication and my body will take care of the rest. Piece by piece,Suicidal
18461,18481,I cannot do this anymore. I am at my breaking point. I cannot talk about this to my family because I do not want them to worry. I cannot talk to my mother about this because I already tried. I recall my mom saying something like we are all depressed here. Those are not the words I wanted to hear. Hearing those words I felt a sharp pain in my heart. I cannot really talk about this to my father because he is a drunk. I cannot talk about this to my siblings because they mean so much to me. I cannot make them worry about me. It would break my heart. I cannot talk about this to my friends because I lost them a long time ago. I lost all my friends because I wanted to isolate myself from them. So when I did kill myself it would hurt them less. Haha I remember even telling my best friend at the time this. I hope she forgot about me and live her life peacefully without me. I have this feeling for years and it just will not shake off. I honestly wish I was not me. Thanks if you read the whole thing. I Just cannot Do This Anymore,Suicidal
18504,18524,I do not even know what to say. I just know that my heart aches extremely and the only thing that will heal me is time. I do not want to die but I cannot fucking stand feeling like this.

18510,18530,Hi everyone I was just wondering if someone could please tell me that I am worth something or anything. Pretty much all day every day I am being constantly put down and I might be just a baby but it is always some comment or someone trying to put me down. And I have nobody to lift me up but myself. My whole life I have never really had anyone close. All my friends do not really care I have never had a girlfriend to hug when I needed it and everything is just putting me down when I need something to lift me up. So please someone tell me that I am worth being alive or something positive please Hello all if nobody minds I could really use a friend right now,Suicidal
18530,18550,i know my parents will not believe me if i confessed my thoughts and even if they did it would spread like wildfire and then everybody would know. killing myself is seeming easier and easier than any other option how do i overcome the fear of asking for a therapist,Suicidal
18580,18600,I wish I could just whither away to nothjng. I have no motivation or desire to live for myself anymore. I do not have anyone else to live for either.

18600,18620,Hi I met someone online and our conversation ended up with them confessing to me. They say they have not eaten for over a week nor slept.

18668,18688,This is kind of an update to my previous post. one of my old friends ? i do not know what we are anymore says she will rethink ending things but no promises and that it might take a few weeks. I say its fine since i do not want to ruin shit even further. but i cannot handle it being alone for that long seems impossible. even two days at this point is a living hell. I have no one to talk to except a fucking subreddit its kind of funny tbh but pretty depressing. I do not know if I have the strength to wait,Suicidal

18704,18724,I know what to do. I go back and forth. I still miss you. I want to talk to you,Suicidal
18715,18735,I have never actually been actively suicidal but the thought has been there ever since my early teens when something pretty traumatic happened to me. It was sort of a back door you know? But never something I considered going through with in a near future. I did not have a plan or anything really but the thought of having a way out was comfort enough. Really the simple thought that this will not last forever it will all end some day was usually enough to keep me from feeling panicked and claustrophobic for simply being alive. And growing up I navely thought that life would just automatically get better without me actually putting in the time and effort to make it so. The prospect of becoming an unemployed depressed and washed up adult did not even occur to me. I was convinced that by this time I would either be dead or having gotten my shit together have a decent job and maybe even a steady relationship. This inbetween sad existence was something I did not expect. 13 year old me would be so disappointed. Now I am at a stage in life where I am still young but I have managed to ruin basically everything I had going for me in life. If I had put in the effort I could have gone places. But here I am borderlinealcoholic depressed used up and hating myself. Through my careless self destructive lifestyle I have gotten myself a bad reputation allowed people to take advantage of me and used and abused other people and more or less hurt myself in every way possible physically and mentally. I am scarred and damaged inside and out. I am a she will. I have gone out of my way to make sure I get to see the very worst of human kind by spending my time with others who hate themselves and life as much as I do. I have destroyed so much I do not even know if I have more to lose. I feel like a bottomless hole of hatred rage and contempt for myself and everyone else. I cannot feel happiness I cannot love. I cannot feel anything but shame regret and anger. I resent myself for allowing life to get this bad. I am not considering suicide now but part of me wishes that teenage me would have just ended things before this shitshow began so I would not have to live down this long walk of shame. I thought there would be some kind of reward or feeling of pride at this point for fighting to stay alive. But all I get is more and more shit thrown at me. It never ends. Life just deteriorates and I feel like a zombie. I wish I had killed myself when I was a teenager,Suicidal
18727,18747,Been going for about 7 months and he has told me several times now that I am beyond help. I spend every waking second wanting to die. Effectively I have nobody to talk to about it as he seems to not be interested and my parents refuse to talk about it and get mad and dismiss me when I try. I have been constantly depressed for years and my life only gets worse and worse every year so when people say that its only temporarily it gets better it just pisses me off So Psychologist says he cannot help me,Suicidal
18733,18753,I took 14 pills. Seven of them were Cetirizine generic Zyrtec and the other seven were Aleve. Am I going to die? Am I going to die? what is should I do?,Suicidal
18743,18763,I have no friends I can spend times with anymore. They are in their 20s yet their parents do not let them and I really do not even have the energy to make new friends anymore. I just keep having dark thoughts crossing my mind. Not even just that I wish I had someone I am good with to hold and be by my side. This loneliness makes it hard to even be productive. Yet just about everyone we meet asks what we do. I do nothing but fight all these things trying to kill me. I just needed to vent. I am so exhausted from this loneliness.,Suicidal
18748,18768,Cursed restrictions on rborrow ... The only community that could help me. 200 fucking dollars that might be the difference between living and dying. It just does not seem fair I did everything right I was just dealt such a shitty hand...I am a currently employed student in Croatia that will become homeless soon. I had used up the savings I had from occasional jobs on the last few months of rent and food while I was completing this semester. I have started a new student job for summer this month at Kaufland supermarket but I will not see the paycheck until second week of next month. I am completely broke until then I have been eating nothing but oats for the last week and landlord is threatening with the police because I cannot pay him this month's rent. I am desperate I have nowhere to turn banks will not give loans to someone who works sporadically as a student. I would be willing to accept a 100 interest rate with all the personal info provided and a paypal protection a winwin fucking situation and I am just not allowed to get it... Because I come from a broken family and cannot make friends... If I get kicked out of the apartment I am hanging myself.

18771,18791,As I come closer to my time to go I am going to be writing letters to my loved ones. For my parents I am going to write a letter and record two videos for them. One video will be an indepth explanation of my decision and the other will be a brief happy video for them. Happy meaning just a video where they can hear me say I love them and so they can keep hearing my voice after I have passed. I have already created them emaildrive accounts for all this to be backed up so they will not have to worry about losing the video. I have written other letters to my close friends. If you lost someone you loved what would you want from them? Goodbye LettersVideos,Suicidal
18780,18800,Obviously do not stop helping and supporting the people you know. This is not a discouragement of that entirety.it is just that way more help support advice is toxic or ultimately harmful than I see acknowledged.People intentionally or not minimizing your problems telling you that it is simply a matter of willpower or time dropping you if you need support for more than a few days I understand that support is not easy but this should be discussed or done gently not just ghosting etc. etc.... It just really shows how few people care and even less do anything about it. Sometimes people spouting advice hurts just as much as the problems,Suicidal
18786,18806,I fucking hate my mental illness and have been working so hard to try and live with this but it is getting impossible I just want to not exist anymore if this continues I will probably not last much longer I am already making plans it is unbearable I am so done,Suicidal

What will be the most peaceful way to die?,Suicidal
18920,18940,My wrists itch fingers trembling the ghosts of old scars there. Switched it up to bruising and now the pain and force feeling is missed when they start to fade. Throat fluttering and clenching for pills that are not there. Sinuses full and head woozy brain all encompassing. How is this so romanticized that I actually love and miss it.Mania will come tomorrow so I will be okay. If I just ignore the way my body feels today and accept the loneliness of being crazy but not showing a soul beyond therapists and hotlines. Romantic suicide,Suicidal
18932,18952,I should preface this with I have been on a downhill for the past few months. A few days ago while at work I was writing on a paper and basically venting about my recent issues I kind of zoned out while writing and when I reread it I realized I had wrote a suicide note. This definitely is not the first but it is the first in a long time. I am seeking mental help through therapists but the earliest they could get me in was mid August. I feel like my shift in attitude has pushed away all my friends and then because they are withdrawn from me I feel even worse and I do not want to talk to them about it because I do not want to put my burden on their shoulders. I have turned to drinking pretty much every day this past week to try and cope. I really want to make it to August but I do not know what else to do. How do I stop myself from catastrophizing and making myself think that everyone hates me? How do I stop my brain from creating all these scenarios that make me so sick and sad all the time? I feel like I have tried everything short of a 12 gauge. Need some advice,Suicidal

19250,19270,I am only 15 and I know a lot of you will say you wish you can be 15 again but I feel stuck in the same pattern of worthlessness and just being very depressed. I do not truly have anyone and do not think I ever will because of my own low self esteem and insecurities. I just want to be loved and accepted but I do not know if Ill ever truly feel happy and loved. Is it even worth it,Suicidal
19270,19290,The voices never stop mocking me telling me to hurt myself and others. I feel like I am only living for the sake of my loved ones and nothing truly matters. I have inflicted a lot of damage in the past and paid the price a thousand times over. Its just been a viscous cycle I cannot break. I have had to isolate myself for years in fear of hurting the people that used to be around me. Today I have to pay for my past actions I will have to deal with another lengthy jail sentence.

19308,19328,I wish that there was someone who would try to stop me... Someone to cut me down from my noose or call 911 when I pass out in the tub from an overdose or stop the bleeding long enough for the EMTs to start a transfusion.

19322,19342,I have fucked up my reputation where i live because of my prior drinking issues i fell out of a relationship and quit my job due to my low self esteem not allowing me to accept appreciation but simultaneously i feel like my hard work is more exploited than rewarded.My cigarette intake got worse after the pandemic i started drinking again and it seems I am not able to get a break anymore.. I am tired of this idea of slaving for decades in hopes that the stresses and habits of coping do not kill me before i can cash out my retirement the face that i have to favor someone else's interests in order to survive fucking kills me. For once in my life i just want to be selfsustaining without penalties. I want people to just fucking let me do my thing without dipping their dick beaters in my goddamn pockets. I want to explore.... but I am poor i want to better my financial situation but even furthering my education weilds a life long debt because why not keep people trying in their own pocket of financial misery.

19341,19361,Its so awkward between us right now. We used to be very close. He was the only reason I woke up. I want to talk to him about this but I do not want to burden him anymore than I already am. I feel like I am losing my best friend,Suicidal
19354,19374,what is the point of trying to make my room all nice and clean and functional when I am so depressed in it anyway life never goes any way that is planned and I have no clue what my life will look like even 6 months from now. We were supposed to be moving in together and it is so uncertain that I am struggling to suppress the urge to just say I do not want to anymore. When it is all I want.I am just so upset. I want to cut but I do not i want to die but I do not want to do it if I die I am just going to be deadnamed a lot at my funeral but I will be dead so who cares really. I do not want to do this or be here. I do not like self harming when I am upset because of her because I never want her to feel like she is the one hurting me like that. she is actually the best but I am just so upset at the situation and I do not have anything else to do. No one to cry with right now. I am just in this stupid house and i do not want to be. I hate this body i hate this existence. Why did I have to be made this way there is too much wrong with me. I had my first appt with a new therapist today and i sounded so put together today and now I am alone in the dark crying and wishing I would die and she totally has the wrong impression of me now because i am no longer okay. I just cannot ever sleep. I do not know what to do with myself every night. I am so fatigued at the time. I do not want to work i physically feel so bad. And yet i have to and i have an interview tomorrow and id rather just perish. I just do not want this body or existence. It is so painful. I have been lying to myself trying to make myself feel enjoyment or trying to feel good about things by doing my hobbies and making my room nice but nothing will ever help or mask this. Il never get out of this house. I do not want this,Suicidal
19355,19375,Id kill myself if I lived alone by now. The only thing holding me back is my family. I do not want my cousins or grandma to find my body. I think that jumping off a bridge is my best option or killing myself in a car wreck then maybe Ill be able to kill myself but then again all I need is the courage to do it. I want to kill myself but I do not want my family members to find me.,Suicidal
19374,19394,I have been losing the most important ones one by one for the past year. The person who made huge progress on my trust issues knocked me down again. I want to take the car and run myself off the road while flooring it. I think about that every day but have been telling myself everything will turn around soon but I have realized its just wishful thinking. I have noone anymore i just wanted to get it said however that is going to help me I am not even trying to hold on anymore,Suicidal
19420,19440,I sacrificed everything to achieve my dream and failed. Now I have nothing. I was happy with risking everything and knew a life outside of achieving my dream was not a life worth living to me. I have come to terms with my failure and am going to see what is on the other side. Sayonara bitches. Adios world,Suicidal
19470,19490,It does not matter whether I am feeling happy or sad in the end there is still that feeling of being lost and really hating myself.All I can think about is suicide yet I still deny the fact that I am mentally ill. I just pretend I am fine and if anything I have bad mental health. Everything is fine everyone or is it?I literally have no reason to be sad. I have a perfect partner supportive parents a lot of cool friends. I am middle class live in a great spot could easily find a good job. So what is wrong?I know it is wrong for me to say this butIt does not feel like itI despise my parents. I try my best to keep it all in because deep down I know it is not their fault.All my friends feel fake.And someone I love the most is probably losing interest in me.Honestly not surprising. It would be shocking if they did not!These things are not true but they feel like they are true. I still crave to breakdown infront of them all so they could see my pain yet I do not.It just is not their fault I am like this but if this is not their fault whose fault is it?Only me to blameNobody really likes blaming themselves do they? Even when people actively do so they still subconsciously hope it really is not because of them.See you may think it is irrational of me to blame myself. Blame myself for all the things that did not happen or are not happening blame myself for being ugly. No I understand these things are not true.it is my fault I did not seek help and I am not actively seeking help. I am actually quite against that idea. Why? I have no idea. it is like an irrational fear. Thinking about it makes me very panicky and I do not know why.SuicideSuicide is funny. what is funnier is the thought process that happens to people that decide to do it.We feel so hopeless that even the dream of living in serenity and calmness without all this meaningless emotional pain that is so incredibly needed feels so unattainable. Yet we pick the cold hands of death because we are so desperate that even the shortest path is too long for us.cannot blame them. I am on the verge of suicide too.Too tired to continue. I may be always superpositioned but I know one thing for sure I am so tired of myself,Suicidal
19471,19491,it is been some time I have been here. I have been telling lies to myself since them. That people that love and respect themselves do not kill themselves.But I was thinking about myself. I have been locked in an in and out relationships for the last nine years. I have been raped during childhood during adolescence I have been beaten and belittled by my own mother. I have no money and spend a shitload of cash on depression medication. I talk to a psychiatrist and a psychologist. And I have been thinking. I am not a bad person. I have just been fucked up by life and by trying to help others. Lately I have been giving up to alcoholism. it is the only thing that helps me study to perhaps earn money and still be dissatisfied. I do not see an exit from my situation. Depression is forever. I do not have what I want. But I do like myself. I do give value to myself. I do love myself. And so I think Why not just give up? Why not take a superdosage of insulin or hang myself or something? I do not deserve to suffer like this. And the rational way is to kill myself. So why not? I have to think of myself first. Fuck family. Fuck friends. I do like them. But I have to think of myself first. I should do it. I really should do it. there is nothing wrong with it. there is nothing wrong with choosing death. I like myself. Thus I should kill myself.,Suicidal
19490,19510,I really do not see a point anymore.I have lost almost everything in the last 2 years.I am left with no friends. My family hates me. I keep messing things up. I am so sorry for the actual one person who cares about me and loves me. But I really cannot anymore I think I do it next tuesday.,Suicidal
19506,19526,God the amount of many i would pay someone to do that is unreal. I wish someone would assassinate me so I do not have to kill myself.,Suicidal
19509,19529,My city is in flames and I am barely holding on I feel like my family are oblivious to what is going on I cannot believe my life is just getting worse and worse along with everyone else here but I am truly scared as I feel I have nothing left in me. I almost want to end it before something even more traumatizing happens. I am staying alive for my cats and the guy I love but he can easily just move on and find someone better maybe even closer to him without all this bs that I have to endure. This situation in my country makes me so sad and depressed I am putting on a brave face but I am crushed inside.. I feel like I am trapped truly trapped and there is no way out but to endure more and more. The days seems more and more bleak we have food shortages pet food shortages and soon maybe internet cut off as with water. I am devastated. I do not know anymore,Suicidal
19512,19532,i have ehlers danlos a mutation i am a glitch not a program i have so many health problems that burden others i feel like i wish i was aborted but i know there will be no afterlife because only humans have souls i know my emotions are just chemical reactions i hate the fact i am conscious despite not being human so i am aware of my own suffering caused by being an abomination of naturea glitch in evolution I am not human and i think about killing myself every day,Suicidal
19564,19584,I do not know where to start. I am stuck at a dead end hospital job. I am in a shitty relationship. I have no emotional support from my family and I have no friends. I feel like a failure. My family thinks I am a failure. I used to be a straight A student in high school and was planning on going to college. But it ended up being extremely overwhelming and I did not even complete the first year. I am also dealing with abuse. I am stuck. I cannot handle it anymore. I have been thinking about suicide for months now. Honestly the only reason why I have not done it yet is because I am a coward. I am scared it will hurt too much and scared that Ill survive it. I am at my jobs parking lot as I type this and researching ways to kill myself Struggling,Suicidal
19628,19648,I was told my depression is quite high. I gathered up courage to tell my family and it did not go well. They called me crazy and that it is the devil's doing. I just wanted comfort... Why cannot they understand that? They have not changed their attitude towards me... I feel myself getting more and more sensitive and technically anything can make me cry now. Last time I attempted taking 350 mg of Zoloft. Nothing happened. I told my mom but all she said is do not ever so it again I just want to be comforted.. I just want a hug and someone to tell me they love me... Right now I am bawling my eyes out.. And I have 19 pills of Zoloft which is 950 mg. I cannot take this anymore. I am going to take them. I wrote this bc I want someone to know how desperate I feel. Ty for reading. I just cannot take it anymore,Suicidal
19635,19655,I found my cat a good home it fucking hurts the house feels full of silence and white noise now. everything is slipping away from me I am losing my grip on reality and all of my relationships feel like they never existed One step closer,Suicidal
19661,19681,My life 1 year ago was completely different. I was such a chick magnet and everyone loved me i had so many friends and in this past year i lost everything. I have no friends so when i feel sad i do not have anyone to lean on or talk to. Being a male with depression is extremely hard bc if you speak about your feelings you are considered weak. All i want is for someone to love me even a family member but no one cares about me. It makes me feel worthless and i do not want to do this no more. I have a pistol now and every night i play with it just thinking about what would happen if i pulled the trigger. An extremely big part of me wants to die but i do not want to hurt anyone who cares about me. I have been dead inside for so long and no one seems to care but as soon as i actually die everyone will care. I seriously do not know what i did to deserve all this i do not know why I am put through this. If i could take a look into my future for 10 years and if i saw id be this way for that long i would no doubt kms. I tried a counselor but they are just someone who fake cares and they never helped me. I feel so alone and lonely it weighs me down. If only i had one friend that truly cared about me it would mean the world but no one does. What happened to me,Suicidal
19684,19704,I know that I am loved. I know that my family would do anything to keep me here with them and make me smile and that is something a lot of people do not have. I just got slammed with some kind of mystery medical issue and its drastically wearing down my will to keep going. I was fine one day and the next I was not. I cannot function day to day like I used to. I feel sick all the time. I do not know how I am going to be able to work. I have seen numerous doctors who cannot explain what is going on or offer a solution. I cannot imagine living the rest of my life feeling like I am stuck in a body that is not mine and retching into a toilet for 4 hours every morning. I am so tired of feeling sick and sad and losing the life that I had before all of this started. I sit all day and cry and imagine different ways of dying. I do not have a point to posting this other than just typing out my feelings. I just want to feel better. I am not sure how I am supposed to go on.,Suicidal
19692,19712,I was using her phone because I wanted to buy something on a random website. I saw that she was using private browsing I looked into it and here is what I saw suicide sleeping pills forum.I cannot even fully describe the feeling of dread that invaded me at this moment. I felt desperate sad angry... My mom does not have an easy life in 2019 she lost like 70 of her left feet capacity and had to undergo two back surgeries. She has to take morphine everyday to fight the pain but she is still in pain. My mom was a very active woman and the fact that she cannot run jump or even walk properly makes her really depressed. She also has financial issues because her salary is trash and she is working a dead end job that she hates. My father is not really helpful and she thinks hes not in love with her anymore my dog whom she loved dearly passed away in April and I am moving away in September. I absolutely want to leave because my mom is kind of toxic to me and I want to start a new life but at the same time I do not want to because I do not trust her anymore.My dad made a suicide attempt in 2015. Hes better now but I cannot help feeling extremely angry that both my parents wanted to die at one point. I wish they never had kids to be honest. I hate them but I do not want them to die and abandon me because I love them more than anything else in the world. I do not know what to do. I cannot even talk to her right now but I know I have to help her. But how can I help her? I know we should never make a suicidal person feel guilty or selfish because it will not help them but I am so mad at her. I am only 17 and even though Ill be an adult soon I am way too young to deal with this. And I am just plain tired. This year has been hell to me I was depressed and was dealing with an eating disorder my dog died... why cannot everything be fine? Am I not enough for my parents? I do everything I can to help my mom but it seems to be pointless. I do not know what to do to make her happy. I tried everything I could. I am her daughter and I cannot even make her slightly happy. Sometimes I feel useless. I do not think my parents love me that much now. I do not know what I have done to deserve this. I am miserable and life is just so unfair Its about my mom,Suicidal
19705,19725,I have been doing worse and worse these last few weeks.I thought I needed a break from the people and things who stressed me out but it just completely isolated me and now the mere thought of talking to anyone disgusts me to no end even more than it did before.I am autistic. I have depression and generalized anxiety disorder. As you can imagine it makes me an absolutely lovely person to be around and I am really tired of feeling like a burden of being an inconvenience of failing every social interaction.It exhausts me that I cannot stay on top of ANYTHING I always get submerged by stuff to do and think about in one aspect of my life or all at once. Social life self care health work education housekeeping it is all just too much. I feel like I am perpetually drowning. Even if I try to take a break my stupid brain does not get the concept of a break and it will just throw terrible thoughts at me every second of every single day and night.I have not cooked for myself in weeks. I guess I accidentally became a raw vegan since I have been living off of bell peppers lettuce and tomatoes. I have vaguely looked at the pile of dishes this morning. The shower needs a good scrubbing but I can barely manage to wash my own body.I have had suicidal ideas for over 10 years now and I still have no clue how to manage them no matter how many low points I have been able to somehow escape. I have tried the usual oh there is still so much to do and see but I feel like I have reached the end of this. Why would I bother going to amazing places and doing fun and exciting stuff when I cannot appreciate anything? there is beauty all around me yet I can see hear touch or taste none of it.I have always been able to survive every one of these rock bottom moments as you can see. Thing is what even is the point of realizing you have not actually reached the end of your rope if you know you are going to have a few daysweeks of feeling okay and then you will have to start all over again over and over until one day these thoughts win?And yes I have tried yoga exercise meditation clean eating therapy. I am afraid to get back on meds because if they do not work then there will truly be no hope of ever ever getting better.I just end up staring at the ceiling for hours on end. Wondering probably. I have no idea what I am even thinking of because as soon as a thought is half over it is gone. I am wasting my life and I do not care. I simply do not want it anymore. I wish I could give all the years I might have left to someone who would enjoy them.I feel so ungrateful. I do not have the best of physical health but it would be way worse. I have a beautiful apartment a job that I love cats that I adore. I have a bit of family that I can do with I even have friends who are there for me. I feel like all of these people would be better off without me. I feel like offing myself would be an act of love it would lift this weight right off of their lives.The reason I am still here is that I have my 2 cats. They are the absolute light of my life and I would do anything for them. Including staying alive. there is no one who could adopt them and care for them properly so here I am. I was born with the goal to be useful to someone and I will apparently stay alive for the exact same reason.I wish you all a better evening than mine.Be gentle with yourselves. we are fragile creatures. I am just tired,Suicidal
19709,19729,Why does not my family care? Why did not they rally around me when my world collapsed and I was breaking down? They do not even ring and check in on me and their only niece. They do not support or encourage me. How can I even call them family? Honestly I feel betrayed. Cast aside. Ignored. Why did I have to be me? To be abandoned and betrayed by anyone I trusted? I truly wish for a fatal accident or terminal illness to take me out. I would rejoice that soon this suffering and pain would end. I wish I could give all my years to my daughter and erase myself from her memory so she would never feel pain over me not being around.I hate this existence. I hate the way I am. I hate myself more than mere words can describe. Death will never come soon enough for me. I hope it does though very soon. Why...,Suicidal
19716,19736,I just wanted to tell someone because it has been slowly eating me alive. I hate that every other thought is hey why are we here? No one is going to miss you. let us just jump out this window.I feel so alone and I have no one to talk to about these feelings. let us be real even if I did it will not end well. I will still be passively suicidal just guilty for thinking about it. Ahh maybe I am just bad at this whole life thing. Fuck being casually suicidal,Suicidal
19729,19749,seriously every day I am getting worse. I have never felt this bad before. i want to die. its all i can think about.this is not long because i do not have anything else to say. but this is the worst I have ever felt. why does nobody care enough to just ask if I am okay? why does everybody come to me to rant to them? why does this happen? I am at rock bottom,Suicidal
19736,19756,Guys I am struggling fuck Struggling,Suicidal
19739,19759,i just finished my last therapy appointment with this therapist. and all i get told is to read a fucking self help book and that maybe i should look into SSRIs. all i wanted was more frequency but unfortunately she was not able to do that. I cannot tell them i do not want to be alive because that i will be 5150 but if i do not then I am not a priority to be transferred. i cannot be tested for ADHD since i am diagnosed with depression. i feel like I am fucking so stupid. my rooms a complete mess I am 21 with no sense of direction in life. and now this therapist is going to add trauma related ptsd to my fucking diagnostics. I am on super strict academic probation due failing so many classes i have one more chance to not lose my FAFSA and if i do i will have to drop out. i work in a fucking dead end retail job. what is the fucking point of all of this. my family and friends are great why cannot i be? i love them but i do not know if it enough. i feel like i am wasting time. maybe i should end it now so my family can just grieve and get over me already. Finished my last therapy appointment,Suicidal
19755,19775,First of all why do we live? For like having a good time? I do not think that is the point. All the evolution which made today's circumstances does not look like to point it. It is so obvious for me after spending my whole life just thinking about stuff it is all about picking side. Sides of this war between life and death are pretty obvious yet so hard to see. Either you choose life and fight with the problems that other side put in your life or accept the loose and side with them. Everyone I know think that they are in the life's side. Little they know it is been so long that they bowed their head to death. Everyone is painting the truth with their lies along with their desires. They just do not want to loose to death so they let the scummers do their job. The world built by human is literally built for the people have power to keep and raise it. Majority of others is ok with it because their only hope is to be in or getting close to those positions. Than what? What would they do if they reach to thier dreams? Sadly same... They are just fillers who accetped their exintance in that way. No different than any material in the world. Even their behaviour has no freedom to choose other. It is like we all at a cliff and all we can think about is to use others to make us a safe zone. Why we do that if there is an obvious cliff that screams nothing from below. We all serve to nothingness while we think we are doing our best to aviod it. So I want to ask again why do we live? If I will face with nothingness what does matter about what I do in my life time? What makes something right or wrong? Adding values on it? Because no matter how you live deeply your life every value made by us destroyed same way. But before that I have to explain what I mean by fight between life and death. Life comes from nothing and makes something. Death comes from something and makes nothing. When life try to find ways for not being reachable for death death tries to find a way to stop life's movement. Like a heart rate it kept the universe this way to us today. Every decisions we make comes from one of them. It is so heartbroken to see everyone choosing death's side. Because creating is hard work if you going to do hard work it is better to do what is obvious and served so everyone falls to the net of the death which is hanging on the cliff. They think it is safe and they covered but little they know its all part of the plan to ending our existince. I am not delusional neither consiparcy person it is what is going to happen in the long run as far it seems ... What is a valueable? Is it money? Is it water? Obviusly whatever we need has a value. The value can change along with the circumstances. For example life. Life is most valuable thing we have right? I guess not. Because it is only valuable if it means something to someone else. Otherwise no one cares. It can be person who loves you or can be person who wants to use you. Rather than those it only has value for you if you think it is valuable. So here is the question does your life valuable for you? It is simply a potential source. You could use it to have things but that is just a possibility. Most of the time people pass before they satisfied with their gains in exchange with their life's. This is why most of the people who wants to suicide because they do not want to be other side of the fight neither to see that they are loosing. I am having the same problem why do I live if I am going to end up with nothingness with all those pain only gain is here to have less pain? It is pretty logical to me but really hard to decide. What is the real problem than? Is it everyone choosing the winning side or is it that there is no hope for the other side? This makes me depressed because I am pretty sure that nothing could beat an honest mind. If the life is able to come from nothingness than nothing can defeat it. Death is just there to us for improvement not to make us giving up. We could colonize whole universe and that could be just a freaking beggining. We could choose to be anything yet we choose to be worst. I have no power to change it all I wish I could live my life by chasing my dreams. Sadly it is not allowed and I am exhausted. I had so much energy so much willpower but they all been sucked by monsters to place me next to other billions of lost existances. Hope you find a way to fight with it it seems I will not be able to hold on in close future. I have questions,Suicidal
19770,19790,Everything in this world seems so sad and meaningless. I am extremely pessimistic about my future and everything really and it seems like its all going downhill from this point. I also said my final goodbyes to 2 of my closestonly friends and that was not pleasant really.posted about it yesterday I want to jump off a bridge this week,Suicidal
19778,19798,Not much to say procrastinated 3 years since 14 so I would not get far in life. Maybe my brain knew the suffering ahead would not be worth it. Failing at everything letting everyone misunderstand what I do just not caring anymore. do not bother with the links and numbers. Farewell Earth it is the end of my days.,Suicidal
19843,19863,Long story short my family acts like anything I say in front in front of my brother is automatically offensive just because I am cis white male. He cries wolf anytime I disagree with him and I already know that society sees being white and male as evil by default. what is the point of living if I am just going to be blamed for mistakes made by some other white guy who already died decades ago. Apparently I am homophobic for being straight. I am racist for being born white. I just I do not want to be treated like a bigot for no reason. I am married and have kids and I do not want to hurt them but clearly it is best if I just die so my brother can feel better about himself. I should just kill myself to make my gay brother happy about himself.,Suicidal
19853,19873,Life became unbearable. I mean it was never good but I managed to deal with my problems and unhappiness. But since the pandemic started things became impossible. All the problems got like 100x worse. Financial ones were the worst. there is nothing worse in life than being broke. I cannot be happy living like this. I was born without asking yet I am supposed to live a life deprived from the things I want. I am pretty sure life could be awesome but without money its just impossible. It brought lots of other problems for my life. I wake up every day wishing I did not. Hopefully death comes as soon as possible and I hope to never be back to this life again. Unless I come back as a wealthy guy from an even wealthier family. Waking up every day is my biggest challenge cuz I wish I was dead.,Suicidal
19862,19882,My main plan to kill myself is sleeping pills and carbon monoxide. that is not very accessible for me so I thought it was a good plan in the sense that I am not likely to do it.But my thoughts have been getting worse. I remember a friend telling me they found an OTC cocktail on the internet. I am going to try to find that recipe and create a plan b because honestly I cannot do this shit anymore. Plan B,Suicidal
19868,19888,I took a new job against gut feeling. I am ready to die now. I am at the point where I want to kill myself and I feel at peace.,Suicidal
19869,19889,I am the battered liferaft everyone else seems to be clinging to...and I am sinking.I am fucking done. Lost on the open sea of nightmares...,Suicidal
19879,19899,please someone who lives in argentina or some nearby country could help me find a job in your country? it is nothing straight away but i would like to start now so i could go later this year. I beg you I need to get out of this place. i have a dog that has no one else and i cannot kill and leave him alone. I am asking for help just to find a job so i can stay alive a little longer I beg you I need to get out of this place. i have a dog that has no one else and i cannot kill and leave him alone.,Suicidal
19880,19900,I hate it sm. I just want to end it. Nobody would give a fuck anyways. I already know where to get the stuff I need. All I need is the fear to end. And once the fear is gone I will be gone too. I hate how afraid of suicide I am,Suicidal
19919,19939,I am not really depressed but lately I have been seriously contemplating suicide.Though I am not depressed my life is pretty shitty. i have no friends a toxic family were borderline poor ect. i have no joy in life. i have no motivation.I have nothing to look forward to. i have no dreams or aspirations I am not good at anything i have no idea what i want to do in life. I am too awkward to get anything done or get a relationship i simply cannot picture a future where I am happy.So with the combination of a shitty life now and likely an even shittier life in the future wtf is the point. i have nothing and no one i used to be so optimistic but now that me is nowhere to be found i genuinely do not think ill make it through the summer. i have a plan and the equipment only reason I am still here is because my parents do not know shit about taking care of a dog wtf is the point,Suicidal
19941,19961,Its been this way for three... fucking... years... I have not seen anyone outside of school work or my family because my plans keep falling apart because of BULLSHIT EXCUSES... every single fucking time. Why is it like this? Am I just astronomically unlucky? Every time I get my hopes up... I am finally going to see someone and get to talk to them! Then the day comes and turns out they made other plans. Or some other bs. Its always the same I do not know why I ever expect anything different. I am nothing but a pest that will not go away to these people. I just want to cut myself open and die like the disgusting cockroach that I am. Why do my plans keep falling through?,Suicidal
19943,19963,Got home from the vet and she has problems with her heart and kidneys. Meds might help and give more time but she will not be back to normal. I do not know what to do she is the only reason I am here now and the only thing I have not lost yet. When she is gone I will have nothing. I will not be able to take being home completely by myself. This was all a miserable experience it will soon finally be over. My cat is dying,Suicidal
19962,19982,If you are here Mark know that I am a few days from spending two weeks with you and then planning to end everything.You do not know this. You will not know this. This will crush you. It will crush my family. My son. But you all need to know that I cannot live anymore. I cannot cope. You offered me so much support. But I always knew that I would do this.I have told you to look at this on my phone. you will see all of my posts. And all of my comments to others where I offer them support. And yet I am not accepting it myself.It will not hurt me for long. I will go thinking of you all. It does not take long. that is a fact that I will be telling you when I see you. Because I learnt how long it is today. I will be telling you an interesting fact but to me it will become my reality.I love you. I have hurt you so much. And you were right to feel hurt. You need to know that is not what drove me to this. Because you are one of the reasons I held on for so long.I will leave you more than just this. I will leave you my son and my parents so much more than this.But you need to be here and you need to see how trapped I am in my own head. Mark read this,Suicidal
19973,19993,I have always struggled with my mental health. I have severe severe anxiety and paranoia probably sprung from a decade of drug and alcohol abuse in my 20s. I was doing so well since I knocked the drugs on the head at 29. But my paranoia has never disappeared. I am in a relationship with an incredible woman but I have started slipping back into drug abuse again and I feel like I am being gaslighted and I am unsure how to separate reality from fiction. That makes my innate paranoia a thousand times worse. I have no real way of coping with my paranoia soI dive back into smashing the booze and the booze almost always always leads to drugs which has lead me to being suicidal again. Its just easier not to have to think. I feel like a complete and utter burden to every single person I have in my life I am fucking rubbish no one should have to deal with my issues because I cannot keep my shit together. I feel like I have no worth like I cannot get anything right in the world at all I am a constant train wreck I simply cannot function with my thoughts. I have reached out desperately for help yesterday and today and have been met with little to no support or understanding from my family and friends. The crux does seem to be the gaslighting. It is really really really killing me and I need to know how to just drop the thoughts that things do not add up and simply trust her. I have been told by the family I have reached out to that I am selfish for seriously considering fucking hanging myself but how is it selfish to not want to live in constant unending mental anguish and torment. I do not know what to do. I do not know what I need to feel better. I do not know how I can cope with all the thoughts swirling around in my mind or even remotely where to start. Its going to be much simpler to kill myself because I absolutely cannot deal with this shit. I am an awful fucking human being and the world would be better off without me. I cannot keep on rallying. It gets harder and harder the olde I get. Yesterday was my 33rd birthday and I have not wanted to kill myself as much as I did yesterday morning and today.,Suicidal
19978,19998,I have suspected I had ADHD since I was around 11 or 12. Never spoke up just tried to live with it. Self harmed during middle and high school before tapering off during college. Finally saw a psychiatrist and got diagnosed at 25. Meds help a little but my skills are terribly broken. I struggle with everything from time management object permanence impulse control planning. My daily struggle is spent procrastinating on taking my meds being productive for a few hours starving myself because I cannot find the will power to get up and cook when I am hungry beating myself up mentally for wasting a whole day again and promising myself that the next day wikl be better. Eating is a chore because I hate sitting down to plan but grocery shopping without a plan is tough and deciding what to cook on a whim every single day from my limited and random ingredients is a chore. And that is before I mention that I have no dishwasher so dishes are constantly piling up. I do not think I am depressed. I would love to give life a chance. I would love to find the right meds and therapy that helps me live up to my potential. I know it is possible because I have many friends with ADHD who have gotten their symptoms tamed enough that they are all living productive and meaningful lives. Yet I feel so behind because they all got diagnosed in grade school and have at least a decade of treatment that I do not. I do not feel like I can wait 10 years. I am impatient. I want results now. I have struggled for so long that I cannot accept the fact that I have to keep struggling even though I am in treatment. I know I should just put up with the pain I am in and trudge through my difficulties but I keep seeing suicide as a get well quick scheme. I know it is not a great idea and I really do not want to cut my life short but I also hate having to struggle every single day of my existence. I have never known a day of peace so I keep thinking about how nice it would be if I never had to deal with ADHD again. I wish I had more options beyond living the struggle or giving up the fight. ADHD makes my life unbearable,Suicidal
19983,20003,I want to kill myself without anyone knowing like if I could run away and somehow obtain and ingest KCN is there an easy way of getting it? that would solve everything. I do not want to exist anymore I just want to become nothingness and not aware anymore or erase myself from everyone is memories and delete myself from occupying space in the past and present like fuck the meaning of life or nothing matters I do not care if there is significance or insignificance in this universe it is all anthropocentric anyways. I just do not want to be here at all. I do not want to exist anymore that is it. I just wish I had a choice to exist or to not exist before perceiving reality. .,Suicidal
20030,20050,I have been feeling like this since the beginning of my senior year of high school. I thought I was just going through a slump because of the pandemic and all because I have never felt such hopelessness before in my entire life but I have now graduated and I feel the same.I live with my mom and her husband along with my two baby sisters. I feel like such an insignificant part of the family I do not work the thought of interacting with people I do not know makes me sick to my stomach I cannot even leave my house to take out the trash because I feel like all eyes are on me. I rejected the only fast food job interview I was given because the idea of being around others all by myself in such an unfamiliar place made me panic and I do not do anything around the house. My mom has expressed how disappointed she is with me because all I do is lay in bed and sleep till 5 pm but I wish I could tell her it is because I do not want to be here anymore. I wish I could tell her that my days seem to blend into each other now and that every day spent alive makes me want to scream into my pillow because that just means I am not dead yet.I have tried and failed to kill myself four times already. I feel like such an attention whore for doing so even though nobody knows I have attempted. I fantasize about death constantly.Everything is a chore because doing things requires energy and I just do not have any energy left in me. It takes weeks for me to shower because the process is so time consuming I never do my laundry because I do not want to go searching for my dirty clothes I never clean my room because it is a task too daunting. Consequently I live in a pile of filth and I am probably a walking pile of filth too because everything requires effort and I have absolutely none to give.Whenever my mom tells me to clean the house it takes me so long because I always start zoning out thinking about suicide thinking about how different my life would be if I had been born into a different family or in a different country or as the opposite sex. I make up scenarios in my head to make myself feel better but just end up feeling worse than before because I am fantasizing about the unachievable.I feel so hopeless. The worst part is I really want help. I do not want to feel like this anymore. I do not want to wake up every day and start to cry because I am still here but I feel like I am probably just exaggerating. What if this is just a phase? My mom thinks nothing is wrong with me she is convinced I am just lazy and unmotivated and maybe she is right. She makes me feel like I am such a disappointment but I cannot even blame her because well I am. But she knows nothing about how I feel only bases her judgement on what she sees and to her I am just her daughter who has no future ahead of her who is useless and cannot fend for herself and who will never amount to anything in life. She does not know I want to die. She does not know I spend every waking second thinking about how nice it would be if I could just stop existing. She does not know anything but I wish she did.I do not know what to do. I am so tired of this life. I think about killing myself nearly every day. I am so tired of being here.,Suicidal
20057,20077,Hi. Hope you are all having a good night. I am just tired. Really tired. I have got mental health that is been degenerating for the best of a year. Even with meds I cannot keep episodes down. I am paranoid my gf is talking to someone else even though there is no basis and i cannot get it out of my head. It is not fair to her so I will best be moving on to the next life world whatever. Even if its just a big sleep with no afterlife I would be okay with that. I am separate from her. She lives in Prenont and I in Houston. she is the most wonderful girl I have met. she is grown so much from the person she was and I am proud of her. Me on the other hand am just getting tired of lifes hardships. I lost two best friends because one of them was unhinged. I knew they were not my friend at that point when she went off on me for trivial reasons but it still hurt coming from a best friend. I have nothing positive to offer her and I can tell she is getting tired of being patient for me. Just a massive combination of things that all oule up that make this all feel like it is not worth it. I did not ask to be born into this life.there is nothing anyone can do to change my mind. I have a plan I have access as a means. Finishing my social work masters exam in a few days will be my last accomplishment. Pass or fail I am going to drive out somewhere take my favorite snacks smoke a final few bowls and let the carbon monoxide take me . Painful or not I just want to sleep. Might end it after my licensure exam,Suicidal
20066,20086,So I was going pretty good for a while I had a pretty stableish job with a partner I loved started working on my credit score to hopefully get surgeries or a house or whatever else. I had about 4k saved up in my bank that I saved from scratch alone as I would been unemployed for quite a while beforehand and rapidly needed to save money. Life was good or seemingly so my gf had always wanted to move to Oregon and seeing as how I had the money and a job that could be transferred over and she is literally my gf who is moving so I got to come with lmfao I took it. I got here with no house I lived in a hostel for about a month which was miserable and afterwards met this pretty cool dude who gave me a place to stay. Unfortunately the system failed him too and he is being deported back to India meaning for me I now have no money and no house and no gf and no stability. Everything I have scraped by to make my own to chisel out of the fucking marble rock that is my life has just as quickly collapsed around me and I am left to pick up the pieces. I am about to be homeless penniless nameless and overall worthless to anyone around me save my body. Hey hey me again,Suicidal

20101,20121,My online boyfriend has been the only reason I have been keeping going through all the bullshit. Because I really want to meet him in person. I want to achieve my biggest dream of dating someone I really like before I kill myself. I will spend a great time with my favorite person in the world and kill me.I cannot wait to meet him and I cannot wait to die. 2021 has been shit. I cannot take it anymore. I want to end the pain as soon as possible. I will commit suicide after I meet my online boyfriend in person,Suicidal
20131,20151,My relationship was the only thing I had going for me and turns out my girlfriend is an extremely dangerous and manipulative person who can amp will turn any fight into me being crazy because well I am crazy. Now any emotion I feel is crazy. I quit my job because everyday I was thinking about killing myself. I have been getting really really close to taking my life there are times I will probably never tell anyone because it hurts to much to process the pain of how close I have come to taking my own life. I want to die so fucking bad. I am tooo fucking innocent and pure for how dirty this world had done me. For the people who have hurt me. I want to fucking die. I need to fucking die. I am worthlesssssssssssssssssssss fucking killl me what is the point,Suicidal

20182,20202,This has never happened to me before. I have always looked at a positive outcome to my future but all I see is death now. Trapped in a never ending cycle of emotional abuse I am a 22 year old lady who lives with my mom who cannot even talk to anyone. It has prevented me from getting a job. Always daydreaming and drawing like a child in my apartment. Health issues that make me want to starve at this point. I do not want to live anymore. Too emotional and confused to type anything else. I am so sorry. I am trying to think positive but its suicide.,Suicidal
20198,20218,I feel really stuck. It just feels like there are just so many things going on even though nothing's actually going on. Currently I am a high schooler and I live with my extremely homophobic parents who I have yet not come out to and they are the main sources of my suicidal thoughts. My mother is also abusive and hits or berates me whenever I do something even slightly wrong which causes a lot of anxiety for me when I mess something up. But even without their influence I can only manage to think about how much I am failing and lagging behind everybody else and that I am worthless. And when I try to take one small step at a time trying to finish anything I get easily distracted and end up not finishing even after hours have gone by. I have not been sleeping or eating at all. Suicide feels like the only option left but I want to hold on for those around me who love me but I do not know how long i can last feeling this low. I am stuck.,Suicidal
20220,20240,Really what is the point of life? I keep being in a rollercoaster of sadness joy anger and i just keep hurting the people around me.

Its not selfish I am just tired of suffering every single day. what is the point?,Suicidal
20227,20247,I turn 25 in 2 weeks. I wish I could say I lived a good life. It was not a good life. I am not a good person. Id give anything to start over but I cannot.

I think this is it.,Suicidal

20242,20262,For those who have been there is it possible for you to communicate through text what being suicidal feels like? I am sure this is incredibly difficult to relive and if this is to ridiculous of a request I will delete this post immediately. But I had a colleague commit suicide and he wrote a very clear and concise letter on Facebook that made me feel like this was his only option. He had tried everything from books to professionals he made it seem like that this option was best for him? In his letter he almost had me convinced that in this course of action he would finally be at peace. Like the title says help me understand. Help me understand.,Suicidal

20330,20350,I think I might have died in a car accident or something. Either that or I am in a coma somehow. Because what kind of world could because so much suffering? It feels like I do not exist. Not that I even want to I wish I did not. I just want to know what is real. If I am real if I actually exist. I may sound psychotic saying this but I truthfully do not know anymore. If I am dead and this is in fact Hell or Purgatory then so be it. I do not care. I do not know if I am real anymore.,Suicidal
20336,20356,Since the pandemic began Im17 moved to another citytemporarily then another oneagain temporarily and traveled between these two towns back and forth for almost a year. In this time period I have rarely been in the city Awith all my friends classmates etc. and pretty much was on my own for a year. At first I thought I dealt with this isolation just fine. I am introverted after all and I just relaxed and enjoyed the peace. But after a year since the pandemic has began the solitude began to take its toll. I have felt lonely. Which eventually led me to being depressed. In the beginning of summer I was finally able to come to the city A and meet my two closestand perhaps only friends. I have been here for nine days then went to another city for two weeks and came back here for another two weeks.The social interactions with my peers which I have craved so much and have finally gotten made me happy but not for long. At some points they did not even distract me and I was as miserable around my friends as if I was by myself.I realized sometime before that nothing makes me truly happy. I have been extremely pessimistic about my future and everything really. Soon Ill go to college and the boring sad and dull adult life might begin.Anyway for quite some time I have been venting about all of this to my closest friend. Today may have been the last time I saw her before our fivetenyear class reunions. we have decided to hang outmy 2nd closest friend but it turnt out not that great.Not only did I saw more proof that she does not really care about mesmth I realized not so long ago but also she was cold. Most importantly during our final goodbyes she told me it was hard to be friends with me because of the negativity and pessimism I bring. Yeah I was already sad but that just made it worse. I am a burden and I knew that but I did not expect her to say smth like that. Totally understand and don blame her at all. My closest friend told me that it is really hard being my friend because of all the negativity that i radiate. That might have been the last time I saw her.,Suicidal
20377,20397,I wrote a bunch of stuff but it does not matter and nobody else needs to read it. Just knowing somebody will see this and know that I am a person and I exist makes me feel a little better. Vivid ideas that I cannot stop,Suicidal

20465,20485,Its been awhile since I posted here. Years. I have been having some wild highs since then and occasional lows. I got to a point where I prided myself for the fact that suicide was no longer an option. This year has been insanely rough though. A lot of fucked up things have happened. For a moment I felt like I have finally found a way to maintain myself. Financially mentally and physically. I was very healthy exercising and on top of my obligations. The pandemic slowly stripped away a lot of that as I was forced to find a new routine and new work. Met with the same endless cycle I once was.I started getting known through the online gaming through a friend who is found success there. I kind of threw myself into these communities as I was feeling lost and it felt as if they gave me support and laughs. Fast forward a bit and I end up streaming myself with a lot of support off the bat.Its been about 5 months now and I find myself with a very active community who is very loving and supportive of not just myself but all of us. I could not be more proud. My friends are the best. However as someone who is suffered with depression and suicidal tendencies most of my life I have been feeling quite a lot of pressure to maintain this community. I have been lucky enough to make a living off of it nothing astronomical but enough to have the freedom of working for myself which I prioritized as a means to continue growing. Even if I am struggling.The last couple months have been exceptionally difficult though. I have began drinking heavily at times I mean 5 days a week. I told my moderators about this and explained to them why my schedule has been inconsistent they responded with love and support and I promised them Id correct it and prioritize what we have built. Its been about 5 days since then I have not drank at all but I have been feeling mega depressed. Suicidal thoughts keep popping up and I am feeling exhausted all the time. I could not imagine the impact something like that would because not in just my community but the platform itself. I feel very selfish. But no one knows the true extent of what I have went through and why Id want to do this. I do not want to hurt anyone but I have been truly debating driving my car off one of the beautiful cliffs and moving on. Suicidal thoughts while having having nothing but love and support from my online community,Suicidal

I have told my parents for years that if guns are on the property to please not tell me. i think he assumed my suicidal tendencies were gone but funny enough they are actually stronger than they have ever been. my life is an absolute waste. i have no skills happiness will to keep trying whatever I am not going to list anything else. my life is pathetic. spending almost a decade chasing a man who loves me but not nearly as much as i do him many failed relationships in between with a lot of abuse. my parents are constantly upset with me because of my depression and i truthfully have no desire to fix myself. what is the point honestly if I am always going to feel this way? never going to feel good enough? i used to sit by train tracks and wait for the trains to come. when i thought i was for sure going to die i was at peace. true peace. i want this nightmare to end. i will find my peace. i know how I am going to do it only a matter of finding the keys,Suicidal

20664,20684,There is absolutely nothing I can do to live a happy life. I need help with everything and it is just at a point where I am tired. I have told my people in my family that I am probably going to kill myself and they just shrug it off and say do not say that. I love my parents so much. I feel like such a burden and if I die I will just be helping them. Why was I born?.. what cruel fucking joke is this?I am at the stage where I am not fucking bluffing about it anymore I am just planning how and where and when.it is been this way for about 4 years... 4 years of constant thoughts of offing myself I am honestly surprised I did not do it earlier. 16yr old male with Dyspraxia dyscalculia dysgraphia adhd and possible asd and agoraphobia.

20670,20690,When you feel depressed or know that you are you cannot help it. You cannot help yourself from feeling a certain way. It changes the way you think the way you act. When you are depressed people do not usually treat you with much compassion or understanding. They do however become sympathetic when you die by suicide. that is how it is. Once you take your life people start to post your photos with captioned stories of how amazing you were when you were alive and how much they will miss you. The sad truth is the same people who do this are the same people who saw you at your lowest and ignored it. I have been having a difficult time to feel constant happiness. I have been having suicide thoughts for a long time. I just do not want to live anymore. There are times that I have tried but to be honest during the times that I tried I guess I always knew that it was not going to kill me I guess it was a call for help? But what if it actually does kill me. What if I went to far and actually end up dying.. Its not even the fact that I could die that scares my but what does is not knowing what happens after. What happens after I die? do I really go to hell for killing myself? Will i just be a ghost roaming around earth? Will I have another life? Will nothing happen and Ill just cease to exist? What if nobody cares that I am gone? What if things will get better one day and I would not know since I killed myself? At this point I do not think its a question of whether or not ill kill myself but rather its a question of when I am going to kill myself. I know that things eventually get better but fucking shit its taking a hella long time. Thoughts,Suicidal
20672,20692,its alright its never going to happen. they do not ever think about you in the first place. you hopeless dumbass. I am so cowardly i wish the person i love would just fucking slit my throat because i cannot do it myself,Suicidal
20676,20696,this is the 4th silent breakdown i got from the span of 5 hours. I tried to dismiss the pang in my throat bc i did not want my family to notice I am on the verge of crying. I may have joked a lot of times about being the first one to die. Idk maybe i am an asshole for being interested in my family's reaction once they see me in my deathbed. I do not know my mental state since I am not financially independent to go secretly get myself a shrink so here i am in suicide watch writing this post. I have been feeling depressed for the last 5 years i suddenly get upset and have this pain in my throat that really hurts. I tried opening up to my parents that my tendencies of suicidal ideation had tremendously increased especially this year. But unfortunately they are the type that does not believe in such illnesses and only brand them as made up stuffs for people that are seeking attention. I tried to open up but in return they just said I am copying my bestfriend my bestfriend was diagnosed with major depressive disorder along with BPD and i easily let the demons fester inside of me bc i do not go to church that much anymore. Maybe they do have a point but I am still uncertain i cannot go selfdiagnose since I am not a professional and maybe I am also overreacting. But there are times where i really want to end it right there and there but I am too much of a coward to hurt myself so rather i tend to distract myself by either researching on painless death or just indulge in fictional literatures. Maybe i do not want to die maybe i just want to disappear for a while because everything suddenly feels overwhelming and it is exhausting and hurting at the same time. I want to open up to my friend but i do not want to bother them knowing they have their scars too maybe even deeper than mine. I have been trying to distract myself it is what I have been doing for the past 5 years. During the first year i just sleep it all off whenever i notice these dangerous thoughts randomly popping up but then suddenly they became more enticing? more louder. the fact that i cannot sleep so in return i tried to find a new way which is indulging myself into the fictional world. But now it seems it keeps getting worse the more i try to ignore them maybe 5 years is my limit. I managed to keep my wrist clean but now I have been trying to slice it although the minute i notice I am doing it i immediately back off Whenever my parents nag about my slothful behavior i keep getting reminded of the awful threats I have thrown to them making me feel guilty and even feel more like a piece of shit. When they told me I am just copying my mentally ill bestfriend just to garner attention it felt like they pushed a button. I spouted nonsense angrily and even threatened them that I would really kill myself. And then it felt like they were mocking me knowing those were just empty words and i do not have the courage to do it. In addition they also guilt trip me that i will not be able to spend my time in heaven with them since I will be rotting in hell. Because of that the thoughts of killing myself just to tell them see ma pa i could do it multiplied. I feel guilty for thinking this way because despite them being ignorant about mental health they never lacked in other aspects. I know they care a lot about me in their own ways that is they were always trying to provide me mh needs. The audacity i have to tell them such hurtful words adds up to the guilt that has been keeping me up at night. Maybe I am just being a brat. Idk I am just really tired i want to start all over again. I have been thinking of killing myself on the 6th of september. i probably back out again knowing I am a coward. Maybe that is a good thing i do not even have the courage to slit my wrist. maybe i really am just an attention seeker but if there is one thing i know i know my feelings are true and not certainly made up. this is so messy and my grammar is terrible but thanks for letting me post this mindlessly typing until my throat does not hurt anymore,Suicidal
20707,20727,For context due to trauma and mental illness I have been unable to work for about six months.I am these six months I have found society really does not give a fuck about your mental stability and comfort if you cannot work. Care is difficult to access you are constantly at risk of homelessness it is difficult to get on disability and you are discouraged to even do so for the fact the SSI system is clearly broken and pays so little.Every single thing I have used to bring myself comfort costs more money than I can currently comprehend having as I am facing years of therapy and little to no income.A non shattered phone screen from a phone I repeatedly drop due to anxiety shakes and dissociative episodes? cannot afford it.Open up your laptop to write up some of your thoughts just go get them out? Your Microsoft office subscription has expired because everything needs to be a continuing revenue stream to milk you dry.Want to watch Netflix? YouTube without ads that remind you about what you cannot afford and send you into a spiral? New shoes because you have one pair and it is been falling apart for the past year? Reup to your laser hair removal so you can look at yourself in the mirror crying. A new pair of underwear because you are somehow down to just three? Everything is too fucking expensive. And when you literally are taking no money in and facing not taking any money in for the foreseeable future every single purchase seems like too much. Some days I do not eat because my bank account is too low and I cannot stand thinking about how it is going to feel when I am really hungry.TLDR Money makes me anxious. Finances make me anxious. I want to fucking blow my brains out so I do not have to obsess over how fucking poor I am. Every time I see a news article about how rich Bezos is I want to puke. I just want to not cry about money while I am getting treatment. Everything has to cost money and everything keeps costing money.,Suicidal
20711,20731,... But people on social media give me hope and reason to stay alive as thin as that might be... What do I do? I really want to kill myself...,Suicidal
20725,20745,I cannot stand suffering anymore. I hate living so much. I swear I tried and tried after some failed attempts and some giving up. I am just tired of everything. I will get anything something to poison myself bleach rat poison you name it and mix with juice I wish I could swallow cyanide or shoot myself. I just suffer everyday and I cannot fake that I do not suffer anymore. Sorry for everyone who I ruined lives and that is it. But it is fine I will not be a jester for you anymore and you will be free from the burden I am. Goodbye. I will kill myself soon,Suicidal
20754,20774,Everything.Everything seems to be too much. Everything seems to be too late. Everything seems to be too evil. Everything seems to be too hopeless.I have an incredible boyfriend that I am planning on spending the rest of my life with. We just bought a house plan on 3 kids and I am soon getting on the long road for my dream job. I have a future but I really wonder about a lot of things.Its painful to think about but what is the point? The planet is dying. People are full of hate and corruption and evil are business models. Its all so sick and depressing.I have been mentally ill my whole life. I have no business having children especially as someone who is into environmentalism even though its the one thing I have wanted to do since I was little. I want to be a mother and raise my children to be stronger than myself to be the good in the world and live unapologetically and happily with all the love they could ever need or want. But it feels like the world is too far gone physically and socially. I feel like bringing children into a world that is worse off than when I was born is horrible and selfish.My boyfriend has wanted to be a father his entire life too. Were a perfect match and I was so blessed to find him. But if I ever decide that having children is not right after all he would understandably leave its a huge incompatibility in a relationship so I would not blame him. But I cannot live without him. I would rather die than live without him.I have not been suicidal in almost a year. I do not even really know if I am right now. I just want to scream out into the world. I want things to change for the better. I want kindness to prevail and I want people to see the beauty of the world they live in. I want people to live happily and safely. Its all very much a pipedream I know. I just do not know how much longer I can go on. I am too weak and pathetic and soft for this world and I just do not know what to do.The stress I face right now money paying for college my physical and mental health wear so heavily on me. I am 5 days sober from alcohol and xanax but damn it really hurts. Maybe I am just exhausted and burning out. But everything is really just too much right now. I am scared and losing hope.,Suicidal
20756,20776,If it works the way its supposed to ill be too sedated by the medication to tear the bag off my head especially if i belt two around my neck when it starts to kick in. Ill put a blanket over my head too in order to reduce the noise. I have tried so hard for so long but every single day feels so wrong. I have seen therapists. I have been to treatment facilities. I have been in the er countless times. I just do not understand why people try so hard for something so unforgiving. It is not worth pushing through constant pain and suffering. What pleasure is there to have? I have nothing. I have failed my entire life. I pushed away everyone. Dropped out cannot even hold a job or get a license because of all these thoughts. I idolize people who succeeded at killing themselves. I envy them. Knowing that the next step is unknown but taking the leap of faith to escape this hell. I am scared of the unknown but this pain is unbearable. I have heard it all and tried to believe it will hurt others for the rest of their lives live for them they need you its selfish. I think I am finally going through an attempt.,Suicidal
20784,20804,I cannot do this living thing anymore my mind is too messed up I hate feeling the way I do its making want to just give in to it all I have had enough. Living on borrowed time I reckon should have just done it properly when I had the chance. Should have down it properly when I had chance or run away,Suicidal
20802,20822,So I was feeling insanely suicidal more so than ever in my life. I am 20 no job very few friends. I texted my friends online that I was taking a mental health break and Id be gone. So that night I got very drunk for the first time and I was a wreck all over Twitter. Just voice audios of drunk me talking about being sad. And then I was finally ready to go. I went and found my dads gun which he kept in the bottom of a filing cabinet in his spare closet. I took a picture of it and posted it basically saying goodbye. The problem was that the gun was brand new and barely touched. It had some sort of safety feature on it I think? something coming from the barrel. I do not know anything about guns so drunk me was pissed as hell that I could not figure it out to the point I start sobbing. Anyways. I fall asleep in the spare closet. Dad comes home and finds me fiddling with his gun. Anyways. I am recovering now. After all this I worked up the courage to go back to my Twitter and see all my pitiful tweets. What really hurts me is that nobody reached out. I have about 10 friends on there that I interact with. Not a message. Some friends were even tweeting like normal a few hours after I posted the picture of the gun and goodbye. Am I being too dramatic? People did not even notice or care enough to reach out. That hurt me a lot to see. I expected to be profusely apologizing and feeling guilty for all of these friends but it was practically nobody. Feeling very unloved,Suicidal
20819,20839,To put some context I have been though some things in my life that I will probably explain in another post just a little summary when I was kid I was nearly raped by my cousin I never told to my family I grew up with some anxiety my parents were a bit strict with me like physically harm me and saying things like I am stupid and that kind of things when I was a child I now understand why and that is because my mother also had some mental issues that now she cured and we have a good relationship I think when I was like 10 I started thinking on suicide when I was sad and at some time when I was 13 to 15 yo I started self harming me to mitigate those thoughts I left it when I was 16 but sometimes the suicide thought came to my mind. I studied college and I still had that thoughts I started dating a girl when I was 20 and everything okay but when whenever we got a fight the same thoughts just appeared. Now I am 25 I will be moving to another country because I will start my graduate studies I still have my girlfriend but I still have suicide thoughts. My family and I are in good terms and we are close but I still think about suicide when I am sad. it is like my mind just imagines a place where I am happy where I do not feel like these like another live and my mind it is like oh yeah If we suicide we can probably get there!. Despite of the fact that I am actually happy with whatever I am doing I feel a lot of pressure but I think I am happy but I still get these times that I think on suicide. Once I tried to get some help with a psychiatrist and on the first session he wanted me to take lithium and I was like no wtf lithium causes so much harm and that is something that psychiatrist used to give a lot to patients. I just wanted to vent my situation any good advice or just a comment is well recieved I hope you all good. Whenever I am sad I think of suicide,Suicidal
20840,20860,I had a shit day. Absolutely fucking shit day. Honestly I wanted to hand in my two weeks at work so that my boss would have my replacement ready when I kill myself and then talked myself out of it. And then I finally fucking wrapped my head around the fact that this dude actually forced himself on me after he got me too fucked up and high. Honestly I thought it did not even happen. But fuck it came back to me and I feel like absolute fucking shit. I feel disgusting and I do not even want to be in my skin. And like other shit happened and when I was coming home I was hopeful and thought okay at least this day is over. And guess fucking what? My cat shat on the fucking floor. It stank up my entire apartment and it was from earlier in the day and I want to fucking kill myself. Now I feel ill be an asshole if this was the last straw Do I sound like a piece of shit if I kill myself because my cat shitting on the floor was the last straw?,Suicidal
20844,20864,Anybody up and willing to chat I could use it right now Any body still awake?,Suicidal
20854,20874,My father thinks I am a freak and wants me to kill myself.My mother is disappointed that I turned out like this.I get daily comments from my brother shit like you will never be a man its just a phase you do not have a dick and balls do that means you are a girl you are so dumbdelusional you think you are a guy etc etc. they are so ashamed of me that they refuse to let me come out to my extended family they even wanted me to not tell my friend but of course I did not listen. I get misgendered and deadnamed daily not just by my family but by people at school I have already been threatened to be killed for being trans by some guy. I was lied to for so long my parents told me that they would love me no matter who I become but its all a fucking lie because I am not the perfect cishet mentally stable daughter they wanted instead they got a fucked up trans faggot son. I could of turned out to be some serial killer and they would of preferred that over me being trans. If my family want me to hurry up and die already they just need to say so I know exactly where a train is and Ill gladly sit down on the rail roads. I mean my father has already told me to go kill myself but Ill listen to what he says if he tells me to kms again or anyone else in my family says to. None of them bother to listen to me so at this point Ill need to kill myself to prove that my gender dysphoria is real and that their words have consequences. Ffs my mother tried to gaslight me into believing that I was not trans when I came out to her. I doubt Ill make it to see 2022 and to be honest I hope I do not I am so sick of this shit. What tf did I do to deserve this kind of torture? Why could not I just be born normal? I am cursed with gender dysphoria and an unsupportive family FTM,Suicidal
20860,20880,I was planning on kms before I turned 18 but obviously that did not happen. I am very depressed and confused. I have no friends and I am failing school. I wish I could just disappear. Its my 18 birthday and I am currently crying myself to sleep.,Suicidal
20909,20929,I do not have the energy to make a throwawayI just feel drained been depressed all my life things were starting to work out then I lost it all and now I struggle to enjoy anything. My meds do not help anymoreCan't find a solutionI have a method and an approximate dateDeep down I do not want to die I just do not see an alternative I have nothing to look forward to except more loneliness and hardshipsI might move out on my own soon and I have no friends no job no passion no hope for the future. The thought of me alone in an empty apartment haunts me at every waking hour and I do not know how to deal with itWill probably delete the thread soon after posting cannot feel anything anymore meds do not work relationships crumbling no hope on the horizon,Suicidal
20984,21004,They do not take it seriously even if I was bullied. They all say its my fault. They laugh at me I also got banned from the YouTube subreddit. They do not get how much it hurts when others make fun and laugh at me how it affects me how my whole week just gets ruined because of it! I want to kill myself everyone is just laughing at me!,Suicidal

21123,21143,I am happier with being a cannibalistic necropedophile and I desire nothing more than human extinction now. I want to eat human flesh. I am a wendigo and I will burn with you all. I am going to kill my psychiatrist and rape his children in child snuff porn.,Suicidal
21157,21177,Things are just stacked against some people from the start. I did not have a happy childhood I was severely depressed and bullied hard through high school college was a downward spiral.I am in my mid20s with a low contact family and no real friendships. My only dating history was a yearlong abusive nightmare. My job is so highstress its causing physical illness. I have been so depressed for so long that I cannot even pretend to have interest in doing anything at all.Therapy helped earlyon but its just stagnated I have stayed alive but nothing has meaningfully changed. Medication is the same. Adding yet another to the cocktail brought me from being in constant pain to feeling absolutely nothing at all. I honestly think its worse. I want to kill myself just as badly and I no longer have the constraint of being to exhausted to do so.And I mean really what is the point? I drag myself through daysweeksmonths of this until eventually I die? I have felt this way for 17 years. The best life has to offer is chucking pills down my throat to give me some false sense that life is not just immeasurable pain. there is nothing in my life to be happy or content about and I am just expected to numb myself into oblivion and pretend its better. I hate it. This is the best life can offer. What a joke,Suicidal
21212,21232,is playing with me. It calculates how much i can struggle It enjoys when I am pain otherwise it would not do it if i were happy.I cannot speak to it does not listen to me.I imprison my consciousness which I feel as my own in my body as if it were poison. My consciousness,Suicidal
21224,21244,I am 22 now going on 23 and for the past 13 years of my life everyday I think of killing myself. I hate the life I live. I hate the person I am. I hate the situation I am in. I just want it all to end. I hate this life. Hate feeling like this,Suicidal

21276,21296,every day my family demands more from me.every day things I like are taken away from me.I am not worth having good things or happiness anyway.If I find comfort in something i immediately need to be reminded that it is a loan given by someone else.Nothing I have is my own.Everything can and will be taken away from me.I cannot afford and do not deserve any of the good things in my life.The good things should be taken away from me.The only way to continue to the next day is to tear myself apart.I want to die so bad every day I get more exhausted,Suicidal
21283,21303,fuck sake. I feel really really low and overwhelmed tonight. I do not know what i can do when i try to turn my mood around and find positives i just return to the dark place again. i am struggling to stay fooat. i keep thinking about how to do it and the thought alone was comforting but now it just seems like the only option i do not know how to make it all stop i cannot stop the thoughts...,Suicidal
21289,21309,I am broke but have found money to drink like usual. I do not have a drinking problem I have an escaping from my feelings problem. Sometimes its food or tv or games or my phone. But. The thing is this week is so important. I have several interviews for high paying jobs. I will not be broke anymore. But instead of celebrating I still want to die. I do not want to do this all by myself anymore. I am all alone financially supporting myself my bf my animals. I love them all and I do not want to leave. But they deserve better. I do not know. I am broke lol,Suicidal
21368,21388,Ill never be but I keep dreaming. Those lucky people who fit the beauty standards . People always treat them better . Its just not fair I really just want to be pretty,Suicidal
21369,21389,I am genuinely heartbroken. I loved him and thought wed spend our lives together apparently he was really unhappy in our relationship and now I feel awful. I lost the thing that kept me going I loved him so fucking much and was always happy around him. I did not realise I made him sad apparently all I ever am is negative and I am boring to be around because I have difficulty understanding things. I hate this and want to end my life I get really attached to people and then they leave me. What am I doing wrong? I am scared its because I was molested a lot as a child and have become apprehensive of physical and sexual contact. I hate it he was the only thing I had and I have lost it Got broken up with out of nowhere,Suicidal
21382,21402,I guess that is my take about depression. Kept thinking of death. I am forced to love suffering all day long. Depression causes you to think about reality and feel overwhelmed at the same time your mind is corrupting slowly without even you noticing it.,Suicidal
21385,21405,I know the title probably explains something 1000s perhaps 1000000000s are going through. The only thing keeping me alive right now is my faith and religion. And even that is starting to just not help me. I wrote a note the other day. I was so close. I had the knife in my hand ready to go. I just do not know what is keeping me anymore. Everyone thinks I am living a great good live. That I am happy and an average high school football player. That shit does not make me happy football the love of my life does not make me happy. Religion does not make me happy. Two things that at one point gave me unbelievable joy in my life. Maybe I am a coward for wanting this all to end. Maybe I am ungrateful for the opportunity I got from life. I just want my dad again. I want to see him again. And if it means taking a shot at death then fuck it I got nothing to live for anymore. I am a nobody and always will be. I wish I was never born. I wish I could give my life to someone who will discover the cure for cancer or AIDS actually make a difference. I am doing it. I wrote my note to family. This is my goodbye to the internet. I tried with all my heart to live a good life. I do not want to die. I just.. this pain is unbearable.,Suicidal
21396,21416,Dear life Thank you so much. you have taught me many things. I am forever grateful for all the good things and the bad things. It was too much and I could not handle the pain anymore. I wish I was better. I wish I was. P Ps. Mom do not be sad. I love you. This is it. Been waiting for six years for this day.,Suicidal
21412,21432,I am honestly ok with dying. I am willing to go through that pain to get to where i want to and my plan is not that painful anyway carbon monoxide suffocation maybe with sleeping pills so i can driff off to sleep and never come back i will not feel a thingbut I am scared ill do it wrong. I am scared i might mess up or i accidentally survive or something and i know life after that point will be completely different and worse because ill have to go to therapy or some shit and i do not want to do that. i do not want to fix myselfthats one of the biggest things keeping me from committing die so now I am just stuck in a loop of confusion suffering and wishing that i do not wake up the next morning have a good day you all not scared of death OR dying but scared of surviving,Suicidal
21421,21441,I am just so fucking done. Thinking about it I would be forgotten within barely a generation. I matter to absolutely no one. The only note I would leave is to beg my parents not to destroy my art works because I know my dad would do that if he had the chanceIt is a stupid thing to care about but I hate that every person who called me a loser pathetic nothing etc were actually right. I am sure they will get a kick out of my death not to mention a good laugh. Took Loads of Prozac and Went Looking for a Good Spot to Hang Myself.,Suicidal
21435,21455,I lost count of how many times i heard these things Hold on a little longer things will get better when will it be better ? I cannot handle more time like this I am so exhausted from trying to fight back and trying to overcome all my problems. I do not want to live another day with all this. I am tired of holding on,Suicidal
21452,21472,life is just getting harder I am suffering mentally and physically everydayand jesus christ I am going to be in the army next weekidk if I could handle it what I am trying to say that life is just so scaryit is so hardthe responsibilities and pain that I feel on my shoulder go away when I think about doing it it is comforting thinking like thatdeep down I do not want to do it But I feel like I am hanging by a thread it is so easy and comfortable to have a plan to kill yourself,Suicidal
21469,21489,I almost killed myself last night. Then I almost cut myself again. Then I was lonley. No one cares for me. They hate me as I tag along with them sticking to them like glue. Everyone I meet quickly starts to dislike me and distances thenselves from me. I cannot do anything about it. The only way I can change my personality is if I am quiet and shy. And they still hate me because sometimes the old me comes back. Its bullshit. I hate me I almost jumped in front of a car last night,Suicidal
21501,21521,on the surface i do not have any reason for suicidal thoughts and maybe people would think I am ungrateful but really what is all this struggle about? i mean i have friends that support me. i have a family which is financially not good but always has my back. shit I am only 20 years old. my grades are not very good but I am in a college which is quite good among the other colleges in my country. but why am i having these difficulties for a future? i do not want to give birth i do not want a family I am not ambitious about my career i do not have any kind of passion for life i do not have anything to look forward to. so why? why should i keep feeling these burdens when i can just end it? if i knew my family would not be devastated i would just end my life in the blink of an eye. with no hesitation what are all these struggles about?,Suicidal
21504,21524,I find it hard to talk about this if I am honest and I do not want to just rant if I can help it. But I am at a point where I just feel worthless I feel like my existence does not contribute in any way. I am 30 and still do not know what I am doing with my life. I have lost jobs and friends and feel completely alone.Truth is I just want to die. But I have had trouble committing to it. I attempted it once but now lately I have been sort of reckless.Drinking crossing the road without looking and other what others would consider reckless stupidity. But I cannot help it.I just do not want to be here.I am done. I just do not want to be here.,Suicidal
21528,21548,I do not know if I make sense. I want to leave everything just disappear for a while and not having to deal with anything. Not seeing my family and friends no internet nothing. Is checking into psychiatric hospital voluntarily worth it? Will it help? Would it make things worse? Can I just go into a forest and become a hermit? Are there any other ways? Like not committing suicide but just stop existing for a while,Suicidal
21537,21557,Its been exactly one year. 11th July 2020. I tried failed and ended up snapping some ligaments from landing on my ankle unconscious. I have since gotten surgery to fix it and now I have a massive scar. Also I have developed arthritis and multiple slipped discs that HURT all the time. Some days its so bad that I think about killing myself just to escape the physical pain. I am really really fucking angry with myself last year. Why the FUCK did I not hide all the scissors and knives? that is how it got interrupted. My mother cut me down from the perfect hanging set up I had. Just a few more minutes and I would be AT PEACE. Guess what? Today I am 10kg heavier since that day. I still wish I was free. But NOOOOOOO I have to stay here on this bitch of an earth. I honestly see why drugs help people. Weed on occasion has helped me to calm down. But I would love to just be freed of all these worries. Being 19 and having had these thoughts since I was 6 years old I feel like I have suffered enough. Back pain is a bitch. Without it I honestly would not still be feeling so suicidal. that is just how excruciating the physical pain is. RANT One year since my attempt,Suicidal
21578,21598,First and foremost please save the dramatics because I have already made my mind up and my decision is final. Please know there is nothing you can or could do.I am jealous of people in mental wealth wards. that is where I want to be. But I do not think I would qualify as I am not outwardly a danger to myself or others. I have been through the healthcare system multiple times and it only ever made me worse. I am on 100mg of sertraline and all it is done is made me more anxious and I cannot even enjoy music anymore. I cannot cry anymore I cannot laugh anymore I cannot cum anymore TMI I know. I am convinced at this point there is nothing I can do to ever make things better. Not to sound like the joker lmao but society is fucked. I hate it. People are evil. Capitalism is evil. I do not want any part in this and I would rather spend the rest of my life in isolation.I have attempted to end things twice before but failed. Once due to cowardice and the second due to luck. I got better for a while or at least I thought I did but after COVID things have just completely collapsed and I am worse than I ever have been. I cannot deal with my brain constantly. I have no idea how I am supposed to navigate my way through this hellscape of a world with a brain that constantly makes things 10x more difficult. I am 21 years old I am so anxious I cannot leave the house unemployed just dropped out of university I have literally no friends and all the friends I have had in the past I have ended up pushing away. I have nasty intrusive thoughts all the time too awful to even say out loud. I am not comfortable in my own skin. I have no idea what I am doing with my life. I have tried so hard to do good and be good but I have realised the problem is not me it is the world. The world is fucked and I do not want to be in it.So I have a plan for tonight. I have got 20 packs of Aspirin and I am going to swallow as many as I can. I will wash it down with vodka. I am going to put my favourite album on and turn the volume up all the way. My parents will be out at the pub drinking and watching the football. I have never cared for football so it is not surprising to them that I am staying home. They will not be out all night though and will probably return at 10 or 1030pm. So the way I see it either they come home too late and I am already dead OR they come home call an ambulance and I miraculously survive. At least then they will probably take me seriously and throw me in a ward where I belong.And yeah I am posting this for attention. Do I want pity? Yeah probably. Just say you love me and tell me not to do it and feel sorry for me and all that. It will not do anything but at least it might give me a little bit of serotonin before I take the gamble.If you are suicidal yourself reading this stop lurking this sub. Get help. Reading stuff on here is not going to make you feel any better it is an echochamber of suicidal ideations. Get off of here for your own good. Well I think this is it.,Suicidal
21611,21631,I am 26 and I am about to jump in front of a car If I hear my parents having sex I am going to kill myself,Suicidal
21628,21648,fuck I am so sad please its all too much happiness is almost painful because I am waiting for the facade the fake icing to fall to crash down and burn up any hope or inspiration i had I am supposed to have it all figured out I am supposed to but does it even matter? i cannot get out of my damn head what am i doing?,Suicidal
21632,21652,Think about when I am happy it is just chemicals in my brain.When I am angry it is just chemicals in my brain controlling my emotions. When I am embarrassed it is just chemicals in my brain dictating my emotionsI could go on forever.Why live if my all my feelings are dictated by something that does not have to deal with them?Sorry if this does not belong here I might delete it later. I just realized all I am is a slave to chemicals in my brain,Suicidal
21646,21666,Constant urge to off myself. Been depressed 11 years it never fucking gets better despite your generic shit BS advice. Been rejected and unwanted by all women my whole life. I am scared I am going to turn into an angry incel or something. Lately I have been so damn lonely it hurts so much. I feel constant pain and it hurts so much. I truly think medication made me worse. I used to be more numb now medication makes me feel something but only more PAIN. No wonder suicide rates go higher on medication. Fuck big pharma. I hate life. I feel constant pain,Suicidal
21699,21719,My bank account is empty. I cannot afford cigarettes or drugs to make me feel anything. So I started cutting again. I am off my parents insurance next year so even if I do not kill myself soon I guess not being able to afford my meds will. I would just rather not die homeless I guess. I have no job no higher education huge gaps in my resume that have fucked me over trying to get a job. I need to spend egregious amounts of money on my medicine just to survive and drugs just to want to. Well now I cannot afford either. Maybe if I could afford therapy I would feel better. There is just no reason to keep living Chronically ill and poor,Suicidal
21803,21823,Honestly cannot remember the last time i was happy. do not even remember what happiness feels like could not describe the feeling for a million dollars.But pain on the other hand is very familiar. I can describe what pain and hurt feels like excrutiatingly well. The fucking irony. Its like life is a path full of pain with small insignificant moments of happiness you do not even remember the feeling of. What the fuck is the point of living then? I am supposed to keep stumbling and pushing through for what? what is waiting for me? More pain and suffering until i die. there is good days and bad days tell me why the fuck i cannot remember any of the good days? Where the fuck was my share of good days? Where was my share of happiness? Pain amp Happiness,Suicidal
21820,21840,earlier yesterday i heard my mother on the phone with a potential therapist of mine. getting to know her. not asking me to talk to her to see if i felt comfortable. for context i said that i felt suicidal to a therapist and they told my school gt told my mom had me sent home for the rest of the year. due to that i cannot go back without getting cleared by a doctor because they do not want to deal with students with mental health issues. anyways I have always been the thirdwheel in my own recovery. i never know what is happening with my medication my status as a student at my school or the therapists i might see. on the phone my mom is trying to explain to the new therapist why I am feeling this wayits because of covid you know all teenagers are depressed now.i do not think she fully understands the fact that I have been struggling with this for years. in middle school i was lazy and not motivated to do anything at all. i constantly missed school and did poor with everything. sophomore year before covid hit i was seeing a therapist and breaking down every session because i really did not want to live with myself. i got a really bad ankle sprain my social anxiety took over me and i did not eat for weeks. this is not new but she is acting like it is. my close friend passed because of suicide and i think she magically wants me to realize that it is not the answer.I am in no way complaining about my mom trying to get help for me but it feels like she is being forced to do it which she is. she constantly tells me do you want them to kick you out of school? and prioritizes me being at the school i am over my mental health. all of this pressure to not say the wrong thing while I am meeting with the therapist only makes it harder to be alive knowing I am disappointing so many people. invalidated,Suicidal
21823,21843,I am done. Next time i fuck up i will kill myself by slitting both my wrists. I do not want to live on this planet anymore. I hope I fuck up soon so this all can end. My suicide plans,Suicidal
21830,21850,I am done with my life I cannot go on anymore planning on killing myself when I hit 30,Suicidal

21880,21900,I might do it tonight. The few people who I felt loved by I do not think like me anymore. I panicked and tried to give people a sign I am not okay and now I think they all hate me more. I am tired of living with constant anxiety. I just give up for the first time in my life. I always tried to power through negative thoughts but its too much now. I fuck everything up,Suicidal
21890,21910,I am turning 19 soon but I still view myself as a kid not a teenager like a 1011 year old who never really grew up. I also look quite young and cannot really associate myself with most people my age. Sometimes I wish I could be friends with people that r 1213 but I would not do that bc its kind of creepy and weird i know that but I just do not feel real I still feel like a child,Suicidal
21900,21920,I am starving and i just cannot take it anymore. there is no help n no love or hope for me. Homeless hungry and going to end it all tonight,Suicidal
21915,21935,I am turning 18 in a couple days and have literally no friends and am absolutely shit at anything socially i feel so much pressure to be the happy sociable dude everyone around sees me as but in reality I am so fucking lonely and unhappy and die of anxiety thinking of even getting close to people let alone tell them I am struggling i just wish i had someone i could talk to that had no expectations for me. I do not even want to fucking kill myself i just do not want to live with all this anger and loneliness anymore What the fuck is the point anymore,Suicidal
21971,21991,I Can post the letter I sent to her. But this to teach men to speak instead of bottling as I did. And I want you to use this to speak as men. To understand the impact it can have on a person My Quote to you as a speaker and I how I see things I do not think anyone is truly human until they have gone through a mental health battle. And I also believe to be human you need to sympathise and understand each other on a emotional level. Its a healthy way of communication and bringing people to closer for support. Mental health is SO important I think people need to understand otherwise the issue of not talking will only continue for men and women. It may create tramua and because people to close in there next relationship causing a relapse. People will always experience stress and anxieties from different situations. And depending on how important that person was to you will effect how bad your breakdown was off bottling true emotions. As mine breakdown was not talking to my ex Girlfriend Emma due to the situation of covid distance and jobs not coping well it broke me. I did not tell her until 5 months after we split. So anyone who reads this before ending a life seek help and talk to your person. its how you react and causing self harm you will only create more damage to yourself and the people around you. I have done this with my Relationship with her. I decided to end it just because it broke me mentally from the drastic impact and stress I had trying I be with her. but I was on the edge with her not her fault at all she was brilliant. I was struggling because covid made it impossible to get a job 3 hours away. BUT I WAS SO COMMITTED. I loved her. that is what you do for someone you love. I just ignored When she gone I was like no point now. I might as well. Now the truth has come out to her as it has she only thinks I am crazy or just to give it. Maybe I was easy for a little bit. Bottling for such a long time does that to you. Trying to take meds caused me schizophrenia. Until I just had a breakdown a complete breakdown. And it did break me. I attempted to end my life 3 times. One from Caffeine over does. 2 carbon monoxide. I had 1000 pills. The mental health Crisis team tried to make me hate like she cheated because I was depressed and created theories in my head You are not insane. You are normal.You are just connected with your emotions. In a much deeper way. than other people are around you. It will get better. I am struggling to let her go due to the losing her from mental health as a best mate. But overall I am doing better. And I will beat this. So to anyone struggling give that person space. Take your time. It will get better. And you will find answers about why you felt a certain way or different than to your normal self I can post my ENTIRE letter. For anyone that is interested My views on mental health. This is my story.,Suicidal

Even my relationship with my gf.Every slight bit that does not work perfect and boom my mind and head are on and try to make me feel bad. Just everything is completely worthless in this moment no hope nothing.In the last weeks it got so far that even some of my feelings were overwhelmed and turned sides because my gf was too busy and i felt ignored even now she has something to do.While she has work to do i sit here knowing i have to end the relationship regret losing my team position on a game server which was my highest achievement for almost 8 years know that i am useless because i have canceled my study which means i have no future about my work and distanced from almost all my friends.All this just because my head and mind hates me and wants to see me suffer and be alone.I am just sitting here and doing things i have never done like trying to cut my arms with blades from a scissor and hittingpunching my head.

I cannot keep living like this. cannot stop thinking about stabbing myself,Suicidal

22227,22247,I am sitting alone in my room trying my hardest not to cry.I am alone. I am all alone. Everyone is going out to lunch or to dinner with everyone. I do not think anyone will care enough to even call. Even if they do it will all sound so meaningless and fake. I am going to turn my phone off and watch Netflix in bed all day tomorrow.Maybe I deserve it. For having a loud voice for being fat for just existing. This is my punishment. I am destined to be miserable. I am too scared to die. it is like an endless loop. I have accepted it I am just done. 4 hours and 8 minutes left for my birthday.,Suicidal

22247,22267,I am sorry for this vent. I have no one to tell this to. I lost all of my friends this week. I fucked up in a huge way because of my inner turmoil. I did bad things to them like lie broke their trust spoke poorly of them. I know my actions warrant losing them. But I loved them somehow despite all of this. I am so alone right now and its scary and painful. I know this is the consequence of my actions. But it hurts so much and I do not know what to do. And I recently broke up with my boyfriend. My chest and head feels like its going to explode. I went to the hospital earlier this week but did not get admitted to inpatient. I am scared to try to get help again because I am afraid of it failing. Ill feel more hopeless than I do now. I feel like there is no redeeming myself. I want to get better and I want to change but its hard when no one can be there with you along the way. I have no one to talk to. I tried reaching out to more people but life circumstances prevent us from talking. I am scared and I can feel myself getting more desperate. I cannot see a way out of feeling like this,Suicidal
22251,22271,Any quick ways to just end it all?? genuinely asking. please someone tell me how i can kill myself rq,Suicidal
22266,22286,i usually stop overthinking by self harm. i usually cut myself and rarely burn. i do not know anyway else to stop overthinking. whenever i overthink i want to be alone. i do not want anybody near me. i do not know what to do. please help I cannot stop overthinking and I do not know why. I keep telling myself I am overthinking but then i think I am overthinking that I am overthinking and i cannot stop. its a never ending cycle,Suicidal
22274,22294,I imagine the seemingly normal things I am going to do on my last day and then the part when I end it all. Thinking about that part fills me with a sense of calmness. Finally being able to escape my problems. Finally leaving the shitty people who make my life miserable. Its all I have ever wanted and death will give it to me. do not tell me it gets better because the chances of my situation getting better are not guaranteed. Dying does scare me a little bit but if I do not die now I will inevitably die later in life. Why live in pain for longer? Death is bliss and I want the courage to meet up with it. Thinking of killing myself makes me really happy,Suicidal

22300,22320,Everything goes to shit regardless of how hard I try to be okay no matter how much I fight everything always comes crumbling down. Why do I even try to live anymore? what is the point? This world is so cold I am just a burden I only make things worse. I do not deserve to live in this world. Why do I even try?,Suicidal
22313,22333,Two of the worst things that ever happened to me happened in July. I was raped then a few days later I was in a massive accident that ruined my spine leaving me immobile from the pain for a year. I lost my twenties to this shit. I cannot get my life back. there is no point and I am sooooo fucking tired of the it gets better do it for someone else. People are awful. They just ruin your and themselves and others. You ruin others. I ruin them. I am tired of dreaming of the ways Id do it. I just want the courage to actually go. I hate this world and everyone in it. July is Awful,Suicidal

22361,22381,My boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me and hes in love with someone else now. I am struggling to find a job. I have no friends. I feel like a failure. I just want to end it all. I can usually shake off these thoughts but I cannot do it today. Someone help me I want to end it all,Suicidal
22379,22399,I experience breakdowns everyday. Even when in my dreams I am breaking down. I do not want to go on like this anymore. Breakdowns everyday,Suicidal
22419,22439,Am I that difficult to love? I am questioning,Suicidal
22420,22440,there is too much to say and I want to keep this simple. I feel so weak and disconnected from reality. Nothing has ever been ok with me especially since my dad died five years ago and then two years ago realizing I have been living a lie. Even long before then nothing has ever felt normal.I have never felt stable and I do not think I ever will. My social anxiety is so so bad. I feel constantly threatened by everyone when I am out in public I feel like I could be attacked any moment I am outside somewhere alone.I die inside from people seeing my disgusting outer she will of myself instead of how I have always wanted to be seen. I scream internally from the tragic fact that I have never had a close female friend or a childhood where I could have really grown to be my own womanly self you know? I feel fucking robbed.I have never kept a job longer than four months in the past five years... because there always comes a point where my social anxiety goes through the roof every time. In one instance I had a near psychotic episode during which I felt like reaching for a gun. It freaked me because it came out of nowhere. it is sad too because most of them have been parttime jobs. I just feel pathetic because my body cannot handle any amount of manual labor anymore and my mind cannot handle people. I feel so weak and fucked. I hate the fact that we are all cursed to work and throw away the best years of our lives until we can finally retire with less than a couple decades to enjoy the rest of our weakened crippled existence. I do not like work and I do not like it period. I am almost at the point where I am considering crime or something. Maybe I can go wreck something and scream at the top of my lungs and get myself sent to a psych ward maybe that could get me disability... probably not. Maybe injure and permanently handicap myself. I am just desperate ok? I should have never been stripped of the disability I was getting up until I turned 18 I was diagnosed with mild autism so that is why I was getting it but they removed my eligibility the moment I became a legal adult... even though they should not have because if anything I am way more fucked up and disabled now. You want to know what I like? What my passion is? The only thing in the entire universe that sets my heart aflame? it is writing but not just writing it is writing these sci fifantasy stories I have been having in my head since childhood. I do not ever want to work as a writer because making it a standard job would kill my only passion forever and if that is gone then I am definitely gone..So yeah I have always wanted to make a series of graphic novels based on these childhood stories of mine. And I feel so stupid for not getting serious about it till a couple months ago. I am writing a thousand words a day just to practice and to hopefully improve as time goes on. I have been paying a wonderful artist bits of my dwindling money to make these beautiful concept arts of my main characters... this is what makes me still feel alive. To share my stories. I do not even care if I make that much money out of it. I can be poor the rest of my life and if one or two people like my story my life is complete. But it is so hard to maintain my hope. I feel like I am treated like shit with every job I attempt. I currently looking at a sign spinner job lol which seems promising. it is crazy though... I do not ask for much just a few hours a day like 3 or 4 preferably 3... I do not want to work longer than I typically write each day and yet the world seems to ask too much of my fucked up self.... My money is running out and I hope I find something tolerable. Because I am getting closer and closer to just wanting a car to hit me or something. Do I want to commit suicide? I do not know. I have a lot going for me with my writing... if I die a universe dies with me. But I hate myself and how I am so broken lost and delirious that I cannot ever feel like a normal human... like it makes me want to hurt myself a lot. Thank you so much if you have taken the time to listen to my venting. do not mind me just a mentally ill trans girl who feels like she will never be able to keep a job and has little to no future...,Suicidal

22451,22471,I somehow managed to stop feeling suicidal for a few months and now I am back to being miserable. Like I do not think I am cut out for this. I really do not think I can handle life. I wish it was not so hard all the time. I am back,Suicidal
22472,22492,But it feels like my only last option if I do not do it I will live the rest of my life in pain. It sucks alot. I hate how suicide is consider selfish like why do people care anyways? Why cannot they care while the person is alive giving hints that they want to kill themselves. And then when it actually happens everyone all of a sudden starts caring. I had a friend who literally told everyone that he wanted to kill himself. The very next month he hung himself and everyone started caring then why did not they care before?!?! If I knew that he was feeling the way he felt I would of gotten help for him as soon as possible and I would of helped him with his financial situation. But it was too late. it is been a year since his death. I am sorry for the long vent it just confuses me when people only care when your dead. I told my family in vivid detail about what I am going to do to myself and all they said was do not do that like wtf is that going to do take me to the hospital damn it lol I really do not want to do this,Suicidal
22493,22513,for as long as i can remember I have known my because of death will be suicide. as fucked up as it sounds its comforting to think about.all the these years of fighting 20 meds countless treatments programs and therapists only to be worse off every single time is no longer something ill participate in.all i do is create unnecessary issues for everyone around me. I am a parasite amongst my world of people. to them i just need to figure it out and do the things i know I am supposed to do but am simply choosing not to do to them I am choosing this life for myself. i guess you could say at this point i am choosing suicide. that would be fair. but only after nothing helped even the slightest. after years of wondering why I am on this earth dealing with this and gaining little to no insight I am tired. I have been fighting this simply to not hurt anybody anymore but that motive is quickly dwindling. its actually nonexistent now. I am simply done. my life is a sick joke put into motion by somehow fucking every single thing up. something so screwy like me does not deserve to breath the air this earth provides. its such a waste. but anyways i hope and pray for relief in all of your hearts tonight. and to mom dad noah and eli i love you so fucking much and I am so sorry for not being strong enough to get through this. i tried so hard it just was not enough. love sam weird knowing how ill die.,Suicidal
22514,22534,I get really angry and suicidal because people see me as inferior to them. Like I am not good enough to be loved because I am seen as inferior in this social hierarchy where people like me are not wanted and seen as inferior to others. This is the reason I am so suicidal. The big main reason I am even suicidal in the first place. I am tired of feeling inferior to other people and unloved,Suicidal
22530,22550,I have nothing left and my life looks so much worse than I could have ever thought possible I just think I am going to end it I want to die any day now have nothing left to live for,Suicidal
22560,22580,When I was 10 I touched a lady's chest area when she was sleeping...also I used to have some pretty bad thoughts some of them were fantasies and I think that I have no right to live after what I did...please be honest with me and tell me if I have the right to live I made unforgivable mistakes and I have no right to live,Suicidal
22574,22594,i honestly do not know how much longer i can go. I have attempted many times in the past by overdosing but sadly survived. one of the biggest reasons why I am still here is bc i do not want my parents to have to bury me. i do not want to pass my pain onto others but i really do not have much left in me. i have dreams amp goals but they seem so impossible with depression draining me amp suicide on my mind 247. I have been to the psych ward many times tried many different medications amp have seen therapists. my friends amp family are supportive but they really do not understand. i just wish i was already gone. cannot keep going,Suicidal
22576,22596,It provides more relief than my antidepressants Why does screaming and pulling out my hair make me happy,Suicidal
22613,22633,The birds chirp so I will die.is not it funny the difference between the sentence than is the title and the first sentence in this post. One indicates to me that the birds chirping is a sign that I will die while the other implies the birds are somehow chirping to help contribute to my dying. I am suffering so I would prefer to die.I am suffering so I would prefer to die. The Birds Chirp So I Will Die,Suicidal
22622,22642,My twin betrayed me and it cost me some of my vision. I have no one to talk to besides my mom. I really want to be held but no one loves me that way. I just got rejected by someone who never really cared anyways. I just need to hear positivity to get me through today. It will take 7 years if I am lucky to get my eyes back. I am REALLY trying to see the positives. I wish I could sleep till then because sleeping is the only escape from reality right now. I cannot even run away from my problems. I need some positive words please,Suicidal
22661,22681,I do not know where else to vent or turn to..I feel like a failed partner mom friend and woman. My man works hours and hours everyday while I sit on my ass..I clean but it will never be good enough to me. I have cats that soil the carpet but they mean the world to me and I know I should get rid of them. I have no money no job and I feel like a worthless mooch. I was abused by every man I have loved including my sons father. Now that I have met a man that actually takes care of me I cannot do anything right. I just feel so empty and exhausted and do not know what to do anymore. I am just overwhelmed at this point.. I feel like a failed woman,Suicidal
22697,22717,got to love the US it would be cheaper for my family to bury me than to have me treated,Suicidal
22702,22722,I plan to commit suicide somewhere in midAugust. I witnessed how my parents fought one time at a resort where my mother tried to bash my father's head with a table lamp. For the first 4 years of school I was bullied heavily. On my first day I got a mass beating because I cried on the celebration lineup. What followed is a big fight me vs everybody else in my class and a lot of hate towards my teachers. The 8 years of that school are some of the worst I can remember partially because of my unstable mother. At some point my parents got divorced and my father was not living with us for a long time but he could visit me. One time we went to a park but for some reason stopped at the place he was renting. When I got back my mother sensed something was odd and asked me what it was. She told me there would be no consequences If I told the truth. So I did. What followed is my most horrific memory to date. To put it simply it involved a lot of slurs directed at me and my father screaming and beating an expensive highend plasma tv with a hammer. Things calmed down since then my parents now share the same apartment I completed my basic education and so on. But something just never left me. A feeling of uselessness desire to not exist anymore. It became apparent to me around 2 years ago and it got a somewhat of a deadline 6 months ago. Basically my situation is bad. The exams I studied for with very good and professional teachers from another school came out bad. Like I got my place in my university only because of some contest. And it did not pan out. I chose translation as my profession with the English and German languages. This summer I was to take my firstyear exam. German was a complete failure. I can retake it in September but it will not do much why if the past year did not do it? Basically I have nowhere to go. If I will retake the exams they will come out even worse and my current scores will not get me into any university or college at all.For my whole life I felt like I do not belong here like I was a mistake. Well it seems to be true. It is sad I will not get to witness my nineteenth birthday. How my cat's going to grow up. It is sad that I will leave my parents with no hope for the future. But it would be even more sad to live off them for the rest of my life or to end up homeless. I am scared but ultimately it does not change anything. In the end we are all ants on a big rock that is going to boil us alive. My absence is insignificant. I do not know where to go anymore,Suicidal
22704,22724,My patience for other people is dwindling. I no longer enjoy talking to my friends. I am no longer interested in what I used to call my hobbies. How come I have to speak in a positive tone when I am feeling like this. How come when I say something in a negative tone its my fault and I am the bad guy. Why cannot people respect my space. When I say leave me alone my family demonizes me. I used to be bubbly optimistic and outgoing. Now I hate the world and see life for what it isa big waste of time and were only here because of biological purposes. To survive so we can fuck and produce more offspring so that our genes can thrive. there is nothing deep about it no bigger picture. God fuck I wish I had the guts to kill myself but I do not. Scratched my arm to the point where it feels a little numb.,Suicidal
22747,22767,Someone just watch over my dog please I think todays the day I might do it,Suicidal
22760,22780,I have never felt so lonely in my life. My friends went out without me they said they would get a day that suits everyone but still went ahead. they are of course posting about it and I feel so shit. Over the last couple of weeks I have been realising just how fake they are. They posted into our group chat photos which usually is normal its easier to send them into the gc the following day so everyone has them but tonight they put them in on the same night?? They could of made another gc but no they put it in the one I am in. I thought they were trying to rub it in my face so I thought Ill act like I am not annoyed and compliment the photos but then one replied omg I feel so bad for you and I said its fine dw did you end up going to this place and one of them just left me on read so I deleted the chat. I have just never felt so lonely I really do not have anyone I have no real friends and my relationship with my family is not good so I am so alone. I just really want to die rn I am sick of being lonely,Suicidal
22868,22888,I am having some tantrums and i have a dog that does not respect me and is always biting me and preferring others to me and on two occasions one of which today i ended up hitting her they were slippers actually and another dog. I had never hit her before and she is already 3 years old I am completely against it and I planned to never hit her in my life. I feel like a monster and I think this is just one more reason for me to kill myself I feel like a monster and I think this is just one more reason for me to kill mysel,Suicidal
22879,22899,I have always been bad at expressing my emotions although as someone who has spent a great deal of time blocking them out I suppose it is my fault.there is a constant sense of isolation. I am not as important as everyone else. My existence does not seem as necessary as theirs. I am standing still whilst everyone else goes up ahead. I am sure they would ideally want me to come along it just does not seem plausible.Weeks pass by as I sit here purposeless lacking the energy to do anything about it.No education no aspirations. Just me and my thoughts.There is one person she is the only one who gives me any sense of hope. Nowadays it seems as if I am burdening her more than anything and I do not want that. Her happiness is what holds priority to me regardless whether I am part of that or not.Most nights are spent completely restless and the ones that are not are no better dreams of abandonment occur almost every time.Then there is being raised in a religious household. Whether the afterlife is real or not I could not tell you it is still enough to terrify me. Home is a feeling and I want to go there.I am scared.Despite where this is being posted I will not do anything drastic not yet at least. I have been typing this out for over an hour so this is where I will end advice would be appreciated. Lost,Suicidal
22910,22930,I do not think I can face another day at work but its too late for me to call out. Some of my coworkers trigger my anxiety so fucking much and I have started feeling suicidal again. I am in the parking lot at work and I do not know what to do I do not want to go inside Anxiety is killing me,Suicidal

22932,22952,I 15M feel like I have been living the same day every day for the last 4 years. i hate the fact that I had to move out of town because of my mom's addiction to cocaine. I hate the fact that my dad overestimated me so much when I came to live with him. i hate the fact that now he thinks I am useless. I hate the fact that now I am really useless I have time and energy but I do not use either because I am lazy and I stay all day either on the PC or in bed not wanting to do anything I need to change the way I I live but I also do not have the courage to change. I always end up doing shit when I try to be more outgoing and I always give up after saying I am going to change. I have time and i do not use it. I am a bad person who wanted to have a worse life just so I could justify myself for being the way I am. I am disgusted with myself and instead of growing as a person I am considering continuing to do nothing until I am 18 and when the responsibilities start to show up I run away as usual jumping from the 15th floor of a building or something like that. or I kill myself now there is nothing stopping me now besides about 4 or 5 people. it is just that as the lazy disgusting person that I am I am not really into living in a third world country earning a minimum wage a month that does not quite cover my basic expenses and that in the best case I probably would not even get a job. I cannot talk to people normally I would get anxious and just freeze at a job interview i feel like I have been living the same day every day for the last 4 years.,Suicidal
22935,22955,I want to jump out of window. I want to cut my ears of so I do not hear anything. I do not want to see anything. I just cannot breath. Someone say a resson to survive please?,Suicidal
22950,22970,The last time I tried to kill myself was a little over six months ago. Since then I have not spoken to any of my friends. None of them have bothered to check on me. Friends I guess I do not even know what that means but I do know now that I do not matter. I used to think it was disrespectful for people to wait until you are dead to finally show up and act like you were some valuable part of their life. Everyone dresses nice. They talk about how great you were. there is comforting and crying rather they really liked you or not. But to actually get to see that no one would even come to your funeral that hurts. That really hurts. I woke up the next day still alive and no one cared. And the day after that still alone. Too embarrassed to reach out for help. The days passed and the people that were most important to me had not reached out to me either. I was essentially dead. I stopped going to work. I cannot face anyone that might know what I tried to do. Again. Over six months have passed. My girlfriend either does not know what happened or has pretended not to. I cannot talk to her about it. She does not understand any kind of depression. She thinks you just turn it off and decide to be happy. Well she is happier now anyway. She never likes my friends. She does not want me to have anyone else. it is been very noticable these past months how much happier she is since I have not spoken to anyone.So I fake it. I pretend I am fine. We cook the meals. We say the I love yous. We do the road trips. The weeks go on and I am alone. I hide the pain. I suppress the anger. I distract my self with little projects that I do not even care about. And I drink a lot. It dulls the constant anxiety. I have to drink when we go hang out with her friends to bury the hatred I feel that she gets to enjoy the company of the people she chooses. So I keep drinking and pretend I do not want to scream. I pretend that I am not jealous of every other person I see. I drink even more to forget how embarrassed I am just being me so I can try to act like I belong there when I know I do not. I do not belong here. I am just waiting. Always hoping something else will accomplish the task that I have been incapable of. Just waiting to die. And it is not even so much that I want to die as it is that I sure as hell do not want to go on living. So I just keep waiting lying to everyone and pretending I am fine. there is no purpose in posting this. I just needed to put it out there. I need to vent.,Suicidal
22957,22977,I am exhausted. every day i open my eyes and feel a pit of anxiety open in my chest disappointed that i woke up again. i just do not want to do this anymore. struggling,Suicidal

23003,23023,But you gems already know that do not you.My mind is in a bad place. The kind only drugs can quickly relieve you from. I do not want drugs but I certainly understand why people use them.it is an excruciating pain. You cannot see it. You probably know it though. Your head is as of someone is squeezing it together. There might be a ton of bricks on each shoulder. there is a lump on your insides but Everything feel so hollow. And I am just so unbearably cold. I can barely sit up. there is no energy with my typing. Just being here hurts so fucking much. I almost want to will myself to death. I read you can do that. would not that be an inconvenience.Scratching my skin open just to distract myself would be nice to. do not want to upset though do we.I just want it to be over. I want it to be over. there is no point to my life or being here. I think I should have died a long time ago. Someone on the universe fucked up..to keep me here want me here for what. I have not felt anything remotely close to happiness since I can remember years. I truly lost the desire to live strive for anything so long ago You made it all so much worse you know. Why tell you. You will not care you will get over it. I do not want to be stopped. I could drive to your house to say bye. But I will not be because I know I do not matter to you. I wish you never were a part of my life.I would tell you all how I would do it but is not discussing methods bad. I cannot right now anyway. Though admiteddly that has become markedly less relevant over the years. Let someone else clean up. Or let them all meet each other and spout lies about me and how bad they feel while pilfering my things. Lol.I do not believe I will make it to work today. It is not time for sleeping forever yet. A sleeping pill too many I certainly hope knocks me out soon though. Some damage causes irreparable harm. A sorry heartfelt not felt what is the fucking difference does not fix it.,Suicidal
23005,23025,I am fucking doneI am killing myself at 1111.I have been cyber bullied for 3 years and bullied since kindergarten.I have been neglected and yet nobody does anything about it.I have had multiple conversations with people who try to help me even tho they do nothing.Saying its going to be ok is not comforting.I just want to be happy.Maybe my parents be happy to finally see I am gone at the time I came into this worldgoodbye.I love you all Fuck life,Suicidal
23045,23065,For starters I have Borderline Personality Disorder a condition that makes me emotionally unstable and amplifies negative emotions tenfold it is the hardest personality disorder to live with and the least likely to be taken seriously by others. Look it up it is actually quite sad. Add to that a debilitating addiction to Crystal meth a drug that is statistically harder to quit than heroin. Meth like Borderline Personality carries a heavy stigma one that opioid addicts and even crackheads are not given as much. The withdrawal comes with crippling physical fatigue and weakness making everything exhausting. But worst of all is a feeling of intolerable depression that comes from nowhere a depression like nothing you have ever felt before. I dread the amplification of that depression from my BPD and thus I stay high for weeks until I am broke. When I first wake up detoxing I feel the depression spread through me and my thoughts are consumed with darkness. To top it off I am about to be homeless again in a matter of weeks and I am terrified absolutely terrified of living outdoors in this constant extreme humidity in the middle of summer. So to recap I have withdrawals that because intolerable depression a personality disorder that amplifies negative emotions and I am going to be homeless in nonstop summer heat. BPD is the.worsr personality disorder and carries the worst stigma of its kind.Meth is the worst drug and carries the worst stigma of its kindHomeless people are so stigmatized they are treated like scum like second class citizens. So in conclusion I am about to experience the worst depression possible and be treated with nothing but cruelty and apathy. Oh and I am very likely to die a slow death from heat stroke as people step over me and let it happen because they hate me.I have enough fentanyl in my possession to kill 10 people a needle and a fate so grim I cannot even.wrap my head around it. All I think about is suicide. No one would care even though my situation is objectively worse than everyone else's and I know I deserve the utmost sympathy I am the least likely to receive it.So why should not I kill myself? Where to begin...,Suicidal
23073,23093,I cannot take living this life anymore. I am a 34 year old male and I cannot take this loneliness anymore. Every woman I meet just lies to me and uses me then tosses me away. All I have ever wanted in life is to get married and have a family to have someone to love who will love me. But it is impossible for any woman to have feelings of love for me. I cannot take this anymore. I spend every day of my life resisting the urge to commit suicide. I drive down the street and vision myself crashing into oncoming traffic at 90 mph. I have dreams of stepping in front of a train or other fatal things every night. But I have to remain tethered to this existence because my disabled mother needs me. I have begun harming myself physically.My entire life has been torment. From the ages of 3 to 16 I was physically beat by people threatened of being killed daily then from 18 to now I am emotionally and mentally abused by women who I try to date. I do not have the strength to keep doing this. Why is it too much to ask to find someone to love me? I know I am extremely ugly but I have good qualities. I am caring loving I can cook I always put others before myself. Why is there no one alive who cares about anything beyond the physical? There is no hope in the darkness,Suicidal

23119,23139,I got heavily exposed to some really toxic mold about five years ago while working as a scuba instructor. There was a thin layer of it on the interior of my scuba regulator and I was breathing off of that regulator for about 4 hours a day for 2 months underwater and as a result of that my mental health totally collapsed in about 7 weeks flat Once I had figured out what was going on it was too late I had been severely poisoned I have been trying to get my mental health back ever since A couple of years ago I developed sudden onset severe debilitating tinnitus with my hearing test coming back as normal. Every time I talk to a doctor about this one of two things happens and they either say that is impossible and kill the issue or they do not know how to help or who to refer me to and kill the issue I have done a lot of my own research and have had some success controlling symptoms with various supplements but I need back up on this and there just is none. I have tried bringing what I have done and the limited success that I have had to my health care providers attention on multiple occasions and they have nothing worthwhile to say Its always they do not know what to do and do not know who to refer me to and then the issue dies once again The research and the understanding just is not there yet for this kind of issue To date my health insurer refuses to acknowledge or entertain this issue. And insists all symptoms are mental health related only but also refuse to provide adequate testing to prove otherwise yes or no.I was recently able to push for a head MRI and it showed something interesting in that it showedflagged for chronic paranasal sinus disease. This was interesting since previously my health insurer refused to authorize any test that would show such a condition and obviously what the MRI technician saw on the MRI was bad enough that it warranted calling the inflammation chronic with no other scan to compare it to. I do not have a clogged or stuffed nose. It is looking like I may have haddo have a phantom cyclical fungal infection in my sinuses for half a decade now that is causing my tinnitus and mental health problems. I asked my health insurer for a CT scan to see the extent of the problem and a biopsy culture to see what is causing the problem both were immediately denied. I am currently fighting them on that. What is the point on giving someone an MRI if you plan on just ignoring the results?... If a CT scan and a biopsy culture shows a chronic fungal infection that is causing the inflammation my tinnitus and my mental health problems might be treatable with the right combination of antifungals and steroids to treat the infection and bring down the inflammation. They are refusing to provide treatment by not providing the testing to see what treatment would help.I have been currently experience long term passive suicidal and or mutilation impulse on a near daily bases as a result of my current situation for seemingly no other reason. My health insurer is well aware of this and are celebrating since they finally provided a single individual therapy session and they feel that a single therapy session a month is adequate treatment for the situation that I am currently facing. I have been so destroyed by this situation that I am unemployed living with family and as result of making so little income last year I just switched over to state medical insurance. Since I am now on state insurance my copays are zero and I am pretty sure that I can weaponize the current laws against my health insurer.These days I am passively suicidal on basically a daily basis but not actively suicidal. The current rules state that I am supposed to go to emergency if I am passively suicidal. I do not because I think that it is a waste of my time since there is no treatment there but I think that I might start going. Since if I start showing up to my health insurers emergency with passive suicidal thought on a regular basis they are required by law to check me in and evaluate me every time but cannot hold me unless I pose an immediate threat to myself or others. This will bill the state a few thousand dollars each time this happens and will only be a time inconvenience to me At what point will the state stand up and take notice? Fifty thousand dollars of the tax payers money wasted a hundred thousand five hundred thousand? There has to be a threshold here where they start asking what the hell is going on here. I doubt they will blame the suicidal guy that is just trying not to die by suicide. Then I can leak the story to the media and let the story snowball from there. The negative publicity for health insurer may be very significant. Let me know what you think? I am thinking about weaponizing the current laws against my health insurer to get adequate testing and treatment Let me know what you think?,Suicidal

23164,23184,it is my birthday next Monday.Last September I was in the psych ward under suicide watch after 6 months of activepassive suicidal ideation. I have bipolar 2 CPTSD childhood sexual abuse in recovery from an eating disorder treatment resistant depression Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures since all my tests have come out non conclusive a history of alcoholism and addiction in my family as well as a current substance use disorder and situational trauma from immigration cheating and divorce.I have worked as a caregiver in treatment facilities as an advocate in emergency shelters in mental health clinics in domestic violence shelters and as a case manager in several non profits. I have been on the other side of the line when people call while being suicidal while being in crisis while being in danger when they ask for help.I have gone through countless trainings about suicide prevention de escalation crisis management active listening assessing and determining care and ultimately how to help someone in the best way I can when they need someone that can listen to them.Today I went to a pawn shop picked a handgun and put my name down for the wait list for the background check. The clerk said it will be a week for the background check to clear wait times increased since the pandemic started it was a day or two before that and then I will be able to pick up the handgun and go about my day.it is my first gun no one seemed concerned about my lack of knowledge about guns how I was fumbling and shaking while checking the gun out and how I was so fixated on the wait time and kept asking if there was any way to get it sooner.I have researched on what would be the best way to do this. I have come up with 3 options. 1. Opiates I am trying to find a way to get Opiates even though I have never used them I know a couple people that have overdosed and some of them have come back and said it is quick and painless. If I do not get them by Monday I will move on to the next option. 2. Hanging I have practiced short suspension I have tried it and chickened out every single time I start to close my eyes. The moments of consciousness while sitting with the rope on my neck have scared me but I know how to do it. If the other options do not work out I will try again.3. Gun back home in my country guns were something I had never touched and only had seen people in the military or in the war use. When I moved to the US I landed in a state that is very passionate about guns I still refused to touch them. It was not until 2 years ago that I shot my first gun in range while my whole body was shaking. Even though I had been in the hospital for suicidal ideation a couple months later my partner became a gun enthusiast and started buying guns. He keeps them in a safe and makes sure I cannot access them EXCEPT when we go shooting together a few months after the hospital I went from not being able to hear or see guns to going shooting regularly. I became more comfortable holding them feeling them seeing them using them. My partner saw this as a sign of progress as a sign of recovery. I see this as progress as well to take my own life.I have been on and off medications for the last 9 years anyone with bipolar knows all the cocktails and the back and forth of adjusting adding removing the promises of let us just wait until you are in the right doseetc.The last cocktail was lithium Lamictal and abilify. Right now we settled on being off lithium after months of begging to be off of it because I was feeling like a zombie and move to prozac and keep the highest dose. of Lamictal. Well at this point this is just rambling. But the point of all of this is to say I know what I am talking about I know about treatment I know about prevention and warning signs I know about safety plans I know about inpatient about outpatient about support networks and I know how hard it is to care for someone that is depressed and suicidal. I know what we have all been told that should be done.And yet whatever happens next week I will either hang myself overdose or shoot myself in the head. I would planned to drive alone on my birthday go to ny favorite spot watch the sunset and pull the trigger but the wait time for the background check caught me off guard. I will probably do the same if I manage to score the opiates. Id rather not to hang myself at home I have tried and my dogs always lay next to me and I back out but it will be the last resort if all else fails.I have not finished writing all the notes for everyone but I will get it done before the weekend ends. I have written a list of what should happen to my belongings my dogs my burial and all the contact information for family work and friends.I am having a big party on Saturday for my birthday and will see almost all my friends. it will be really nice to see everyone before leaving. My partner has said he is burntout that it is been a year of making sure I keep living but he is also resentful that all the effort he is put to make sure I am safe and happy has only given me the freedom to be reckless and self destructive. I know he is tired but he will not have to deal with me for much longer.After a year of asking people to keep me company to talk to me and call me when I have been in crisis a year of asking for help constantly I think I am done. I have not told anyone about my plans. I have spent my days cleaning and organizing throwing away things and making sure it will not be so hard to clear out my place after I am gone.So far the only big red flag that shows I will commit suicide is that I was emotionless when I broke the news I would gotten fired from a job I had really wanted and had fought to get all I said was that it was okay and I knew it was my fault anyways oh well.Well after all this rambling do you think I am missing something? Do you think I should say something else to someone? Maybe I am missing something I should do before I go?Thank you for reading peace and love! Plan of action. Loose ends rationale and means,Suicidal
23165,23185,I only have three things keeping me here and one of them is a fucking band. I feel so disconnected from my body and I deal with harrasment daily. One of the few things keeping me here is a trip to visit my friends. What happens once I get that? My schedule is fucked I have no motivation I am talked over by the people I love I do not have anyone to relate to and i hate burdening my people with my problems. it is so hard for me to do things even just getting out of bed. I wish I had some sort of diagnosis at least. How do I keep going?,Suicidal
23168,23188,Twice in a row I have not been able to make my fianc cum during sex. It seems like 2550 of the time I cannot make him cum because I get too wet. He swears he does not need to cum during sex to enjoy it and showers me with love but I do not believe him and I am afraid he is going to cheat on me or leave me because I apparently suck at sex. I do not even enjoy sex anymore it gives me anxiety. I am a worthless human being and I should just put myself 6 feet under. I have plenty of tylenol and naproxen to overdose on maybe I will do that. Any suggestions? I cannot please my fianc I might as well kill myself,Suicidal
23180,23200,I have started a new job after being unemployed for 6 months but its going horribly. I do not talk at all even though everyone else is normal and socializes i just stand there looking lost and stupid. Everytime i wake up i absolutely hate going into work because of how awkward i am.

Fucking hate whenever things seem to get better Ill just remember something. Must of been here however many times but hope of change kept me going but now I think I realise that even if the ideal happens it will not change anything and Ill still want to die so ITS COMING HOME,Suicidal
23333,23353,Life is not fair. People say it gets better but it does not. My heart goes out to all of you here living terrible lives of constant pain without hope.I will end my misery soon for an illness I have been battling for 2 years without signs of recovery.

23393,23413,HiI am a 28 year old she will of a man from the UK suffering with severe depression and most likely an undiagnosed mental illness!I entered such a dark corner of my mind that I tried to take my own life in 2016 and I lost my bottle at the very last moment now I am what I call stuck alive.I saw the potential effects that my suicide would have had everyone told me how upset they were and how distraught they would be if i died.I also remember being distraught distraught that I had lost my bottle and been saved distraught that I had woken up in the nightmare I tried to escape from.Ever since that day I have been stuck alive too depressed and suicidal to achieve anything believe anything want anything feel anything... Angry at myself and everyone else that I am not dead and do not have the bottle to end it my step brother died a couple of years ago from an accidental recreational drug overdose and I wished it was me he was only 18! Why is the world so cruel?This of course highlighted again how devastating a death in the family would be.Each day that passes I slip deeper and deeper into despair I know this is happening I just cannot stop it meanwhile my partner of 13 years has become a fulltime alcoholic that blames me for every problem she has within herself I am openminded but something tells me if she left me she would quickly discover these kind of problems are rampant within people our age.I am struggling to see the point anymore prepandemic I was doing my dream job still wanted to kill myself but found myself being too busy to even think about it that much... It was more of an inconvenient intrusive thought at that stage.We scraped our way through doing any work that was available being mistreated at each company of course I fear the mental scars that my partner and I now both have on top of our preexisting issues is just too much to return to normality.She is pressuring me to have a child people our age tend to feel like we are failing due to seeing previous generations achieve things that are 10x harder for us to facilitate like providing security and stability for a child!I am receiving professional help albeit very slowly via the NHS but the poor buggers are overrun as usual and things do not move quickly at all I am wondering if other people can relate to this permanent lust for what is quite simply a smidge of happiness I have never felt joy or pride or love and that is all I have ever wanted I do not need money I just want fulfillment I just want to wake up in the morning with no immediate desire to die!Let me know if you relate I seem to feel better hearing other people relate to me otherwise I convince myself I am the problem! Maybe I am??? I Am Dead,Suicidal
23437,23457,I 15F was sexually assaulted when i was 10 and 13 by the same cousin. My parents are abusive fucks. My brothers tried killing me more than once and has been touching me lately. My uncle will not stop touching me either. I have tried killing myself before. I am just so done with all these thoughts in my head. Like its all your fault you went into that closet with him. you should have told him to stop. maybe i deserve getting beaten like this. i do not know what to do and i want to die so badly and I am so tired of wanting to die I am so tired of all the thoughts in my head,Suicidal
23450,23470,I want to die because I am lonely and have no one to cuddle with me. I feel like everyone will just reject me. I am just a 26 year old loser. No one will ever love me. I am lonely and angry and tired of it,Suicidal

I do not need help or sympathy I just want to help others like me if you are suffering and need someone to talk to which I imagine you are if you are reading this please let me know I am always happy to help I do not care who you are but I care about you and I am here for you ,Suicidal
23520,23540,I have been so numb for the last two days. All I do is sleep and eat because I am pregnant and I do not want my kid to die. But in a few months I can give her up and end it. Id be a terrible mom. I just wish I knew this all sooner. I was so dumb for believing otherwise. I feel dead already,Suicidal

23558,23578,Goodbye guys. Love you I am sorry I was not enough,Suicidal
23574,23594,I am only 20 and I feel like I failed lifes purpose. I had an opportunity to do something that could have changed my life but I did not because I am a fucking PUSSY. Now I have to deal with the guilt and I have to find another purpose for myself. I hate how I overthink every decision that comes my way why cannot I just fucking smarten up and get out of my own head? I feel like the only way to cope with my misery is through drugs and alcohol I just cannot keep living like this without some vice to give me relief. I fucking failed my lifes purpose,Suicidal
23586,23606,I have no idea what I am doing with my life.These day I fell like i am nothing i do not matter at all and honestly I really want to kill myself everyday. I cannot even hold a knife without thinking about shoving that shit in my chest.My mom just scream around and complains about everything my dad is always angry my sister is a egomaniac who thinks i am a piece of crap. Everybody on my life just seem to hate me and i just do not see why i should not do it. I do not know what I am saying.,Suicidal
23588,23608,Very soon I am going to have about 2 hours alone to myself. I think that is as good a time as any to die. I need to stop procrastinating and crying wolf every time I want to die. Now its time to act. I guess this would be goodbye I might die today if I get the courage,Suicidal
23625,23645,I cannot move out of my abusive home...have no money. cannot get another job...I am nearly incompetent at this point due to depression and anxiety. I work 2 days a week and cannot even handle it..I am at work right now crying my eyes out in the bathroom because my coworker triggered me. I cannot fucking take it living like this. I want to die because I am surrounded by toxic people and I am also in physical pain everyday on top of my emotional pain,Suicidal
23628,23648,Just want someone to listen for a while. May I speak to someone?..,Suicidal
23629,23649,I cannot be in the lives of the people I care about without hurting them. At the same time cutting ties with them might hurt them too. I just wish I were not such a horrible person. I wish so much that I were not. But I have spent years in a severely depressed state and every time I try to escape it I hurt someone. I become a person that hurts people. That must just be who I am. And I cannot put the burden of a depressive me on anyone else anymore. I just cannot.I think I am going to make it look like an accident so it is sad but not suicide sad. My friend committed suicide a few years ago and I cannot do that to anyone. I just cannot. So accident it is. Or maybe I could get into a drug or something. I do not have insurance so no rehab so it would basically be a death sentence on its own right? And that way no one could blame themselves. Every time I try to hate myself a little less I become a horrible person and hurt someone I care about unintentionally. After trying again and again I have come to the conclusion that I am a bad person. I have to find a way to die.,Suicidal
23656,23676,it is not obvious that to live is the way. the grand finale,Suicidal
23657,23677,I think we can all agree that 2020 was a crappy year then again what year is not crappy 2021 is no different but 2020 was definitely crappier than most. However for me it was the most relatively stable time in YEARS. It was by no means perfect and I still wanted to die but most of the time I actually looked forward to the next day whereas now I get a panic attack every time I wake up realizing that I did not die in my sleep. Back in 2020 I did not go to school much because of corona so I had less school stress. My relationships with others were good and I always daydreamed of a perfect future. let us fast forward to now. I hardly get any sleep or relaxation due to the stupid summer classes and tuitions she puts me in. I have either pushed everyone I love away because that is the asshole I am or they pushed me away. Everyone who told me they cared for me probably do not give two shits about me now. My days are filled with worry depression and anxiety with some bursts of positive energy that only come from sugar and caffeine which leave me even more tired and depressed after. Most of my time is spent in nostalgia mostly for my childhood when my only worries were when my favorite cartoons would come on and the occasional bully however sometimes I am nostalgic for things that happened a few months or even a few days ago because I am starting to realize how quickly time passes us by. To make things worse my school starts in a few years so more depression and anxiety is on its way. And in a few years I will be an adult so I will get Depression Anxiety and All the Other Negative Emotions Special Edition Now with Bills and Student Loans!I should have killed myself back in 2020. I should not have waited for my life to deteriorate more. If I killed myself when things were relatively good I would have gotten a happy ending rather than the painful memories flashing before my eyes if I killed myself now. Of course I was too scared back then and I am too scared even now.You know if there is one thing that society's right about it is that there is a lesson to be learnt from almost every situation. I would not say that going through all this shit was worth the lesson but I did learn that the world and society will always be fucked up greedy assholes that things will never get better that getting too attached to people too quickly is a deathtrap because 99.9 of people who say they care about you will backstab you that the saying it is better to have loved and lost than to not have loved at all is bullshit that only people society deems to be 'mentally healthy' and have not seen true pain hate the idea of death. People like you and me and everyone on this subreddit have been through shit that made us realize that death is probably the best part of life. Sure some of us might fear death and yeah it is NEVER okay to encourage someone to take their life but I have learnt not to hate death and embrace and love the fact that even if not now it will come eventually. I should have killed myself when things were relatively good,Suicidal
23669,23689,could not find my dads gun in the morning but the chain hanging my punching bag looking real enticing who would like to talk me out of killing myself,Suicidal
23674,23694,Tried several over last few years and has not helped and in fact I feel much worse as time goes on. does not help that my mother constantly berates me and diminishes m issues despite the fact her own father killed himself What exactly is one supposed to do if therapy has not helped whatsoever and you only feel more and more suicidal every week?,Suicidal
23683,23703,there is this future I dream of that Id really like to happen for me. maybe its dumb to hold on for something that could possibly never happen but I want to grow and bloom with this person. I have decided recovering and getting better with this person is what I want to do. I will try to do it and I hope they try for me too.sn will always be an option for me though. and just an hour ago I was almost set on hanging recovering will be so hardI wish everyone well. I am sorry life has brought us to this point but I am rooting for all of us always.hugs. I have decided to stay for now.,Suicidal
23689,23709,I am tired of trying for other people. I do not care about getting better because I do not want to be alive at all. Its making me hate the people around me every time they say they need me around or something of the sorts. I do not fucking care if I am selfish. I did not choose to be here and now I am forced to be alive and its bullshit.WHY is it so fucking hard to just be able to Kill myself. I deserve to have that right over my body and my life and to not have people try to stop me. I hope to god I can figure it out today and that this is my last day here. I am tired.,Suicidal
23732,23752,I am choosing to extend it till tomorrow since I have to help my family sign some documents regarding financial matters. Doing so will allow them to get some money in their hands. If I die now they will not get this cash they have been waiting for in over 10 years. The one decent thing I can do for them before I goAnyways I have borderline personality disorder. If you have this disorder I think you can clearly understand why I am done with it. This disorder has effectively ruined my life. Through in a bunch of continuous trauma and you have a mentally destroyed person who cannot take anymore pain. Yesterday was yet again another bad relapse. I ended up hurting a frined and they blocked me. I reached out to our mutual friends but I think the damage is now done. I am fucking tired of these suicidal relapses mistakes and hurtful abusive behavior. There is a reason we have a bad rep and are known as abusers. Sad to say it exists for a reason. I am done. Not only will I not be suffering anymore pain I will not live with hurting people anymore as well. I cannot take this shit. Hey maybe some people can live with BPD. Are willing to deal with the rollercoaster of pain and life and make it work. Cool. But I realized I should have given up a long time ago Tomorrow after signing the documents I will commit suicide. I will walk to a bridge not too far from where I live and jump. This will be over. I am not doing this shit anymore. Every time I decided to live and get better moments like yesterday remind me that I am not cut out for life. I should have listened to myself at 13. When my mother was abusing me I told myself I have to kill myself to escape. But I thought about hope. Hope? The fuck is that. Life raped me in the ass every year after that. did not care about me and nothing I did to help myself mattered either. Still got abused sexually assaulted years later and hurt in other ways by other people. So suffice to say I am done. I will send people I know suicide letters and send them. Turn off all my electronics and then die. The end. I am not living with this disorder. I will bridge jump tomorrow,Suicidal
23748,23768,I do not know what to do with myself anymore. I am in therapy and I am on medication but the medication is not working and the therapy is moving so slowly but that is my fault. I always shut down I have not had the courage to mention anything on my mind because I feel so fucking anxious and the one time I did mention I felt suicidal I nearly had a panic attack and just asked to go home. Maybe that was a mistake maybe I should have gone inpatient I do not know. I probably should have because I honestly just wish I was dead I wish I could escape from this prison which is life and not be trapped here for another 80 fucking years. I do not have any hobbies I can fall back on I do not have anyone in my life really and the only family member I talk to has a mentality of if they are going to kill themselves they will do it I cannot stop them so I do not know whether to confide in them. I just feel so trapped. Its getting bad but I do not even fucking know how to die. I am just stuck. Life feels like a prison,Suicidal
23810,23830,In May my biological mum jumped in front of a train. We had never really gotten along. I was raised in the foster system due to her drug issues but yknow she was still my mum. Brought me into this world yknow. Before she passed she kept messaging me to call her she wanted to talk. I just kept ignoring her. Now i keep thinking what if i had just replied? Maybe she would still be here. Almost exactly a year earlier my foster mum passed away due to lung cancer. She was the lady that raised me but a year earlier i had left her home because we were not getting along. She kept calling and i ignored her too. Had just started a new job when i got the phone call from my foster sister that she had passed. I was not there for her to help her in her last daysI cannot look in mirrors anymore. Every time i see myself i just get so disgusted. When i look in the mirror i see the man that let both his mums die. God i just want to die man. The guilt is suffocating. I cannot talk to anyone about this. I cannot cry in front of my families. I do not deserve that privilege. I have no honour. I might as well. My Mum recently committed suicide. One of the first thoughts i had was she beat me to it,Suicidal
23815,23835,The universe keeps flipping the coin and It seems like I am always on the wrong side of that coin while I continue living miserably as others reap the rewards of my misery. Every step I take in the right direction takes me 20 steps back and every step I take in the wrong direction takes me 40 steps back as I lead the path to my own destruction. I used to be a firm believer of the idea that working hard will always have a positive outcome of success and I am yet to reap the rewards of my hard labor. Its seems like I will never catch a break no one really cares about me and why should they. I got no family no friends and nothing to live for. what is even more heartbreaking is I am still young and I believe I have true potential but I am just tired of fighting and pushing. I always wonder and ask myself why me and come to the conclusion that I have no one to blame but myself. As life goes on it keeps getting harder and harder and the simple things that used to be of the norm in my life are becoming extremely difficult to acquire. People usually say be grateful that your alive but I just want to die in peace. I am on the neverending path of misfortune and hate myself and everyone around me. The wrong side of the coin.,Suicidal
23822,23842,I am almost certain that nobody cares if you are depressed or going through a lot until you die and sometimes they do not even care if you die. People are ignorant pieces of shit and this life is just going for the worst.Poverty shitty governments hard expensive and useless education.I do not know when are we going to find happiness and peace aside from death.Do I have to live another 60 years so people do not get sad? what about me? I am sad too why do I have to think and care about other people before thinking about me?These people have friends and family who love them. The death of a failure will not affect their lives anyway so why do I have to worry.For the past 6 years I have been suffering from traumatic experiences and shitty religion brainwashed family.Like seriously the first thing my parents said after I asked them what do they think about suicide is how I will get fucked up in the afterlife because suicide is haram sin. Nobody cares,Suicidal
23852,23872,I because be in room full of family and friends and I still feel alone. I am tried of feeling alone I give my heart to people for them to hurt me.I am tried of feeling alone and tried of trying to stay alive I am tried of feeling alone,Suicidal

23897,23917,Thoughts of suicide are becoming more frequent being angry hopeless and sad all the time seems futile but there does not seem to be anyway to change it. How does this end I am so sick of struggling through every day,Suicidal
23900,23920,I am tired. I cannot achieve any of the things I want to and even if I achieve something it does not help shit. I have no social life no one to speak to and school makes me want to kms even more. I feel so lonely all the time but my social anxiety is keeping me from making friends. I am still scared to do it but i know that it is the only option for me. wonder if anyone feels the same wasted the best years of my life being depressed and running away from my problems,Suicidal
23906,23926,How am I supposed to explicate something so deep in my brain and thoughts in another language?The solution is to be laconic and concise I do not find a meaning to life and I do not want to have anything to do with it.I try so hard really. I am studying to get into university working out eating healthy trying to be useful to society by minding my own business and be kind.But it does not work. there is nothing. Nothing. I wake up every morning with the same question why am I doing this? what is forcing me to endure this for years and years? A future shitty job to the yoke of someone else that has no respect or care for my person a potential partner that could never fulfill the intrinsic loneliness of a human being with the only goal to comply with the selfish gene and carry out our biological function. Then what am I left to bet if my darwinian fitness is good?Funny enough getting old and weak is the only thing that I accept. But the chapters in the middle of the novel scare me.I blame my parents every single day for being compliant with our nature our essence. And I always ask myself what goes through the mind of someone that is experiencing what I am experiencing and decide to procreate nevertheless? I might be exaggerating but I assert to the risk of irritating the majority of you that every human that act like this is a criminal no different from a thief or a killer.Sometimes I am tempted to stop taking my benzos cold turkey to see if a heart attack can solve my problems but who knows . . .If you are still reading sorry. there is no good ending to this convoluted show of words with probably horrible grammar . . . Best of luck to you my friend. How do I deal with anhedonia and existential nihilism daily?,Suicidal
23910,23930,ContextIn 2018 my life was finally looking up. I had busted my ass and got my weight down to a good place I was eating well and I had finally found another job that was... well sort of related to my industry of choice graphic design but I was working in a trophy shop. My boss verbally abused me I quit within a month I went back to junk food I found another job at a tshirt shop where I was paid to steal designs from Amazon literally my boss actually had me do this got fired from that too and the resulting trauma destroyed me. I could not even pick up a pen for a while to draw I was so distraught. My weight ballooned going from 168 to 250. I even tried killing myself for the second time.it is three years later. I busted ass finally got out of the food delivery game the only stable line of work I have known for about a decade and worked my way up to being an HVAC apprentice after working in the warehouse for a year. Now I am out here and the job feels like it is going to hell. I do not see much of a future in this position and this feels like 2018 all over again. I do not think I will survive this again. Yesterday I even formulated a plan ifwhen it all went down.it is not fair. I have busted my ass for the past year. I work out more I sleep... better than I did I am human I have been doing all the usual selfcare bullshit and it is still not enough. I am going to die. I am going to die by my own fucking hand because I am going to lose this job that I worked so hard for. it is not fucking fair. I did everything I was supposed to. it is not fair,Suicidal
23930,23950,Constantly trying to better myself and failing and realizing how stupid incapable and inferior I am. Making bad decissions that seem like good decissions at first but only because I am dumb. Constantly losing to everyone.Like I get it the world needs people like me for others to feel like winners. But it is all just so humiliating. I know I am not supposed to see things as a competition but objectively speaking life at it is very core is nothing but a competition.Sadness anger and derpression are just signs from my brain that I am losing the competition and I am losing it big time. I know what people will tell me. I just have to keep trying my time will come blablabla. But I am so TIRED of trying. I am constantly stressed out so I cannot relax I do not feel like eating. I just want it all to end. None of the good things that ever happend to me are worht what I am feeling now.But I know I am too much of a coward to actually end it. I am too attatched to this world for some reason. So like a bad trip I will just have to sit this out. I hope time goes as fast as everyone says Life is so humiliating,Suicidal

I am scared to go outside in my neighboorhood I am scared to see my friends. it is all my fault. I wanted to harm myself but I was too scared. I hate how much of a coward I am. I hate how much I am not going to care about all this later on and I wish I am never able to find any happiness because of this. I wish I was dead but I am too much of a coward. I am so scared of what will happen because of me. I feel like a huge coward by trying to run away from my problems and not being able to kill myself. it is my fault,Suicidal
24069,24089,Fuck all if I knew. Can anyone tell me what its like to live a life without suicidal thoughts and tendencies?,Suicidal
24108,24128,But i do not want to live at the first place. If i kill myself my religion says i will go to hell because I am not grateful with what God has given me which is life. Now i do not know what to do. I am stuck in the middle of this terrible world that God created.At one point i just want to leave my religion and believe that there is no hell and if we die we just become one with the Earth. It feels fairer that way. But what if hell exists? I do not want to suffer in hereafter too. I am religious and my religion asks me to be thankful God gives us life,Suicidal
24114,24134,I have a supportive family. I used to brag about how lucky I was because my family was close to eachother. I have friends and a best friend and I had a job I put in my two week notice but they gave me an option to come back and a raise yet I have so much emotional stress I cannot live with my self. I am heartbroken because my crush does not like me back I hate myself for mistake of past so many argument with my parents. so many sleepless night for people who would not do the same for me. Is it wrong for me to want to distance myself I do not want to the life I know. I honestly wish I could move somewhere and forget everything just work and sleep no thinking I do not want to think anymore My life is ok,Suicidal
24116,24136,I am scared of the afterlife how do I overcome it? Afterlife,Suicidal
24124,24144,I am thinking about using a couple of charcoal barbecues and sleeping pills and finally having that big sleep. Is there a sub or resource for suicide methods?,Suicidal
24131,24151,Hey I know ur an asshole. Hope there is nothing but a cold blanket around you. Cuntbag. Flaquitachuleta,Suicidal
24196,24216,Do you guys know any forums where people discuss suicide freely? I mean if I want to talk about climbing Mount Everest I do not care about you parroting bullshit that I should not do that because staying home is safer. Same goes if I want to talk about suicide I want to actually talk about it and not about your socially acceptable comforting delusions. So any websites without the BS? Any forums with freedom of speech?,Suicidal
24197,24217,Attempted this morning and need some help back upPlease and thank you Looking for encouragement,Suicidal

24228,24248,Fuck My Life Back to posting here lol,Suicidal
24248,24268,My friend just told me she is moving. To Korea.It was such a weird thought I had to ask why. She said that she was tired of being boring and wanting an interesting CV. It was such a short remark but it reminded me that I never cared about the things you should care about. Since I was around 14yo I saw people my age work for their future. I heard them talk about wanting to pull up their CV. Work jobs to save money. In school we learned how to formulate an application all forgotten knowledge and had to take those job consultation talks.I did not care. Why? I guess it boils down to a general disconnection from the world. Typical story depressed since 6yo first active suicide attempt at 13yo slow therapy at 16yo. Most of my teenhood I did not even think I would have a future. Generally I was devoided of love safety and support by both parents and environment. It was only when I got 18yo I slowly started to... wake...up?I got better. A lil at least. Enrolled in a random university was forced to and am trying to get my own place and job. Actually learn makeup. Make a drivers licence. But shit like this always remind me of what I can never have.Like... when I was 17yo I went to Oxford for the first time. And honestly...I liked it. I bought a book about an Oxford student and loved all the interesting things she said about the school. It made me really want to go there myself but my grades were already done with and terrible.I will never have a chance to go to Oxford now. And people around me just say well that is punishment for not working hard enough. And I would have accepted it if my FUCKING LIFE would not already be punishment enough! I want to live but I do not feel like living. I am only 18yo but I feel like I am already behind everything,Suicidal
24253,24273,Life is just not worth itLike people say killing myself will not end my problems i do not have problems i just have no reason to stick aroundim stacked up on meds and idk how long before I go i feel like I am a failure and existing is not worth it,Suicidal
24255,24275,Fuck man i want to die I am in so much legal shit anytime i try to talk to my parents about how i feel i get bitched at writing a note. i wish i had a gun I am afraid this knife is going to be slow an painful. suicide,Suicidal
24268,24288,I find there to be very little helpful content on this topic beyond so many ads for prevention services. I guess suicide is big biz in America. Be wary of admitting how you feel andor asking for help because if you do you risk being put away and losing custody of your children if you have them. So much a,Suicidal
24269,24289,Or I am. I just do not want people to think I am.I do not think I will. But I am thinking bad thoughts. I am trying to stay positive. I am literally being toyed with. cannot say too much. I cannot say I am going crazy because I have been here long enough. So long I do not know when I was not crazy. I do not know what I want. I am jus tired. Not looking for attention...,Suicidal
24308,24328,My partner had to take the razor blade off of me. cannot help feeling like everyone is lives would be a lot easier if I just fucked off this earth right now Nearly had a self harm relapse after 7 years,Suicidal
24320,24340,I want to kill myself. I want to die so bad Fuck this,Suicidal
24350,24370,My dear friend who I have been with for about a year is going through a lot of shit right now and I have not exactly been helpful. I feel fucking awful over shit I have done and I think they hate me now. I have no reason to live without him so I might as well get it overwith and let him be free of me. I think my friend hates me,Suicidal
24354,24374,I fear death but I crave the release of this life. I pray to whatever nameless god that I can come to accept the beauty of nothingness and that I can die peacefully relieved it will all be over. I am not built for this world I do not want to work I do not want to chase my hopes and dreams I just want tranquility and peace but every waking moment I am just reminded of pain. I wish I can live as a halfling in a pleasant village in a world of magic and wonder I can choose to live a quiet life or one of peril and adventure. I know no pain no sickness only peace and joy and sometimes unpleasant emotions to make the good times better. But my life is constant suffering I fear sharing this with my family because I do not think they would understand and I do not want them to worry or get involved with my feelings and emotions. I do not know what to do and I feel like death is the only solution. I want death. I am 19 a dude and a NEET not employed in education or training. I graduated high school.,Suicidal
24363,24383,I do not know if this sounds stupid but I do not see the point in trying to reach my adult years. The world is so fucked. there is so much warand violence and only the rich and powerful people seen to be getting anywhere in life. I am constantly paralysed by the fears of global warming or natural disasters or nuclear attacks. Apparently the affects of global warming will be irreversible in 7 yearsand nobody seems to careor be doing anything about itso I am going to die soon anyway. I just do not want to be around when it all goes to hell. I cannot see any of the positive things about this planet anymore. I feel incredibly stupid writing thisbecause all these bad things happening are completely out of my control but I just feel hopeless for the futureand like most people on this subreddit I do not even have a good enough reason to go. Have you guys at least got good news about the climate change or pollution problems just so I can try and convince myself that there might still be hope?Idk I just do not see the point,Suicidal
24369,24389,I will try to make this short. I have terrible social anxiety and depression. I am addicted to Xanax but have not used since February. My parents just today found out I will be obtaining more very soon. They do not like this because of the issues its caused when used improperly. we have had a rough few years because of this aspect of things. I abused it and caused a real shit show for everyone. My social anxiety is the reason I have no friends and no real relationships besides my close family. I am non functioning. I need the right dose of a benzo to be functional. In response to finding my plan out my mother cancelled my government subsidized phone plan changed the wifi password and told me I need to be out in a week. My mental health is fucking terrible and I have already wanted to die for a while but have never been willing to go all the way. Now that life is going to be x100 harder than it already is I just cannot continue on. I am currently changing clothes at least a couple times a day due to anxiety sweating. What am I going to do homeless just sit in my own puddle? Life is miserable already. Throw homelessness in and it is complete hell. I am done trying. At soon as I am on the streets I am going to go buy a few fentanyl pills then go into the woods and take a bunch of Xanax and then the fentanyl. it will be like going to sleep. I truly believe I will finally be happy when I am dead. it will be like a weight lifted off my shoulders. going to be homeless I am done,Suicidal
24387,24407,everything has to be done exactly like on the sheet even if its the exact location of one word. and they keep coming to my room every 2 hours without knocking to come in and point out every single thing i did wrong and walk out this is why i want to live alone the only time they speak to me is when they want to say i did something wrong why the fuck am i being asked by my parents to do fucking write a document for them I am on my break and i just want to be left alone,Suicidal
24396,24416,The gun is loaded it would be so easy. So quick. The pain would be gone and I could just sleep forever. I am so scared. Now I am just sitting here mad at myself because I did not do it. do not get it,Suicidal
24411,24431, I took 5 of the zoloft and 4 of the Aripprazole will these by any chance kill me? If i took too much let me know if I should purge,Suicidal
24475,24495,I have decided how I am going to do it. its just a matter of time now i guess. its tiring going back and forth contemplating whether to do it would be just as pointless if not more as just sticking it out n seeing where i end up. just glad i have some sort of plan now finally ..7,Suicidal
24498,24518,This subreddit has made me feel far less alone for the last couple weeks of my life but after all the abuse panic attacks and shit I have had to put with in my life I have finally made the decision to end life. I feel deeply at peace and care free now. there is some irony there is not there? I am going to be overdosing on sleeping pills and alcohol soon whenever I fall into another emotional pit again I just have to write my note and perhaps some music because I have always wanted to write an album. Something like spiderland by slint Farewell every beautiful soul I have had the pleasure of talking to on this subreddit Thank you for everything,Suicidal
24500,24520,It feels like I always mess it up I am so lonely. Barely anyone even wants to be my friend let alone in a relationship A really wonderful guy I have been talking to for a few weeks just blocked me with no warning we were planning on dating. Could someone talk to me about it?,Suicidal
24516,24536,I keep getting this feeling or group of feelings every day at the most it feels like something is squeezing my stomach when I get it. The feeling makes me think things like you are not productive anymore you lazy you love wasting all your time do not you you are never going anywhere with your life you are a walking Todo list. When I hear those things I usually reply I know I have so many problems or I should just kill myself and make the problems go away or I will just curl up into a ball and cry until I think of something to do. The internal pain I get from this is so strong it feels physical the fact that I do not know what this is and how to solve it makes the suicidal thots I am getting even worse. What is this thing and What should I do? this thing keeps lowering my happiness levels and IDK what it is,Suicidal
24527,24547,I wish I was not a coward and commited suicide like ten years ago when I still had these thoughts It sucks. I know very well that suicide is the only solution that can help me and at the same time will help other around me by removing my existence. Yet I am too much of a coward to actually go though with it.,Suicidal
24555,24575,People love and care for me and I know that. And I do not deny it. I just do not want to be alive. I do not want to wake up eat go to work distract myself from the emptiness life truly is. Not just that. I am also psychotically depressed. I do not know who I am anymore when I am not convinced I have to die for some reason and I am the chosen one who has to free myself from my physcial existence. it is as if suicide is something people actually desire they just do not know how freeing it is bc they have an illusion that life is better than death. Also I do not even know who I am. I feel mentally dead. I do not think for myself I do not understand how people make money and survive if it is not a corporate slave job where they have masters who have all the power and say. I have not been in school because I have been in hospitals AT LEAST 2 times a year. So there is no point in getting better bc I am just not going to. I died years ago when I was 13. Mentally first. Then spiritually. Now my physical existence must go. People care and value life and that is the only reason I am not killing myself bc I do not want to shatter their illusion,Suicidal
24596,24616,i was wondering if you could give me some help with this matter...my young cousin is posting some suicidal stuff online and seems to be getting a little dark punk rock vibes only and I am feeling worried about him. i needed help when i was his age because i was severely depressed and did not have any help back then. i used to cut myself and i heard my mom saying that recently he did that too.i do not want to see that happening again in our family and i feel like I am the one to do something about it.any ideas on how to address this? should i talk to him? what should i do? cousin 15m showing suicidal tendencies,Suicidal
24664,24684,The current state of the US's capital system has broken me. I am behind on every bill I have thrust at me. Rent electricity car insurance and general cost of living has fallen behind because of an untimely layoff that completely wrecked every last reserve I have. The stress I am under is too much for me to bear and there is no help for me. I am poor unskilled and a liability that negates all chance of loans. My children are going to suffer because of this and I cannot face the thought of them being thrust into homelessnessfoster care. I do not have anyone to help me. My own parents could not help as they are barely scraping by on 800 a month in disability and food stamps.I need the pain to go away. I have nothing to offer the world except a cold lifeless body.I am sorry boys. Daddy tried. I cannot do this anymore.,Suicidal
24681,24701,every day i pass the same road towards my house and picture the thought of me hanging down the branches with a noose. i wonder how my friends will react seeing my dead body while getting out of school. i know its wrong but the thought of dying seems so nice. i just want to get over with it commit suicide but i cannot risk hurting the people i love. today at school people where making fun of me for being a homo and all i did was go into the bathroom and cut myself i could not even stand up to them. i used to be so strong and proud now I am nothing but a loser i deserve to die. The tree down the road,Suicidal
24725,24745,I feel not good and i have not felt this bad in a long time. if I am honest i do not think I have felt this awful ever. I have been going to therapy for the last 2 years and almost and about a year ago i had a massive month long breakthrough where i just had so much love for life and it was fucking amazing. But ever since then i feel like i have this need found awareness for my feelings and thought patterns that I have never had before. I realised recently that its made it almost impossible for me to be able to connect to my past self? which a lot of people comment on saying like the person i met a year ago is so different to the person i see today etc.But the truth is I long for that blissful obliviousness. I want to be unaware so bad and do not get me wrong i was still extremely unhappy back then but i was not so fucking connected to it like i am now. Right now I am somewhat convinced that I am going to wake up in a differnt reality. i think its because i cannot wrap my head around how much fucking pain i am in atm. I have no friends or family i can talk to and even my boyfriend just cannot quite seem to grasp how completely fucked i feel. I do not feel real at all and I do not understand why I stick around for the people that love me cannot they see how much pain i am in. I am so upset with reality billionaires murder global warming all the fucking animals being killed and their homes taken away just so we can make fucking plastic toys and new clothes. child labor assault etc like how am i supposed to fucking deal with this shit. I also recently had to drop out of art school because my mental health is so bad. i got so stressed out id self harm something I have never done beforeand i did not sleep for days and stopped taking my meds it was pretty brutal. I felt really sad about it for a while because i thought i had found a place where i belong but looking at it now i did not fit in there. i could not afford to keep up with buying new things every week for projects and now i guess i realise its all a load of made up bullshit that cost me 24000. I love art and i know i will continue to make art and i do not need some prestigious bachelor 2 make it I know i just need something in my life to change. i just feel so alone in the way that i am feeling. i long for connection to not only people but to the earth and to myself. anyway I am not sure how these posts work but i have a dr app tomorrow which will hopefully get the ball rolling again. thank you for reading if you have trying to wake up,Suicidal
24748,24768,Every day I wake up every second I continue to breathe and be alive gives my family hope allows them to believe that someday in the future that I am going to get my life together and turn it around because if that is not the case why would I bother sticking around? Why do not I just take the initiative and save everyone the trouble of wondering? This is starting to feel like the last part of my life. Treading Water,Suicidal
24787,24807,I say this all the time but why cannot I ever muster the balls just for once? One no possibly 2 people would somewhat care for me dying for a few days then they would move on. that is it. That simple. But even if I thought this through why cannot I bring myself to kill myself? I am never going to be loved. Never. I have no talent nothing that shows that I am smart or athletic. I am not handsome or tall or likeable too. I am just me. Simple old self loathing pathetic me. Why cannot I kill myself already? 2 people might be bummed out but it probably saves other peoples time after I die not having to meet me to hassle them. I am too much of a hassle for anyone which is why I either do not have friends or they avoid me. Just fucking end it Ill be lucky same as those who would ever meet me. Fucking kill me. I am worthless. I can be replaced. The world is overpopulated anyway. What more is 14 years to a different family? Probably more than me but I am basically nothing. Nothing. Just an empty she will with nothing to show for it. Why cannot I just kill myself?,Suicidal
24796,24816,I have work soon and I cannot function properly and I cannot afford to take the day off. I am so volatile. I am not one to cry in public but I could not even hold out past my last work hour yesterday. I have not cried in years. I am having a slow breakdown maybe. I cannot eat have not slept in days. cannot stand living like this anymore. Had to post it somewhere. I cannot do this today. Not today.,Suicidal
24857,24877,So I guess I am posting this because I feel like someone will read this and be able to maybe help or relate to me. For the past I do not know 8 months I have been in a constant state of self loathing and depression I always get bullied for being overweight and for not doing sports or going out but due to covid I cannot and I always feel like no one wants me and that everyone would be better off without me around. Alot of my so called friends do not do anything to help me or always try say that it is not that bad or it will get better but it does not feel like it will ever change. I just do not know why,Suicidal
24870,24890,you do not recover from rape and these twisted scenes i cannot seem to forget have festered. I am now attracted to a man who has attempted to drug and take advantage of me. I am a product of my past.i was only eight. I am almost an adult now and yet my only attractions are to the worst men in the world. i hate you. destined for failure.,Suicidal
24880,24900,I used to have everything.Friends who always wanted to see me.they disappeared.Had a girl who loved me and I fucked that up.I had plans to start a family.To be better than my parents.I ruined it.All of my friends say all these good things about me.But everyone is close to me end up leaving.On of my friends called me an angel yesterday.I do not feel like one.I have this hole in my chest that I cannot seem to fill anymore.Out of all the things I have lost.I think I deserve this. I am nothing anymore.,Suicidal
24919,24939,its been like this for some years my apathy towards my own life just keeps increasing overtime if i was left to my own devices i woudlnt mind starving to death. i just graduated from highschool and i honestly hate the work mentality of turn your brain off for 30 years and then you can start living again. if my parents told me to off myself i would i hate being a bother to anyone but i also do not particularly care for other people I deeply hate unecessary stuff so going to work just to live another day in which you will work again seems so fucking pointless without a clear goal. I have tried to find things i like and stuff to keep me interested but its all temporary soon enough i forget about it and ill just start thinking about suicide. I am too lazy too keep on living at this point I am basically being kept alive. I just do not care about anything and i do not have anything to look forward to. I do not have a goal nor a reason to keep on living. i do not really want to kill myself but i would not care if i died either i would actually be happy.,Suicidal
24922,24942,there is nothing I know that I can help as hard as I try I always come back to wanting to end it. Why cannot I be someone else. Everything in daily life is too much it screams back to me about how how defective I am. Why do I have to be here. I just want to be taken out already. I hate everything about myself.,Suicidal
24974,24994,I am 16 and I see tons of people my age getting jobs working on high effort projects I am nothing compared to them I cannot even fix my own bed.I try to do big projects but I do not have any motivation despite me having all the ideas. I daydream and do not do anything with it. I do not even think I am human honestly. I wish I was not in this reality. I want to be in the world in my head. Its better there. I cannot do anything.,Suicidal
24976,24996,I have to distract myself if I do not ill think about suicide I know how id do it id go to a parking tower near my house and jump I might try to go somewhere higher so id die for sure I really do not want to suffer that would suck I have tried therapy I hated it I love my family they are really loving and supportive I have friends they are great I really enjoy spending time with them I have heard that you cannot be happy with someone when your not happy by yourself I disagree with this I think that given the right person you could be happier I am just an awkward piece of shit that cannot properly display my emotions I assume I bipolar or something like it my mood changes like the weather I am just tired of feeling shitty I do not know if ill do anything I might just wait a little bit after all I am only 15. Thanks for listening this helped a little. i cannot be with myself,Suicidal
25079,25099,Admittedly I do thank most of you especially the mods for being so great here. This is not my suicide letter not yet anyways but a genuine thank you to all of you. I need to share my appreciate to this community that has let me be so free as to air my grief my anger and my genuine plans and thoughts of suicide and self harm. Without this community I am sure that many of us here would have to bottle all of this up or be involuntarily committed for even uttering the phrase 'I want to die'. You are greatly appreciated each and everyone of you for your contribution to this subreddit. Comfort,Suicidal
25110,25130,No one will talk to me. Even my current partner will not talk to me. When we do they just get mad that I am not doing this or that. I even reached out to my family that I have had to switch to minimal contact with and of course they are the way that they are. I cannot make friends. Everyone leaves. I do not even need to talk about my mental illnesses. I will talk about anything. Literally anything. I feel ostracized by life and I used to have this little beam of hope when I would get like this but it is extinguished. I will never be okay it is been made more than apparent. I am so incredibly isolated it is maddening.,Suicidal
25136,25156,I have been suicidal on and off for 4 years and the only reason i have not gone through with it is because i feel too guilty about how devastated my mom would be. I have been shitty enough already. but lowkey its torture lol. i thought i was getting better but i keep pushing away everyone and at this point i know i deserve to be treated like shit and have no right to get upset or angry. I am sick of feeling and living . again. it happens over and over and over it never ends but i cannot do anything to stop it. idek why I am posting in here i have not left my house in like 4 days and have cut off everyone except my roommate the only thing that is been keeping me alive is guilt,Suicidal
25147,25167,I do not want to die but my family has essentially abandoned me. I essentially either die a painless death while I have the opportunity to or I watch my life fall apart slowly over the next 4 months as everyone is disappointed in me I lose my job I get evicted from my condo my credit score crashes and my mental health deteriorates while all of this goes on. Then I am living in a tent in the woods until I starve or freeze to death. I have autism and ADD and I cannot handle living alone in a city I am unfamiliar with. My parents kicked me out over my autistic outbusts and had me buy a place and will not let me back in. I do not know what to do. Do I live as though I only have a few months left to live and watch as my life falls apart? Or do I run before I see everything fall apart and leave in a halfdecent mental state? Some people say to hold onto the chance that my parents will show pity and let me back in if I am homeless. Part of me thinks that is not happening and so I think I would rather end my life painlessly while I have the chance to. And yes I have done extensive research and it is very easy to have a painless death. There is something you can buy for about 100 where all you do is release it in an enclosed space and within 1 minute you pass out within 5 minutes you die a painless death. Life suffering with autism and add or death,Suicidal
25150,25170,No point leaving all my accounts up mainly for privacy I guess. Not that I am going to know any different but feels like something I should do? Idk I want to scrub my social media in preparation but have no idea where to start,Suicidal
25161,25181,Nega gets bigga All of you all.Kill urself.Ur useless,Suicidal
25173,25193,Title says it all. I am not encouraging this but I feel kind of free in a way. it is like the things I have been struggling over are not such a big deal. I can accept that these issues are not going to keep happening and that the pain I am in is only temporary. Not a life long sentence. I think that everyone has the right to end their own life if they are always in pain. I am disabled and have psychiatric conditions that make life absolutely miserable for me. I feel that no one cares because it is just all of the time. I am a burden on my friends amp family. I feel bad that all of this is going to traumatize them but I just feel like they will move on and not have to deal with all of the trouble that comes with my illnesses. I made a plan and downloaded a really detailed book. I have not felt this kind of relief ever knowing that I will not be suffering like I am for much longer.,Suicidal
25182,25202,I do not have any friends. I am literally alone and by myself all the time after work. My mom is the only one that cares for me and buyscooks me food. I just realized now that I am only staying alive because of her. I do not think I can handle living without her. Keeping friendships is the hardest thing I can do. As much as I want to connect with other people they do not want the same no matter how much I try. I am 32 now and I barely have any hope for a happier life. Life has been brutal and I do not have the strength to stand back up. All I ever wanted was to have good friends and perhaps a family. I do not care about money or power. I do not have it in me to stay strong for long. Thank god my mom is healthy but I think of suicide everyday. I am only staying alive because I do not want to because her any pain.Someone please help me. I do not know what to do. I am going to commit suicide when my mom dies.,Suicidal
25206,25226,My partner is going to leave me. I get abused and push everyone away. Am I just supposed to accept that and continue being in these relationships? I know nothing else. What is a normal relationship? I do not even know now I am trusting these women and their families to tell me. I do not want her to call me names and she does. It hurts me. I do not know how to live like a normal person I was just a kid that wanted love and everyone fucked with me. Now I do not know what the fuck I am doing. I am so lost in this pit. I am never going to escape this. Therapy EMDR I am so scared to live. I am so scared to trust people. I am so damn tired. I feel so hurt for all the people out there that suffered abuse especially as kids. Fuck all the people that hurt us. I just do not want to be here anymore. Nothing makes sense.,Suicidal
25218,25238,After 24 years of suffering the end has come. I have had my struggles with my toxic family and my crippling mental illness. I live with my bitch of a mother at the age of 24 and she is ruined my mental health and she will continue to do so if I do not do anything about it. I have only worked shitty minimum wage jobs and I got to the point where my last job got me to a conclusion if I do not find a better job I am going to kill myself because my life is not going anywhere. But how do I find a job if I have a totally worthless university degree? ampnbspAnd I got this idea why do not I start an online course? I knew IT jobs pay well and I have liked computers ever since I was a kid so I started this FrontEnd course that costed me a fortune basically I am paying for the diploma because the info can easily be found online and from tutorials. Long story short I am doing really badly. it is been one month and I still cannot write a single line of code. Ok I can write it in a literal way but I cannot make it look like anything because I do not understand CSS at all. I have had 3 people try to explain to me CSS but I just do not understand it. Everyone says anyone can code but obviously I am not among everyone. I have always been stupid. Even as a small kid I always did worse in school and I was always the last one to understand everything. Eventually my grades started dropping heavily in high school and then when I went to college I nearly did not graduate. My ability to learn new things has declined every year to the point where I have become a fucking vegetable. I am stupid. I cannot survive. I have no skills for survival. ampnbspAnd this is the end. One month ago I made a post explaining how this programming course was my last attempt at trying to make my life better. I failed. Time to finally give up I am only prolonging my suffering by staying alive. ampnbspThanks to everyone who has supported me. I have to go now. See you on the other side. One month ago I gave myself an ultimatum fail and it is over. Today it is over,Suicidal
25224,25244,I sent her message yesterday and it is more than 24 hours she did not even bother to read my message I had decided it if she will not reply me in 24 hours I will take my life. My message is on delivered for more than 24 hours,Suicidal

25238,25258,I have had a hard life and for years I have tried to use my studying or moving towards a career as a way to keep my mind away from the fact life is miserable.I felt mental health would be worthwhile that would make me happy helping others. But instead after three years I am stressed unhappy and ready to end it.you are expected to care in a system that does not care about it is staff. you are supposed to support patients while having no support yourself. This week I ran into an issue on an understaffed and unsafe unit... Now my lecturer in my final few weeks wants to end it all. While other students have had 30 minute assessments and signed off. I am now having three full days of constant assessing.The fact my career could be other before it is began has left me wondering... What else do I have in life? And the truth is nothing... Life's empty and now all I am is stressed.I am expected to stop people killing themselves while myself being in agreement that life really is not worth continuing. I am a student mental health nurse and I want to end it,Suicidal
25252,25272,after some stuff happened today after cutting myself i decided what if i made a noose and tried to hang my self just to know what it feels like? I have had thoughts about killing myself ever since i was 12 and about a month ago i made a really shitty suicide note but decided to not use it or remake it in the future.I made the noose and put in on my door handle first one i made i did not feel anything so i remade it and i could feel it choking me in the end i chickened out and i will probably try to find another place to carry on with my plans in the future but i was wondering would what i did be considered a suicide attempt? would this be considered a suicide attempt?,Suicidal

25336,25356,I do not know what to do anymore. I am tired...of everything. I am not even sure I am feeling anything anymore. This place sucks. Everything sucks and I have come to this realization that no one actually cares about how anyone feels. No one cares how I feel. No one cares that I am tired and I am trying but I feel like giving up. As much as I am scared to die I want to die. I do not want to be here anymore. I do not want to be here and suffer. I am tired of suffering and the pain. I am sure no one will miss me when I am gone and I will be forgotten. I do not matter. I am nothing. I am tired of being used tired of people pretending to give a shit about me. No one cares. I am tired. I am drained. I hate it here. I am tired,Suicidal
25351,25371,I am trying so fucking hard to not let this shit beat me and consume me but every day it gets harder and harder as I become more and more tired I need someone to love me or I genuinely do not think I am going to make it through to the end of this month I am so alone and I am fighting so hard but I can feel myself slipping Second wind,Suicidal
25365,25385,I destroyed my family with my stupidity not adultry. My wife is rightly leaving. I am the biggest asshole and have unintentionally hurt too many over my years. I do not see social cues.

My ex will be happy. she will be able to bang whichever hunk she wants. she will get everything plus life insurance. they will be set. it is the last thing I can give.I do not have strength to give anything else anymore.

25395,25415,I am so fucking jealous of people with families that actually love each other. i could not feel less distant from mine and i literally live with them. sometimes i hate myself for it and remind myself that when I am older and move out and they are old and dying that I would regret not spending enough time with them .. sometimes i just wished they would die now so i do not need to feel guilty later on .. does that make me a bad person? my mom is bipolar and my most vivid memories of my childhood are visiting her at mental hospitals or watching her have some manic episode. but i love her so much. she is the only reason i am still alive because i know if i would die that she would go completely insane. whenever i mention moving out or college to her she gets so sad and tells me that i cannot leave her .. once i just joked about going somewhere and for the rest of the day she kept on bringing it up and asking me why i said that and that i can never leave her .. i really wonder what it would be like to have a normal mom she does not do anything like a normal mom would. she does not care that I am visibly depressed never eat never go outside etc .. she does not care. i try to tell her so much my doctor told her to call a psychrasict.. but she fucking will not because its too expensive and she thinks I am too young to be sad.. I am 16 ..my dad is the same. i feel like i have to literally slit my wrists till they visibly bleed out or try to kill myself so they feel guilty that they did not pick up on all the signs before. my brother is an asshole and people say that trauma brings siblings closer but i feel like i do not even know him. hes a complete stranger to me. i still care about him though because i feel bad for all the shit my dad put him too .. and i wish he cared about me even a little bit but i know he does not. hes so fucking rude to me and my mom hes physically abusive and just so god damn annoying. i literally have nobody in here and i feel so fucking lonely all the time. i have like 2 friends but our friendship is broken and they have their own families to keep them comfort. i have nothing and no reason to continue living for. i always talk about how much i want to die .. but i can never do it .. i cut but i cannot just kill myself .. i wish i could or i wish a car would hit me or id die some really fast way so it can all be over. the thought of death calms me down and whenever i feel stressed about my future or anything .. i tell myself that I will be dead before than so it does not matter .. i can kill myself and all of this will go away and nothing will matter why did i have to be born into this family,Suicidal
25443,25463,I have so many reasons to live for but damn it is so damn hard too keep going I wake up do the same damn thing every day wake up do my thing all day just excited till it is time to go back to sleep no one else to blame but me for not having anything to do but I do not want to do anything I can barely get the energy to even do things I used to love doing just turning on the TVs so much damn work I am 18 and feel useless as hell not having a job makes me feel so useless but like I said I barely have energy to turn the damn TV on I have literally done the same thing for the past 5 years eat wake up and sleep Sleeps really the only thing I look forward too if I did not have a 2 year old little brother I would not be here rn only thing that keeps me going and honestly if I am still alive in 5 years it will be a miracle I just feel it be so much easier if I was dead like being asleep but damn ik how much it would hurt the people that care about me and my little brother....But I just do not know how much longer i can keep doing this it is just so exhausting waking up Idk how I will be able to get a job if waking up is too much damn work and to top ir all off I am addicted to cutting myself hell yeah life is fucking great ik my life is not even close to being hard compared to other people's but damn I am just tired of life and doing the same thing every day but yet again in too damn lazy to do anything else so who else can I blame but myself....

25532,25552,No emotions except for wanting to lay down and rot away. I feel like a walking corpse,Suicidal
25535,25555,all I have ever done is mentally drain all of my friends by talking abt suicide all the time and i know they are sick of it. nobody wants to keep saving someone out of killing themselves over and over again and i only realized this after my only friend who gave half a shit about me completely ignored me and its all my fault. i wish i could fall asleep forever and not hurt anyone but I am stuck between having nobody that cares about me so i decide killing myself is the best option and having too many people care about me to try and convince me out of it.not to mention i loved this person so much yet I have just been an emotionally draining burden since I have known them. somehow i manage to hurt the only people who even want to be around me. if anything this feeling is something i deserve to happen to me. I am a manipulating selfish piece of shit.,Suicidal
25558,25578,I guess this is my suicide note.So my name is Yasir Hanif. I use the alias Daniel Steel because I have been using it since 2015 and think it is cool. I am Muslim. I am also homosexual. I am 17 years old i was born in 13 September 2003 and I have decided that death is only the last option for me.Life has been pretty fucked up since 2021. I hear people say that 2020 was bad but i had no problem at all during that time and was relatively happy. 2021 was really bad. My life is destroyed. I have nothing left. we are middle class citizens in a 3rd world country and it is awful. I used to live in a foreign country and it was awesome there. its been 6 years now since i moved back. This year was so awful i do not have any reason to live anymore. first i lost a cousin. After that i lost my aunt to covid. one month later i lost my grandma. she died 2 weeks ago.I am a 12th grade student. i wanted to be a gamedev. my father hates my life. i did not tell him that i want to be a gamedev. i just told him i wanted to go in the computer field. he forced me into biology in 9th grade. then he forced me into pre engineering in 11th. i was begging him that i want to study computer but he is not happy about it. he hates my decisions. I hate myself. my father is very controlling. i am honestly glad he works in a foreign country. but he is coming back and he will fuck me up. i do not love my self either. I am 17 and I am only 5'1. I am overweight as well. i am pretty good in school and get very good grades. but my father just fucks me up every time.everyone in my family thinks I am a loser. they tell me I am worthless because i do not play sports or have any friends. they never understand me and often criticize me. they are right in thinking i am disgusting.its taboo to be homo here. when i was 14 i figured i was homo. i was stupid. this kid kept hitting on me. one day before school started he told me to follow him. he took me to the bathrooms and raped me. then he told me that he would tell everyone if i said anything. he told half the class. i was harassed every day in school. after 10th grade his friend threatened me and took me to his house. he would do this every week. i was forced to have sex with him a lot. i never told this to my parents. nobody knows I am homo. i endured that man for 2 years. he left my town a couple of months ago. i cried in the bathroom after that.high school was great. i loved 11th grade and i was so happy. then covid came. still i was fine. then this bullshit happened. i have my final exams in 5 days. and I am going to fail.I have never failed in final exams in my entire life. but this year i will. classes never happened. in the last three months i started to go to a tutor. it was a lockdown here but nobody ever bothers to follow guidelines. but it was not enough. i do not know anything this year. I am not going to get good grades. my father will disown me and throw me out of the house. he will not pay for my college. he is been mentally abusing me so much. he kept telling me that he would not pay for college if i did not get a scholarship. and hes a man of his word. he will not do it.so I have decided on a plan.i know my paper is not going to be great. if by gods miracle it is then i will stay. if not then i will jump off the roof of my house. I have recorded a suicide note on my phone. maybe my parents will see it.i know nothings going to get better. my entire life i longed to have a friend. just becuase I am introverted does not mean i do not want friends. but no one will be my friend. I am just scum and i always will be. my little baby sister is the reason i eat and sleep and live. but i do not want her to have a useless brother. she will have to live with a complete mess that is me. people will mock her for it. i will not let that happen.so I am going to kill myself. if you read this then thank you. do not stop me. i just hope to god that none of my family members ever find this post. i do not want them to be even more disgusted than they already are.bye. My plans,Suicidal
25574,25594,I feel so relieved and at peace now to be able to close my eyes for the last time please understand I have tried to stay more than you all know to my long lost friend maybe I will see you again one day for now goodbye. I know I am selfish i cannot help it I am sorry.,Suicidal
25607,25627,I am so in love with the idea of being loved and loving someone. Having someone who is ready to sacrifice their lives for you... you can go home and spend the best hours of your entire day just being in the same place with this special someone. When I get rejected by people I think that love me I get extremely sad and feel heartbroken and betrayed altough rejecting someone is very OK. I dunno why man I am like this... But since the last few years I have been completely alone and the thought of losing my battle against depression killing myself and naturally dying alone have always haunted me. What can I do to cope a little?sorry if inappropite subreddit. how to cope with extreme loneliness and constant social rejection if I am a hopeless romantic.,Suicidal
25632,25652,Having the significant other you have loved for two years move away is sad enough as it is. However we would already been separated for most of our relationship because her parents hate me for making her gay. So the only place I could even see her was at school. Now I am not going to see her at all. She promised me that we would spend more time together this school year especially after the pandemic and the fact that she spent last year at a CTE school. But she is leaving. I am alone again. This hurts so badly... Why is she always leaving so I never have the chance to see her??? I wish I did not wake up today... My gf is moving away and I feel like dying,Suicidal
25639,25659,so its impossible to overdose on lexapro ssriantidepressant when you are drunk? you cannot do it at all? its not possible at all to overdose on SSRIs mixed to alcohol??,Suicidal
25692,25712,Why is it that no matter how long someone is been suffering or how bad it is for them it is still stigmatized? If your suffering is to the point where you go against basic survival instincts people still think of it as the worst you can do? I mean take my case for example I have had to start over socially more times than I can count and this time I have not spoken to anyone I am not directly related to in over a year so no one would miss me and even if I did meet anyone new they would just be out of my life within a year or two for one reason or another I have not been able to get a job in over a year so once covid relief dries up I will have no income my grades are not good enough to get me into grad school which I need if I am going to have any chance at success in my field so even if I manage to pay for my undergrad I have no future I have no reason to stay alive and no hope that it will get better so why despite all of this am I forced to live another 5060 years in abject misery? would not it actually be kinder to end it early than to drag it out? Why is suicide so immoral?,Suicidal
25728,25748,I am so hopelessly sad. I feel like I am withering away and there is nothing I can do to stop it. I am trying everything. Seeing the doctors taking the medicines talking to the therapists etc. No one can help me and I cannot help myself. I do not know what to do.I do not know how to move forward from trauma. I do not know how to cope with the fact that things happened to me that I did not consent to. I do not know how to live an even seminormal life when I am haunted by these things while I am awake and while I am asleep.I do not know how to get rid of the loneliness when making friends has been repeatedly unsuccessful and being a good partner to anyone is out of the question. I do not know who I am anymore. Everything feels so dark and all of my senses are muted. Those brief moments of happy are becoming fewer and further between and I am breaking.I just do not know and I am so scared of everything including myself. I do not know what to do anymore,Suicidal
25750,25770,I feel as though many people will disagree with me but I know this will be my fate sooner rather then later and I am on my knees. The pain I feel within my core is just to much to push through at this point. I am literally just existing for other peoples sake and I do not even feel they benefit from that either other then feeling good about themselves when they feel like they did the right thing by talking me out of it people do not understand the urge that has taken over my core the only thing that is stopping me is pain. And I am just trying to figure out how to get past that point. I lost my love. He did what I plan to. I just cannot see myself without him in this life. I just want to be in his space and I want to do what he did to me to everyone else I have ever cared about because I am so bitter and heartbroken. With guilt and with regret I cannot live like this anymore. All I wanted was to be a good mother. To be loved and understood. Left in the cold again. And again. This is such a complicated story to explain with many details missing. Just know that I do not think suicide is selfish. And I have felt like this since before I lost my love. I can never forgive myself for letting go of the one who truly loved me. I can not stand another second of this reality. To my sister I am sorry all I ever wanted was to be like you and make you proud of me. Thank you for being a mother to me I love you. To my son. Mummys sorry she put you in bad situations and pushed you away when you needed me the most. My zaney I will always treasure your curious little mind. To my daughter. I am sorry I could not be the strength you will need when you are grown just like me. Know that you where always my dream. I love you sweet girl. At my core I am empty.,Suicidal
25752,25772,It comes from Suetonius and I heard that the historian is not a particularly reliable one but still the idea itself is interesting.The passage Since ancient usage made it impious to strangle maidens young girls were first violated by the executioner and then strangled. Those who wished to die were forced to live for he Tiberius thought death so light a punishment that when he heard that one of the accused Carnulus by name had anticipated his execution and killed himself he cried Carnulus has given me the slip and when he was inspecting the prisons and a man begged for a speedy death he replied Ihave not yet become your friend. Death being a light punishment I cannot quite explain it but it feels so realistictrue. Carnulus has given me the slip that one should answer your question of Why am I forced to live. It is not beneficial for society if you kill yourself for it loses a working unit and you set up a bad example if that one escaped I can too.P.S. The first sentence of the passage is not about suicide but I left it in so your love for this world would rise a bit more. Emperor Tiberius on suicide,Suicidal
25753,25773,for the longest time suicide was like a second option for me. just having the choice to get rid of everything without having to worry about the future was comforting by itself. growing up anytime anything would go wrong id comfort myself that i would merely wake up from this nightmare if i mustered up the courage to kill myself. it was almost like someone would be whispering on my ear that things will be okay and to never take things seriously because there is a permanent off button. this mentality has stayed with me for years and now I am approaching adulthood. i will soon turn 18 years old. due to this mentality I have been academically slacking off and avoiding the topic of what do you want to do when you grow up. i told myself that i would never live to see the day i graduate and that its impossible that id ever become an adult. 10 year old promised me that i would kill myself before turning 18. my birthday is just a month away and I am scared. my younger self has gone through so much. my parents were always ones to never fulfill their promises and i do not wish to become like them. i want to at least do this for my 10 year old self whether i want to or not. my life has definitely not gotten any better. sure there were moments where id experience bursts of happiness and id actually feel glad to be alive but the down moments have been getting more frequent. i blamed my suicidal thoughts on this specific factor in my life which i got rid of a few months ago. things were actually getting better. i was actually talking to my dad more frequently and i was havign so much fun just talking to my younger brother. grades were looking fine and everything seemed to be going ridiculously well. my luck ran out just a month after and things were back to normal. my version of normal at this point is just sitting in my room all day without doing anything productive and having minimal contact with my family members. my suicidal thoughts soon continued and would frequently visit me every few hours. the reminder from my dad that id be kicked out once i turn 18 did not help either. when i was 13 i was actually attempting suicide for the first time. initially i wanted to run away from home but seeing how unrealistic it was i wondered if id die if i were to jump off the second floor of my house. logically speaking i would not have died but maybe i would have gotten medical help to cure these thoughts. i wish i could have reached out for help earlier in my life. i mean i do not think anybody would have done anything since they cannot exactly understand me. my dad was struggling so much as a single parent and I am sure he was suicidal himself. i heard from somewhere that these thoughts are hereditary so i would not be surprised if he suffers from them as well. i wish i could go back in time and talk to my younger self. today i got involved in a discussion which ended up with my dad and i practically talking about our past. once upon a time i was close with my dad and id actually talk to him everyday. with the flow of time we ended up talking less and less due to multiple conflicts. our relationship is now irreparable. i cannot get myself to hug him properly or tell him how much i love him because that is just so foreign to me. i feel so sorry for everyone including my past self. i did nothing but burden everyone with my issues. i wonder why i was born. i wonder what is the point of this life. I am in so much pain i do not know what to do. even now i have the choice to end it all but i do not think my dad deserves this. maybe I am just making excuses for myself. if i die who will take care of my cat anyway? i wish i could restart this life. just venting not in need of any kind of help,Suicidal
25763,25783,i was planning on killing myself in september but i really want to kill myself tomorrow or the next day. I want to kill myself so so badly but the only thing stopping me is that i do not want to ruin my sister or my best friends birthdays. my sister and i are not that close but i still really love her and want her to have a good birthday and my best friend is really the only person who cares about me and their birthday is at the end of august and i do not want to ruin it for them but i cannot do this anymore. i do not know how I am going to make it another 72 days i really cannot do this i just want to end it. i do not know what to do,Suicidal
25795,25815,idk when she is in pain i end up in pain x10 and just get extreme anxiety about her for random things and the fact its LDR does not helpI wish no one ever cared about me so I could just go in peace with no one giving a fuck there is no good reason so stay alive i should probably break up with my gf before i kill myself over her,Suicidal
25812,25832,First on the larger scale. 1. The world for humans is ending anyway the climate crisis is now felt tangibly year by year the air in my home country is unbreathable most of the time.2. Politically I do not see a future for this world. I do not even have an ounce of hope that we will globally overcome this political climate. As a leftist I feel capitalism cannot be overthrown and the incredibly aggressive backlash to wait for it the idea of human rights is simply devastating. If you are a right wing I am sure something similar could be said for you how will we get rid of gays or some shit. I can see how even with how things are going in the world if you are a well adjusted person you might find reasons to live within your community. So now on to the personal level.1. I was never equipped with the tools to live I was never taught how to stand up for myself how to behave in social settings how to resolve conflicts how to be passionate about things etc. I am uncomfortable around people and I definitely make them uncomfortable too or hate me. So many people hate me for reasons I cannot understand and they will not tell me. All the relationships I thought may be meaningful turned out to be meaningless. Either we did not understand anything about each other or did and hated it. I never feel stably connected to anyone.2. I was never equipped with the tools to live in this world in particular I could never hold down a job.I have seriously bad memory that does not allow me to become a professional at anything. I also have adhd making me unreliable. I do not even get hyperfixation which many adhd people can use to their advantage. In my entire life I have never been good at anything. Even as a child I was diagnosed dumb and proved to be weak as well. I have been chasing a profession for like a decade now and in the past couple years I started realizing that my memory issues and unreliability compounded with my lack of social skills will forever prevent me from succeeding in this very low paid profession as well. I do not know basic information required for this profession and I know for a fact that at least three big name people in the industry hate me already and I only just graduated. Probably pertinent to add that i only graduated because covid lowered the bar super low. And I was never passionate about it as other people in this field seem to be. It was just that some teacher said I should keep doing this the first ever validation I got that pushed me toward a concrete future. What a waste. I cannot even sell my body with how shit I am at social cues. I am a pushover people pleaser who cannot actually please people whether for work or for friendship. I have nothing to offer to the world and the world sucks anyway. Its just sad when people try to convince me to live when they briefly think they care about me. My list of reasons to die are impeccable.,Suicidal
25829,25849,Am 26 and still have not finished college. I got into the recent stock market craze and lost 100000 in liquid assets last March started with 14k life savings cash that I saved up in January that ballooned over a couple of months since then I mentally spiraled downwards and my grades suffered ended up getting academically suspended from college. It felt like I finally had a chance beyond a life of suffering wage slaving being stuck in a low socio economic swamp. I cannot even afford going to college anymore. Since March got help that is therapy and a psychiatrist which neither I feel so far has really helped in any significant fashion. I actually have since sessions and being prescribed medication sunk even worse into a black pit of despair. I do not think people understand even the basic surface level of mental health solutions in modern day. Just seeing a therapist and taking meds will not fix everyone. The state of how at least in America mental health treatment is addressed is frankly a joke. It was easier for me to get prescribed antidepressants than ordering a pizza. I flat out told my therapist that I thought my psychiatrist is a fucking clown. 15 minute session where you briefly describe your symptoms almost like a WebMD referral robot but it is an actual licensed professional and they just throw pills at you at the end of the expensive session voila come back for an in progress consultation if you need to more dosage or to hop to a different med that probably will have another slew of side effects. Talk to anyone that is actively or have been in therapy and ask them how many therapists they been to before they found the right one. Why is there such a core difference with these professionals? Because it is honestly a goddamn circus internally and I assume there is no standardized method of licensed schooling apparently. Go exercise. Take a hot shower. Have a routine. I do all of those things but I am just a high functioning depressed person that can clean do chores without my living conditions being something from rneckbeardnests. What am I doing now? Soon moving back home now to my backwards rural country hometown with no hope for the near or long term future I just been trying to distract myself reading books or playing video games listening to vinyl records .Honestly and truly I think I am going to end it all early August. There is not a single thing feeling goal in this universe that I desire anymore. Last night had a nightmare that brought up past mistakes even in my dreams I feel guilty and suffer. When I wake up I just feel like a walking zombie and the anhedonia saps every morsel from anything that I try to do. Resignation from Life,Suicidal
25856,25876,Dunno why I survived. Some days I am glad I did most days I wish I did not. do not want to get into details but I should not have survived the second attempt. I have never been able to get wanting to be gone out of my head. I guess my question is how do survivors handle it.. it is been so long but I struggle to appreciate I am still here. Maybe I should be grateful but I just do not feel it. What can I do? Thanks for reading this far and sorry to be a bother 2 attempts I am still here.,Suicidal
25858,25878,I am going to end up in hell anyway. And those bully would probably going to find new victim after I die and make their life miserable as mine. If I am going to kms I should just bring them together with me in hell. At least no one should suffer like me If I am going to kms I should just take them away with me right?,Suicidal
25882,25902,I made this throw away account for mainly for this post so there is no easy trace back to who I am. I have what I believe to be enough pills to take my life and I so desperately want to do this. I have lost interest in my hobbies I have stopped caring about my healthand I have pretty much stopped talking to people I care about. I want to take those pills go to bed and wake up in whatever place there may or may not be after we die in this plane of existence. I have everything ready...,Suicidal

26002,26022,I have been dating this girl for a year and a half talking about marriage future homes pets children. She cheated on me and ever since then I have felt worthless. Like living breathing garbage. She was my light my rock the person I confided all of my deepest secrets and darkest thoughts with and now its just... gone. All I can think about is how nice it would be to just not feel this pain anymore. No more waking up everyday going through the motions of being alone working a 95 that I hate with a passion and coming back to an empty house. The worst part of it is there is no escape from her. She works with me. Nothing in life feels right anymore its all upside down and I am falling. What do I do? Recently cheated on,Suicidal
26004,26024,but I am scared.it would hurt so bad but would it really hurt as bad as living life as i am?i felt like i tried i gave it my all.my mind wants to die but my body wants to live. i want to do it right this time.,Suicidal
26018,26038,i have blocked everyone that ever cared about me so that they cannot talk to me. they will stop caring about it in a few days then when this month is over i will kill myself by jumping off of a bridge with a backpack full of rocks to weigh me down. no one is going to stop me no one will love me therefore i am going to end it all at the end of this month,Suicidal
26067,26087,I lost so much in such a short amount of timeMy parents are so stubborn and ignorant I lost the love of my life who I have been with for 3 yearsLife is a messNothing brings me much joy anymoreIm thinking about ending it once and for all I have tried finding new love but people have looked at me and call me uglyPeople ghosting meIts quite clear that God made me to be a wretched imperfect smudge on earth meant to be miserable Everything is horrible,Suicidal

26102,26122,I do not know if I am 23 days left. I just want to switch off. I cannot do this shit anymore. Work is to overwhelming and my parents blame me for all the mistakes they make. I will be forgotten in a few years. Ready for death,Suicidal
26141,26161,like i just decided on a major I am still trying to find a job still cannot drive and I am feel like i will not cut it careerwise. i do not like where i am in life. but one thing i do know is i never going to get married and never going to have kids.maybe you can relate to these? i feel stress about future,Suicidal
26155,26175,I have been sleeping excessively the past two days because its the closest I can get to death. I have never felt so close to committing before. As I wake up and doze off again I just plan out what I am going to say in my notes but I cannot even get up to write them. All the sharps in the house are gone now so I was thinking of breaking the mirror in my room. But Ill probably pussy out. Just like last time. I wish I had the fucking guts to just get it over with. But Ill probably just go bad to bed lol. I cannot stand thinking. Being awake and having to think. do not even have the motivation to write my suicide notes,Suicidal
26200,26220,So recently I have been having thoughts of death. Even though I have a great life many friends great parents stable family good income etc... school has been taking a toll on me and has been putting stress on my parents. Now I do not want to die because of school but I just kind of do not want to live with the pressure of an adult life. You see I have no Idea what I want to do in the future and this has been stressing me since most people around me have already started in their career paths. I am way to afraid to commit suicide but yesterday without questioning i just thought what if a car just ran me over or a lightning struck me or something and I died I will not ever have to grow up and deal with all this bullshit. I hate school so much. Everyday i drag myself out of bed to commit to class fr 7 hours a day with mostly people and teachers i despise. Like i said idk the root of these thoughts since my life has always been great so what the fuck is wrong with me???? Thoughts of Suicide even though I have a great life?,Suicidal
26291,26311,I cannot take this anymore. I am somewhat happy but i hate my mindset my laziness my loneliness and environment around me. There is no future for me I am 100 sure. This world is not for me. I am serving in military right now I cannot socialize at all cuz they are talking different language. Every tuesday we are practicing at shooting range this is a perfect place to end it all. I do not want to feel bad ever again. Shooting range incident,Suicidal
26322,26342,This is a throwaway account and I am a teenager so please ignore the edgy username.When you think about it life is meaningless. We were born in a universe billions of years old theoretically and will exist for trillions of more. It is literally impossible for us to determine its vastness everything living in it currently to out knowledge just earthlings are mere chuck on molecules and chemical reactions that are keeping us alive. The very act of thinking is fundamentally just a chemical reactiona electronic charge in our brain.Of course if the universe has a meaning or not has nothing to do with our individual meaning and enjoyment of life which brings me to my problem. For the last 5 years I fell into the hole of nihilism.We have found comfort many concepts and ideology such as religion or family friends and our lovedones. Some believe that the existence of life is in itself worth living. For me those concepts arrive at deadend whenever I question it further. It becomes irrelevant. The idea of good or evil true or false becomes nothing. I think everybody deepdown understands this factchooses to ignore it from the existential horror and anxiety it brings. Personally these artificial constructs has no effect on the reality that we all facethe reality I feel.Look at how far we have came. The economical scientifical and technological advancement we has made that allowed us to connect through digitally. Yet what is the point really? Reality is when you die nothing will exist any longer. If you try to give death a mathematical equation it will be 0infinity. No time has passed but every time there will be has passes as well. It is like an escape to the inescapable curse that is nihilism. Once you see it you can never unsee it.I do not understand why I do not want to die yet wants to die so badly. I do not even know what to write on the title.,Suicidal
26339,26359,I had something planned out. Majority of the people said that it was quite peaceful to experience but some said that it was excruciatingly painful. If only some of you would suggest easy ways to do it without any BS or sarcasm. According to you all what would the easiest way to die be?,Suicidal
26348,26368,it is very difficult with so many people in the house. Yet I am certain in my belief that this is the thing to do. I do not want to trudge through a boring meaningless life. I have no friends everything is really a mundane mess. There are two principle means through which this end goal could be achieved . Either through hanging which I would not do unless I was certain that whatever contraption I had constructed would work in the intended manner or else driving my car in to a body of water the nearby river would do the trick.Hanging seems to appeal more to me the latter seems to be quite a terrifying thing to attempt. Although it would eliminate the chance of chickening out and if it achieved the same end goal then a few minutes of panicking should not be the dealbreaker.I am a huge loser. The must frustrating thing is that there are small things that could have been changed at 1314 which would have completely changed the trajectory of this life. I am not depressed I have just come to the conclusion that the continuation of my life would be a fruitless endeavor and I see no point in continuing as it will just become more and more pathetic. I am 20 years of age and a huge loser.People are always recommending things like Therapy and some peopleon the internet only nobody IRL would even suspect I am at this stage have recommended medication. The problem is that these things make sense if there is something worth salvaging. Someone can become a complete mess at 20 for several years on drugs for instance but recover. That is the case if they are built on a firm foundation there is no foundation and the entire structure is rotten. From the age of 1314 my life stood at a juncture I did not realize it at the time. think I am going to do it in the next few days,Suicidal
26365,26385,No matter what I try to do to be a good person to belong to be a warm friend nothing works and I always fuck it up. I do not fit in anywhere I constantly make people uncomfortable and I am really starting to wonder if my existence is harming people. Even yesterday when I tried to be a good person and fox a mistake I royally fucked everything up. I am so done I do not understand anymore,Suicidal
26380,26400,I have to make a call to my landlord and tell them why I still do not have rent I am a failure in so many ways. I cannot stop crying and I do not know why I am alive anymore. Maybe my stalker was right maybe I should just get it over with I am so deeply unhappy and nothing is going to get better. I was forced to go to this event downtown by people who would not take my anxiety into consideration and I am terrified I am going to get COVID in two weeks which is also my birthday.I cannot do this anymore. it is not okay,Suicidal
26386,26406,everything is okay with me. yesterday i went out with my friends to study at the library we went to a rooftop to eat burgers and danced while the sun set. i still text my friends and today i talked with my dad about the meaning of life. i met my chinese tutor and she bought me cheese tarts and we laughed about silly things. now why the fuck am i still so empty today? i want to kill myself. and there is absolutely no reason why. please i just do not get it. why do i feel this way? i have no reason to,Suicidal
26416,26436,I live in a country with no guns so I do not have a quick way out so any suggestions that would be quicker and I would rather the most painless way possible but at this stage I do not really care. I do not cut myself as I feel I could be easily caught so anything other than pills hanging knife or guns would be very helpful. Thanks Already tried overdosing and hanging it did not work after 50 pills so I need better suggestions to make it work this time.,Suicidal
26420,26440,I am only 20 but when you have been depressed since age 12 and you get shut down every FUCKING time you ask for help its hard to find a reason to keep going.I am a trans male my parents still deadname me and my dad thinks I am attention seeking. I have had many attempts at therapy over the years but it mostly consisted of what do you think your suicide would do to those around you? or idk what to do with you you are just clinging onto your depression so I think I really have completely given up now. It could potentially get better but I am far too tired and hopeless to cling onto that hope anymore. I did not ask to be born why should I be forced to live and suffer just because other people will be sad?The bridge only gets more tempting every day Is it ok to give up now?,Suicidal

26490,26510,Today was a really rough day. I am currently in a residential treatment program and away from my family and today I guess technically yesterday fucking blew. It stated off with a conversation with my mom where she confronted me about having issues with her and my dad. She was incredulous that there was anything she could have done that I had a problem with. This is a woman that sent me to weight watchers as a child called me a bitch in a family that referred to me as Cinderella because as the only girl I was expected to do extra chores chose my brothers over me time and time again. This is the woman that on the Mothers Day outing I had planned just for the two of us took a call with my brother for the first 20 min of our meal together. The mother that complained I made her miss the World Series because she had to visit me in the psych ward. And then made sure to bring it up again 10 years later. she is never said jack shit about that time except for remembering how she missed a fucking baseball game. Yeah I have fucking problem with you. The rest of the day was just killing time while I heard about everyone is plans for the 4th I am American. Obviously things are not going well I am in treatment for a reason and will be here for a while. But days like today are excruciating. Its like I feel like I am on fire or someone is poking me with a thousand needles while a weight presses down on my chest and throat making me feel like I am choking and suffocating at the same time. I cannot stand it. Truly. Right now I just wish I was dead. I do not want to feel like this anymore. I am so tired its exhausting. I feel like I have lived a million years I cannot take it. I feel like I just was not meant to be here. To be alive. I have no purpose each day is just a series of activities to pass the time. I am not in any immediate danger I am literally being checked on every hour anything sharp all meds and anything else potentially dangerously is either locked up or has been removed from the house. But that does not make it any easier. I am terrified that there is no hope for me. I am unfixable. And doomed to suffer for god knows how long. No one should have to endure this many years of pain. A goddamn lifetime of it. I do not see the point. I do not want to be here anymore. I want to die. cannot sleep and tired of being in this unbearable pain,Suicidal
26497,26517,I have hated myself since I was 10. Even at my best I am at my worse. I remember having vivid day dreams about hanging myself. I will not waste anymore of your time goodbye. Hello,Suicidal
26506,26526,Title says it all I am fearing Ill kill myself after all these years of tragedy and failure now that this has happened Girlfriend just broke up with me yesterday evening do not know how I will get through the next daysweeks,Suicidal
26508,26528,So I do not really know why it even matters to me. it is pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. it is just something I struggle to not think about. I have done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that is genuinely bothered me afterwards happened.So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form but the thought behind them was different. The first I really would not categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to.The second time I do not really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I would just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I am in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. I have not talked about this with anyone before. Idk maybe it is just bothering me because I am the only one that knows. What constitutes a suicide attempt?,Suicidal
26515,26535,they deserve to suffer so bad. I will kill myself that will teach them to be so neglectful. I will kill myself just to hurt people,Suicidal
26530,26550,Please make it stop. I do not want to live anymore. I do not want to feel anything anymore. How am I supposed to fight my depression and my OCD at the same time when every day that passes something worse than yesterday happens? Last night my heart was broken. Now I do not know how I can live with that because it ruined something inside me. I want to die and I am considering it. I can only endure so much pain and this is too much. I am trying so hard to fix everything but it is never enough because something far worse happens every day. What have I done to deserve this? I want to escape so badly but I have nowhere to go. I can only hope that god will save me. I am trying but I cannot,Suicidal

26623,26643,When the only thing I have ever cared about or looked forward to has been taken from me. I have one hobby that made me happy. I financially cannot do it anymore and mentally cannot do it anymore because of harassment and bullying from people in the community. I do not see it getting any better financially and I have been in therapy for as long as I can remember to get help with my social anxiety and other mental issues that make it fucking impossible for me to deal with people like that. I am fucked I am fucked I am fucked what is the fucking point,Suicidal
26674,26694,good lord what the fuck has my life come to. it keeps getting worse if i do not stop myself I am going to fucking kill myself. I am a horrible HORRIBLE person. i deserve to be dead. it is all my fucking fault. I am doing it before i hurt anyone innocent I am disgusting and filthy i deserve to fucking die,Suicidal
26687,26707,watching the fireworks tonight made me feel relaxed and warm and I realized that I will not be here for much longer but that is okay. something about the explosions and bright sky just made me realize everything will be okay in the future. I do not think that anybody depends on me anymore and I have failed my closest friend. I think that it is time for me to start wrapping things up. but maybe not for another month so I can at least finish some unfinished things but my time is soon. this sounds totally cringe so sorry but I am putting it out here for when I eventually do pass just as a little letter to whoever it may concern. it is not your fault. you did nothing wrong. thank you for existing and even if I am gone I think you should stay. thank you and sorry. you do not have to put up with me anymore it is time to be free.ampx200Byou were always and will always be greater than me.ampx200Bsee you again but not soon. goodnight I hope the dreams are good. lt3 the fireworks made me truly content,Suicidal
26688,26708,since my last attempt. i did not try hard enough.i feel so alone and a bother to everyone. i do my best to not take up much space. not eat because i feel i do not deserve it. it would be so much easier i think if i was just...gone.I am scared to get close again. to people online and off. but i want to. so badly.i did not think I would make it this far and now i do not know what to do.it is so lonely. it is been a year.,Suicidal
26720,26740,Mentally I am a wreck. I have lost myself in a wayward spiral of depression because I have always felt abnormal. I am a pathetic mess. i have people tell me all these great positive things about me whether I am good vibes a good friend and so forth but despite any earnestness in their voice i second doubt myself and fight the tears. It never helped that throughout the years I have been bullied and isolated amongst peers. Its ruined my ability to speak verbally opposed text and my brain feels flat. As a writer I feel like there is something greener out there but it feels off when I cannot make connections or become an after thought in the grand schemes of things. i feel like I am destined to be alone and at this point Id rather just be alone forever in a white hollow space by myself and have continuous torture be instilled upon me by my own thoughts. I keep telling myself everything will be fine despite how much it hurts,Suicidal
26774,26794,I went so far as to convince my best friend to knowingly allow me to kill myself. I changed my mind on my plan. Gave up my gun. Been at therapy nonstop. The thoughts are back. I cannot even tell anyone. I am too ashamed that I am not better. I just spend my time alone avoiding interaction. Its been around a year since I put all of my closest friends through their personal hell with my suicidal thoughts. I do not have anyone I cam confide in that they are back.,Suicidal

26871,26891,I have been contemplating suicide more and more every day for years and specifically over the last few months those thoughts have been escalating to where its not a matter of if but when. My method in which I plan to go out death by gun. I have a 9mm pistol already. I went out into a field today and shot it just to test how it behaves. I pulled the trigger and a shot rang so loud it left my ears ringing for a minute. I could feel the raw power of the weapon which I held. It just donned on me the idea I am going to do this to myself? This is what it takes to die?. Apparently so. Its just so intimidating. I think about what people in my life will be like after I kill myself. Part of me is scourged by the fear of missing out. I wonder what my dad will think. We do not have a good relationship but I wish I knew what would be on his mind. All of this reminds me how fragile life is. I still very much want to kill myself but the closer I get to committing and the more I think about it the more I realize how much there is to think about. Life is crazy. Just needed to put this somewhere. Thanks for reading The thought of mortality gets weird and more intimidating the more I think about it,Suicidal
26907,26927,I am going through a lot right now and if I had an easy way to commit suicide like a gun I would have blown my brains out today. I just do not know how to do it and that is scaring me because I have never gotten to the point I am now where I really do not want to live anymore. I really need a friend,Suicidal
26932,26952,And none of this people will be sad nonsense. Yeah maybe. But quite frankly I do not really care. I am dissociated all the time so none of them seem real to me anyway. All I feel is pain my pain their pain the whole goddamn world's fucking pain. I cannot feel anything good. The only things keeping me going are human survival instinctthe vague knowledge it is not what you are supposed to do and the fear of permanent brain damage or disability. I am already sick I do not want to be more sick. And I do not want to be more trapped. My biggest fear is being trapped that is why I want to do this. Is there any legitimate reason I should not kill myself?,Suicidal
26958,26978,We are not doing good money wise rn and my dad refuses to sell any of the 30 guns he has so we can eat dinner. I have not had anything to really eat in three days. All I have had are pretzel sticks. My stomach is hurting a lot. I just want to end it so bad to get out of this. I cannot get a job my sister refuses to and my dad keeps running off to a town two hours away to fuck some chick he met in highschool. I need help but I do not know where to find any.. I am starving,Suicidal

27051,27071,I have been having a very difficult 8 months in all the ways possible and had been contemplating taking my life for basically the entire time. it is not something I have really talked to many people about and had been working to see a therapist as soon as possible but have been having issues thanks to insurance. I kept telling myself if I feel this way in 3 months then I will look into my options to end the pain. And 3 months came and went and I still felt that way. 6 months passed and I would find myself laying in my bed with tears in my eyes watching the latest news of how humanity is destroying itself and wishing I was not alive. 8 months went by in a depressive fog and I continued trying to give myself hope for a future with very little luck. It has felt like despite trying to do everything right nothing has gone right or even slightly in my favor. This morning I felt the urge to end my life stronger than I have felt in my adult life. In a puddle of tears contemplating how to take my life I asked myself what am I even living for anymore? And my phone rang. My phone ID showed the caller was my beloved sister who I have not talked to in months. I could not bring myself to tell her my mental struggles but hearing her voice saved me. And without knowing what I was going through she delivered the words I needed to hear most. She gave me hope again when I felt it was all but lost. From one sad heart to another PLEASE do not give up hope. The people who love you would miss you more than could be put into words. I know this bc I have survived many suicides in my life and each one hurt in ways I still have not been able to fully process. It may feel rough today tomorrow and possibly for years to come. But it does get better. Just remind yourself that you can do hard things even if the hard thing is an internal battle with yourself. But if you give up that fight you do not end the pain you just gift the pain to anyone who has ever loved you.My only advice is do not struggle alone it makes everything so much harder. Call someone anyone you know that cares call a crisis hotline write an anonymous post go do something you love try something new but especially treat yourself with kindness. You are not required to be happy every second of every day of your life. You are human and the human experience is a messy one. So be messy love. do not lose hope.,Suicidal

27116,27136,i want to thank you for all the good memories and being there when i was stuck in that house. However at this point I figure its time to put things to an end. I do not really have much to do or look forward to anymore. many of the things i wanted to do or create are pretty obviously unreachable at this point. Most of my goals were built on fake promises. First always dreaming of going to austria then any european country then florida. Its obvious none of its meant to be. I do not want to be a burden to you yet again or bother you with sad memories. You deserve the best and most love and appreciation in life and i encourage you to forget me. Or at least not think of me often. I do not even know who or what i was to you. All i wanted was to make you feel happy and loved but i guess i was pretty incapable of that much of the time lol. I hope you can reach what i wanted. hypothetical,Suicidal

27139,27159,Background I have had depression and anxiety for ten years. Particularly bad episode this last month. About a year ago I came very close to taking my own life and recently have been back on drinking and taking pills to numb pain. Have also been self harming.My doctor surgery has a policy that to make an appointment you have to call at 830 in the morning and they will give you and appointment for that same day. Have been ringing them for weeks but the phone line is always busy. Rang them outside of the 830 window and told them I have been trying to make an appointment for weeks that my mental health is severely deteriorating and I need to speak to my doctor as soon as possible. They said they cannot offer me an appointment unless I call at 830am in the past I have managed to get appointments outside of this time if its urgent but the woman on the phone was not being helpful. She said to go online and fill out a form. I did and specified that I am feeling suicidal. They said someone would come back to me within a few days. A week passed and I did not hear back so I emailed them to complain and asked why my mental health is not being taken seriously. They did not respond and still have not. My therapist told me she does not know what else she can do for me and she thinks I need to see a psychiatrist and she will write a referral letter. I asked her when it would be ready and she said in a day or two. did not hear anything back from her after a few days so emailed her and she said she forgot to clarify that she was going away for ten days and so would do the letter when she returns.Contacted my private healthcare and spoke to the doctor there did not call them initially because my NHS GP has all my medical history and was the one who started me on my medication. She prescribed antidepressants. The system on the private healthcare app glitches so the prescription was pending and had not been sent to the pharmacy so I cannot pick up the medication. Will take days or weeks to resolve this as this has happened in the past. Even if I do get the antidepressants they will take weeks to kick in.Called private healthcare again and asked for a direct referral to a psychiatrist. They authorised it but out of the five psychiatrists I contacted for a consultation all either did not come back to me or told me they are not taking on new patients. All the effort to keep calling doctors and writing emails is more than I can bear as I am not eating at all and am paralysed from the depression. So the fact that I am trying and getting nowhere is really defeating.Last night I had severe panic attacks on a busy street to a point where people were asking what I had taken because I was so paranoid and was not in my right mind. I had not taken drugs I was just having a nervous breakdown. I could not breathe for HOURS because the panic attacks were constant one after another. At least four strangers called an ambulance but the ambulance said they will not come because they are too busy.Today I called NHS 111 and was spent the whole day speaking to various agents who would take me through the same set of questions each time. No help. Just passed me around from doctors to mental health services with no outcome. Finally a doctor told me she made an appointment for me at the urgent care centre. I told her I did not have the strength to leave the house but she urged me to go due to my state. Got to the hospital and they have no record of my appointment and so the nurse booked me in as crying for no reason. I was in such a state I could hardly speak but I did say I was having panic attacks all day so not sure why she trivialised it. She said the wait time is over two hours so I was back to being surrounded by strangers while continuing to have uncontrollable panic attacks. I left the hospital because I felt too sickexposed to stay there in that room for two hours. Called NHS 111 again and had to go through the same questions that I had already had to answer five times today. Told the guy on the phone that I have been trying to get help for weeks and no one will help me and all he kept saying is do you feel your symptoms are getting worse since you last called us. What else am I supposed to say to them? I have been struggling to breathe for 18 hours straight to a point where my throat is raw from where I have been gasping for air. I have expressed over and over that I am feeling suicidal. I hung up because I realise I was going round in an endless circle.There is nowhere else for me to turn now. My story,Suicidal
27156,27176,This place is full of crushing facts of real life I feel you bro nonsense encouragement and of course the ever present do not kill urself you are so fucking precious.

27168,27188,I am prolly going to go hang my self later today I want to stab the shit out of my brother because ever since he existed my parents only cared for him every time he makes a mistake they are so nice but for me they just constantly say how useless I am. I really do not see the point in living. Ill just give my important stuff to friends and depart from this miserable world. Bye Its normal to have urges to stab someone right?... right?,Suicidal

27187,27207,Like it is that easy to stop. I do not want to be alive anymore! Why cannot you understand that? Yeah it is going to leave a void in your lives. So what. that is life man. You want me to continue living in this hell just to make you happy? Not what makes me happy? Making me live in this fucked up life in suffering forever. Parents basically said stop being so suicidal...,Suicidal

27228,27248,I have been sat here with a knife for the past 20 minutes debating if I should go through with it or not. Nobody likes me and the rest of my life is not worth living anymore. I do not know what to do,Suicidal
27249,27269,Yeah that is my question. If mentioning that you are getting suicidal ideation enough? Or someone has to nearly attempt or make an unsuccessful attempt? I am not interested in going there but I am just curious because I have seen posts where they were sent to psych wards for the smallest of the things. Serious question. What is enough to end up in psych ward in the US?,Suicidal
27312,27332,I have thought about ending it all so many times but now the time has come. I really start consider it as an option. Before this very day I always could convince myself that there is at least something to go for one goal to achieve and work for but not anymore.After more than 10 years I finaly met the love of my life and I really could not be happier that day it was even more than I hoped for.That did not last until the end of the day though when she confessed to me the following things It was purely exhausting for her and not a single minute of relaxation. Nothing ever had a meaning for her. She also said she had to meet someone in real life to have a connection to them she did not build up one to me though. The chances of her falling in love with me ever so slightly are even worse than before. She only desired me because her boyfriend neglected her. Cuddling with me never felt good for her in any way she wanted to make me happy for at least one moment which she achieved mind you.She also told me she does not know yet if she even wants to see me again which hit the hardest of all. I did not just lose all hope in ever being in a relationship with the woman I love but I also know now how much of a burden I am to even have around.You might find my problems laughable but there really was nothing else in my life I ever had to go for but her and now I have ruined it by being myself. I do not know how I will do it yet but I am pretty sure now I have completed the last chapter in my life and it was such a bittersweet ending. I have lost the last meaning in my life,Suicidal
