33895,Health anxiety following stomach flu anyone else? I have moderate to severe health anxiety especially when Im sick then its pretty severe. About 6 days ago I came down with a stomach virus and was violently puking and had water like diarrhea sorry if TMI. By day 3 I was no longer feeling the nausea or diarrhea but have a general sense of being unwelldehydrateddrained. I feel as though my anxiety is playing a big factor because I cant stop thinking about it and feel like Im drained and depleted which isnt normal cause my energy is usually very high. Is it normal for constant worrying to drain you and wear you out physically??? ,Anxiety
34089,Can anyone describe what the symptom of back pain from cancer feels like? I read a lot that back pain is a symptom of cancer However I can't find a description of what that back pain feels like. I can't even find a description that says there is no commonality to back pain from cancer. So it leaves me in the dark.Is there anything that describes what the pain feels like? Does it not stop even if you lie still? Does it stay in one location or does it move around? Can it be light pain or is it always a severe pain? I would love to know if there's anything common to this pain or if any back pain ie. small large constant only when moving reproducible nonreproducible etc are all symptoms of cancer?,Anxiety

33929,Trying a new way of thinking. My day normally looks something like this...Oh man I'm dizzy. I wonder what that means. Any my left arm is weak. Is that a heart attack? Maybe a symptom of a small heart attack? Where did I get that bruse on my knee? Is that a sign of a blood clot? Should I go to the doctor again? Last time he told me to stop worrying about stuff like this. Is that a lump I'm the back of my head? Maybe that's what's causing my head ache... But what is the lump is another sign of a problem? Should I start documenting this? The doctor thinks I'm crazy but if I have all the symptoms with the times I had them he could surly run more tests. A friend I knew died for a blood clot that the doctors missed maybe my doctor missed something... etcRecently I started asking my friends that don't have anxiety how they deal with strange feelings in their body. Every single one of them says that they almost immediately dismiss the thought. I can't even imagine what that feels like. I focus on a part of my body so much sometimes that I actually create pain that doesn't exist. So I dug a little bit deeper and asked what happens if they were walking around one day and all of a sudden they noticed that their left arm was weak and tingly. Most of my friends with without anxiety said the same thing. I guess my arm is weak today. And then that's it. If they have a headache or if they have a chest pain or if they have an upset stomach or if their leg hurts out of nowhere they just shrug it off and think oh I guess today I'm going to have a stomach ache or I guess I'm coming down with something or something to that nature. And then if it still hurts the next day they shrug it off again and only when it's continuing to do it for like a week do they actually think I'll maybe I should go to the doctor and have it looked at. But it's not in a panicky kind of way it's just kind of like almost annoyance.So I'm going to try that method. Oh I guess I have a headache today. And try to leave it at that. If it lasts a week all the talk to my doctor.Has anyone had success doing something like this? Like just changing the way you thought?,Anxiety

34145,Lightheadedness A few days ago I did a pass out challenge. I know it's incredibly stupid but after seeing almost all my friends perform it and describe it as pleasant I decided to try it. I experienced what I believe to be a euphoric high and then I regained consciousness. However the lightheadedness from performing it never faded. Anyone got any ideas?

33889,Final doctor appointment tomorrow tired of constantly seeking reassurance! Ive decided that Im having my final doctor appointment tomorrow this is something that has been a huge battle for me but over the last weeks I have decided that this is the only way I can and will make it out of this anxiety.Here is the deal I have been experiencing multiple symptoms as mentioned before in other posts the symptoms have varied from Brain fog dizzyness blurred vision sore throat swollen tonsils coating on my tongue yellow and white very reduced energy fatigue and headaches. The thing is that my sore throat and coating on my tongue wont go away and my doctor said to come back if it didnt fade over time the other symptoms tend to come and go so Ive kinda figured out that these are my main anxiety symptoms which is good because then I know when im getting anxious and stressed out!Ive been a very heavy caffeine user over the past 23 years and ive tried to minimalize the usage of it as I figured out that i basicly needed caffeine to function at times. Today i used a bigger dosage of caffeine and it really got me feeling off so I guess i will be dropping it off completely atleast for now when im feeling anxious and stressed out about my health situation.Even though I feel somewhat weak and off Ive learned a lot from this fear of health problems and I personally think that it had made me a more strong and better person. Tomorrow I will have my final chat with my doctor and I am ready to accept his word for the truth hopefully this will take my mind to other places. Its wierd how something as minor as a sore throat lasting for a long time can make you feel so sure its something serious!,Anxiety

34156,Hantavirus anxiety Hello folks. I am trying to ease some of my fear of hantavirus. I work in a place that does have a deer mice presence. Recently I went into a utility closet to grab a dolly. I noticed rodent droppings on the floor. I didn't mess with them at all but I did definitely breathe while I was in there. Does anyone have any understand of hantavirus on a deeper level? I know it is extremely rare and caused by kicking up dust that has been contaminated. But what are the odds that I get hantavirus assuming the mouse excrement in that closet was even infectious? I seem to be the only person at my work who has any real concern over it and it's driving me nuts.Thanks so much for any insight.,Anxiety
33987,Im 19 yo and my hair is thinning and more worrying symptoms I first noticed my hair thinning two months ago. I've always had thick hair that would grow pretty quickly. Now my hair's gotten thin and quite dry. The thinning is more extreme on the sides of my head with visible patches at the top there arent any such patches but still thinning and dryness. I impulsebought biotin tablets to help with the thinning but im hesistant to take them at the moment since nothing's been diagosed yet.But it's not just the hair. I have also been getting although not frequent a tingling sensation in my right fingers and sometimes on a whole hand at times. More recently say the last week or so my vision's gotten blurry. I don't know if the blurred vision is permanent and i've just gotten use to it or not but ive definitely had these phases. Ive looked up my 'symptoms' and what's come up are thyroid conditions B12 deficiencies and a whole load more. With B12 deficiency in particular its symptoms seem to align with mine pretty closely. Other than my symptoms ive mentioned already B12 deficiency symptoms include 'tiredness' and 'memory loss' i feel like i have these or atleast they're more pronounced recently ive always been fairly forgetful.Im genuinely worried if i have some serious conditon. Ive booked an appointment with my doctor and hopefully i can get however many of these symptoms i actually have sorted. Sorry for this being so long winded. Stay healthy friends.,Anxiety

34212,Up and down So my health anxiety focuses on getting pregnant Im terrified of it dont ever want to be Im 20 and no doctor will tie my tubes. I thought either my contraceptive implant was broken i would do pregnancy tests and not trust the result or go digging through the bin for them I didnt trust a blood test I thought every twinge in my body was a symptom. I thought I saw signs everywhere telling me I was pregnant.Then last week after 3 CBT sessions upping my anti depressants and travelling home to see my parents for the first time in 4 weeks I had the first good week since September. No tests no doctor visits plenty of exercise could snap myself out of any dangerous thought patterns. No googling! I was so happy and proud. I even had sex for the first time in 4 months with my boyfriend. Then on Saturday morning my boyfriend accidentally grabbed my arm implant. Since then I feel like Ive spiralled back of control after just one week of happiness. Ive resisted doing a test so far but I swear my implant is broken even after seeing a nurse Im symptom spotting googling crying etc. My techniques to cope arent working. I go from feeling scared and upset to angry with myself and the world.I was just wondering how do people cope with these type of set backs? How do you pull yourself up again? At the minute I just feel sad and depressed and angry. Fuck you health anxiety.,Anxiety

Im always worried about my liver failing or something like that because I drink. Im not an alcoholic by any means at most Ill have 4 drinks maybe twice a week. Im 21 so thats kind of the norm in college but I still worry. A lot of my health anxiety is about other people as well. I constantly worry that my boyfriend is going to die for example. I know its so stupid and that Im fine but the worrying overtakes me. I know this started after the sudden death of a loved one.

34116,Just venting a bit... Hello guys. For the past month or so Ive been dealing with daily stress from thinking I have something. It started out with weakness and fatigue and stomach and stool issues which I attributed to colorectal cancer. After multiple blood tests and ct scans that found nothing I made the mistake of looking up my symptoms on doctor google and found als. Ever since this was early Jan Ive been over analyzing every symptom I have and havent had real peace of mind. Its taken a huge toll on me mentally and I plan to get help. Im the last 3 weeks Ive gone from having twitches all over to burning in my arms to twitching in my hand and now what looks like atrophy in my thenar muscles. I am scared and I just wanted to get it off my chest since my neuro referral wont come for like another month. Things I have going for me I am a 23 year old Hispanic male and statistically less probable to get the disease. my twitches are widespread which is uncommon in als. Only recently have they been in my right hand more focused. the lack of strength I originally felt isnt there anymore nor am I dropping things or have any strength loss that I can see. I have gotten back into the gym and can lift things comfortably and well. no family history of neuro diseases. this has been going on for a month without affecting my life other than mentally Things I worry about My right hand palm has some visible dents and lines that I feel have gotten more pronounced. This has not resulted in weakness but they seem to have gotten worse. Ive googled a lot of pictures and compared to friends and family and I havent found any that look like mine. All Ive found are clearly atrophied which at that point is completely obvious and dont look like mine. Mine look as though Im missing muscle strips and crevices. on the same right hand the thenar muscles have begun twitching as of 5 days ago. My index finger especially will twitch and jump on its own. Also my right thumbhand is less flexible than my left. Thanks for reading ,Anxiety

Just looking for possibilities I guess here's what happenedI'm preparing to move by putting stuff into boxes today I focused on decorations such as figurines around the house military memorabilia books and small miscellaneous items. The only thing out of the ordinary was an old roommate's uniform that moved out like 6 months ago that was sitting under where I put my motorcycle helmet I picked it up and unfurled it saw it was his put it in my roommates pile of stuff. About 45 minutes later give or take my arms became itchy incredibly itchy.When I looked at it it looked like a rash all on one side of my forearm basically exactly where the uniform touched and then a couple of welt like spots a bit away. I washed my arms but a little bit after I was itchy on the middle of my back shoulder upper thighs calves ankles chest and stomach. I hopped immediately in the shower and changed clothes.There is a chance it was old fuel on the uniform I have a stuffed nose and can't smell a thing. My friend hasn't had a rash of any sort.

34106,Nervous about pain in throat after eating garlic amp venting Hi everybodySo Ive been suffering from health anxiety for about 4 years now. It all started with a donkey biting my arm while on vacation. Since then Ive had the rabies shots twice. I go to my doctor many times a year. Ive developed a chronic pain on my shoulder. And I pretty much freak out over every little symptom.Last night my mom called me to tell me she was coming down with a cold. I remembered that yesterday I borrowed her scarf and used it all day. Wanting to prevent a cold I crushed a raw garlic clove and ate it. Ive done this before many times and normally it just gives me a little acid reflux. Ive noticed that raw garlic keeps me pretty healthy overall. However this time I developed a burning sensation in my throat about fives minutes after I ate it. It has now been burning me for about 6 hours. I woke up in the middle of the night and have not been able to go back to sleep. I had some milk and a banana and took ibuprofen to see if it would help the painburning sensation. Even my chest started hurting which never usually happens to me. Im embarrassed to go to the hospital for just a stupid raw garlic but my mind is going there and Im already catastrophizing everything ie Ive burned a hole through my throat this will somehow lead to death etc. Im hoping the symptoms go down within the next couple of hours otherwise the pain will get the better of me and I might actually go to the emergency room.In times like these I hate myself and how miserable I make life for myself. Why cant I just get over these dumb fears? If I wasnt so afraid all the time I wouldnt have eaten the garlic. My anxiety and negative thinking is probably making my pain and symptoms worse Im an expert at that.Im just really tired of constantly being in pain for some reason or another. This sucks. ,Anxiety

33996,Do I have Anxiety or Schizophrenia? 18 Male 5'8 Caucasian no previous diagnosed medical conditions or medications but I think I have Social Anxiety and mild GAD. No relatives that I know of with schizophrenia however my dad is adopted so I can't know for sureI KNOW only a psychiatristgp can diagnose me properly. I am asking here to see if it's worth to do so.For maybe half a year now I've had constant anxiety of having schizophrenia. It started with me being in school walking through the corridor and hearing my name being called even though I know I probably just misheard someone else talking. I went home and googled schiz symptoms and since then have been constantly worrying about it..Other symptoms Music playing in my head. Can be hard to make it stop. Sometimes when Ive smoked weed it feels literally impossible to make it stop.Constantly repeating conversations in my head or preparing for future ones. Also it feels like most of my thoughts are thought of as if im in a conversation if you understand what I mean by that.Auditory hallucinations ? Heard my name being called a couple of separate times when walking around town amp in school. However one time at a night club it happened like 58 times in one night was quite drunk amp anxious the dayevening before. It's NOT in a distinct voice its just someone else next to me who's talking about something completely different and my brain just misfires and I hear my name instead.. Also Idk if it counts as hypnagogic hallucinations but when I meditate I a random word or sentance can pop up in my head but it can be in a different voice than my own inner monologue often someone i know. However it really doesn NOT feel like a voice talking to me more like intrusive thoughts that are in the voice of someone else but im the one thinking? its not loud or anythingQuite often several times a day when seeing some random person on the street I recognize someone I know for a split second then I realize it wasn't them. Saw some interview with a dude with schiz who said this was one of his first symptoms but with carsPoor control of my inner monologue. I tend to overanalyze every single thought that I have. Because of this I have somehow caught the habit of thinking Would someone with schizophrenia do this or does this mean I have schizophrenia?Seeing things out of the corner of my eye.Slight sensation that people in school might be talking shit about me however like 2 seconds after that happens I realize how ridiculous it isI have smoked quite a lot of weed the last 2.5 years but lately have not been smoking much at all. It tends to make my anxiety worse and hyperactive the last time I smoked when i was walking home i was paranoid about anyone looking at me through windows and when I walked past 2 guys I was convinced they were talking about me.No delusions paranoia when sober depersonalization social life is good etc. I feel ''sane'' but can not stop having thoughts of schizophrenia.What do you guys think? I posted a similar post in raskdocs and rschizophrenia and most of them said I'm fine but I'm still extremely scared.,Anxiety

33977,Dog died on New Years scared of rabies Okay so I posted this on the anxiety subreddit and that should of been enough but my anxiety still is being awful so uh posting this here too since health anxiety is a big one for be in general anyway...? Sorry Basically I had an old dog like 14 years old. He started sleeping a lot more around Christmas and all and when I cold front blew in that week he started having a harder time walking around he'd been wobbly already and then Thursday he collapsed on his front legs and couldn't eat back up. His front legs couldn't move but back legs were fine and he ate and drank what we gave him fine. During that Thursday I absent minded lot scratched the inside of my nose after doing something and he licked which is what started the paranoia.My poor dog couldn't move but his back legs still could and his jaw never got paralyzed and he never got the excess salivating deal.We have him pain meds at a vets advice which seemed to of gotten his front legs working again still back legs working too he just couldn't get up yet. But he was moving more his head too. He even ate that day. Unfortunately he started bloating fell into a coma and died that day which was New Years.I've brought my paranoia up with the vet and he did say with everything I told him and showed him that rabies shouldn't even be a concern. Another commenter seemed to agree too.And yeah I know better he wasn't even paralyzed in that way it was the pain in his bones the pain meds helped him in those final moments. And he never had a hanging mouth he could move it and eat fine and didn't foam or excessively salivate or anything. But even still I've been absolutely paranoid every since despite knowing better. Despite knowing that wouldn't of been rabies since if it was his limbs wouldn't of gotten better but my mind keeps telling me what if it is what if it is what if it's too late and you'll have it and your mom will have it and you'll dieUgh. I know I'm going to get a full doctor checkup tomorrow and take steps to get help with my anxiety but as it is right now it still feels so awful and constraining. I can't even focus on my usually drawing or other creative ideas because this anxiety has gotten in the way so much. I can't even properly grieve my dogs death because of this. I'm scared despite being told that it shouldn't even be a consideration. I hate it.,Anxiety

34023,Im a gay male hypochondriac so anxious about getting HIV. Its affecting my life and relationships. Why do I feel like this? I have always had some form of hypochondria and more recently it has overrun my life and relationships. I am deeply anxious all the time. Im not intimate because of fear even though Im in a monogamous relationship and Im very conscious of my surroundings. For example if Im walking and someone coughs near me I have to look the other way or turn around directions. If someone sneezes same thing. I have to get as far away from them. Also if I go out to eat i have to see food being prepared like sushi or salads in front of me if I notice something off like worker using no gloves or touched something differently I buy the salad and struggle to eat it after inspecting it for blood or bodily fluid many times. I feel like my body is contaminated or some disease is brewing inside me all the time even though my latest blood work last August was all negative. Im a habitual hand washer and sanitizer and I use alcohol to sanitize my razors toothbrushes before every use. I know HIV is very hard to get but over the past couple years i have been tested over 100 times including majority over the counter HIV test for 40 each. This is crippling me and I want to resolve this fear. ,Anxiety

33956,Worried something is wrong with my heart I have been having occasional chest pains on and off for a week and a half now and I've been struggling to sleep. Well I was taking a bath after exercising and I didn't really do anything but turn to the side to reach for some bath gel and I felt something similar to a pop in my chest. It was right in the area that my heart would be. I thought it was odd and when I stood slowly I felt a little light headed to get out of the bath. I had two short quick pains in that same spot and now I haven't had any pain since that. There is no heaviness in my chest. My stomach is fine. But my heart has been feeling like it's been pounding not long after that. I've been feeling like I should just give in and head to the ER.. It's taking everything I have to not ask to go because I don't want to go and end up getting a big bill over nothing because I don't think my insurance will cover it.

34108,Really bad health anxiety at night Some background... I was diagnosed with OCD in the third grade but was suspected of having it long before that. I have bad intrusive thoughts. I've been in and out of therapy for many years. Within the past few years my health anxiety has gotten bad again like it was when I was a child. In late 2016 when I was 19 I went through a phase where I thought I was dying Every. Single. Night. I ended up having so many panic attacks and losing a lot of friends. I lost over 60 pounds in like 23 months. I got into a relationship on the tail end of this breakdown and am still with my partner. It helped a lot and continues to help.Now like a year and a half later it's not as bad as it was in that period but the symptoms linger still. I haven't had a checkup since a little before the breakdown in 2016. I'll go to the doctor if I catch a cold or whatever but not for a checkup.Now....this is because I'm like terrified that I'll find out that I have a terminal illness. Cancer of any type kidney failure some kind of disease... whatever it doesn't matter. Whenever I think about it I freak out and get nauseous and scared. When I'm laying in bed at night I will feel my boobs for lumps and always convince myself something is there when it isn't in different parts of my boobs. I've gotten to a point where I dont even like touching them. I know it would be better to just find out and get to fix it asap but it scares me so bad I'm afraid it would just ruin my will to live. I'm not currently in therapy but I know i need to be.It's the worst at night when my boyfriend is asleep but it's seeping over into my daily life. If my biology prof starts talking about cancer my thoughts just spiral out of control making me think I have it. It's gotten so bad that I actually have anxiety about the anxiety itself. I just need to know that I'm not alone. I would also appreciate any advices or exercises that help...,Anxiety

I REALLY want to google my symptoms to make sure Im not having a stroke or aneurysm as thats exactly what i fear whenever i get these random spasmspains. Im trying to not think of the worst thing as nothing else is wrong with me. I got these in the past its just been a while. I REALLY want to google but i shouldnt right? If it was deadly well Id probably already be dropped dead not typing this coherently etc etc. Trying to calm myself as to not go into a wave of anxiety.,Anxiety

45912,I'm planning to end my life in August. At least now I know why i'm like this. Eating disorder childhood trauma abusive relationship toxic work environment lots of hard drug abuse 25 year later a psychiatrist finally tells me I have bipolar disorder. Feels like a lot of things suddenly click and fall into place. Why I get so restless and high energy and so hyper focused on sex or cleaning or things like that just to crash into nothingness. Why I always feel torn into multiple pieces. Why I can't cope with work why i'm alone I have no friendships why I hate looking at myself in the mirror.The diagnosis doesnt change my plans for the Summer but at least now I feel a little less like a lost fish drowning especially reading things other people wrote and how I can relate to it. Sorry if some of this sounds weird my English is weird todayMy favorite sub got deleted today so I just wanted to share somewhere. Thanks,Bipolar

46336,First time posting on reddit... need helpadviceinspiration for dealing with a bipolar depressive episode Hello there.I am 23 years old and officially got diagnosed with bipolar type 1 about a year and a half ago after being hospitalized from a monthlong manic episode. after that I was on EI for 4 months and had to take a break from school. Basically it ruined my life.The meds helped me remain stable with a little bit of depression here and there.. nothing major. For the past 5 weeks I have fallen into a deep depression. I am crying on the floor feeling physically paralyzed can't see my friends and having very dark thoughts. I saw my psychiatrist and therapist last week and we upped my meds. I am now on 200mg Lamictal 60mg Latuda and 100 mg Modafinil. I also started light therapy work out 4 days a week take vit d iron and omega 3s meditate and am starting CBT therapy next week. I feel like I'm doing all of the right things.. which is why i feel SO frustrated that nothing seems to be working. Oh and I got my hormonal IUD taken out as my naturopath said it might be causing my mood problems.I don't want to die. There is so much more I want to do in life. But being severely depressed is no way to live.People with bipolar... what med combos are you on? What other therapy has worked for you? How did you get better? I need some hope in my life right now...Thanks all in advance. It was hard for me to post this.,Bipolar
46011,Finding a job when depressed is impossible. Finding new job I stressful by its nature for anybody. But when you depressed it gets million times harder. Fact of not haveing no job a specially if you have absolutely no savings is hard. Amounts of stress are incredible and thoughts spiralling arround head aren't marking it any easier. And there comes depression when doing anything seems like impossible amount of effort. So even if I make myself to apply and get to interview it is all for nothing. There is absolutely no one who would hire me I know I wouldn't. Everyone looks for someone happy enthusiastic someone they will like to work with. There os no chance in the world they will like me I don't so why anyone would.Another think is when I think how I lost mu previous job. I have been harassed and discriminated for long time. My manager was not being but hostile towards me to over a year. I know is not how everyone behaves but it makes me feel worse. At this point I have no job and no perspective to get one. I have no job so I have no money and I mean 0 nothing. I can't pay bills rent buy food. I can't sleep my thoughts keep spinning arround everything. I keep thinking about killing myself. Not only because I'm depressed AF but I don't want to end up on street. I can't find anything to hold on to. I've been suicidal before hell I tried to kill myself but this time is bad it is really bad.I lost all hope. I can't stand other people. I'm lost.,Bipolar
46319,Could psychiatrists diagnose teens with bipolar back in the late 90s early 2000s? Hey so I just crashed into depression hard and fast and it got me thinking when I was a teen and obviously showing signs of bipolar my parents would threaten to send me to a psychiatrist if I didn't smarten up. I always told them yes send me please I need help in fewer words and they would punish me. What I'm wondering is would it have done any good? I'm currently feeling extremely bitter towards them for not getting me the help I obviously needed setting me back years and resulting in a failed career but is that bitterness justified?Thanks for any input you guys can provide,Bipolar

46052,Scrambling amp struggling to cope... Hello! I'm new to Reddit in general and I'm really happy that this is a thing! I have been struggling to cope lately Bipolar II and anxiety and not a damn thing makes me feel better. I am in this constant state of emotional discomfort that manifests to the physical. I want to be left completely alone so I don't have to worry about the toll taken on myself and the people I love. I'm so focused on pushing people away I feel like I don't love anyone anymore...at least for right now. I try to avoid any sort of affection and I just feel like such an awful horrid person. My boyfriend is so supportive and I feel so guilty and angry with him for trying to help me because I'm tired of the help and I just want to give up. I've felt like a ghost for a while now why not be an actual ghost? My boyfriend just got his concealed carry permit and I just wish he could kill me.

Im two weeks I am set to speak in front of my entire school about my struggles with depression as a bigger part of an outreach day the school leadership is planning. I intend to discuss the struggle that is depression tell my personas story and finally send two big messages about mental illness to my school. Id like to first address those who may suffer from mental illness and help them to know that there can be hope. That I understand how much it forces you to feel worthless and isolate yourself but that if we all can learn to help one another we can begin to not be alone. The other is to address those who may hold a stigma against mental illness or simply dont know how to help at all. I would love it if yall here at rBipolarReddit could give me some feedback and overall relay to me what some of the most important things need to be addressed in regard to mental health.Heres a few questions to guide your feedback if youd like to answer them. If not feel free to share some thoughts and ideas with me itd be much appreciated. Love yall. Its hard. I know.As a person who suffers from mental illness what does it help to hear? What helps to give you hope?How can others help?Whats one thing you think people need to better understand about mental illness and bipolar disorder?What do you wish for in the future for the mental health community?What do you think I really need to relay to other people who may be suffering from mental illness?Thank you.

45719,Depression I usually have a couple of bad days a month on a lot of meds usually I have crying spells overwhelming sense of dread I hate myself and think Im a horrible person whos always and always will fuck up everything good in their life. Then it goes away pretty quickly.The depression Im experiencing has been a slow onset over a few weeks but has been really bad. My boyfriend says Ive been fucked since New Years idk know if I believe that maybe. I feel so god awful alone. I havent felt this alone in such a long time and my boyfriend just took me to pick out my engagement ring. My boyfriend doesnt get this sort of stuff and doesnt even try but Ive isolated myself so badly hes all Ive got to talk to Im convinced no one else cares and Im convinced he doesnt want to put up with my shit anyways. He gets very mad. I usually have to beg him to listen then when he finally does hell say things like dont do that just do what you have to do. I try to talk to him but he says all I do is tell him what he does wrong which in my opinion isnt accurate my only gripe with our relationship has been communication and always has been. Were bad at it together.I dont even know why Im writing this. Everything is such a fucking chore. I hate going to university Im in my mid twenties because I feel so alone. Like those movie scenes where the person is standing still but there are thousands of people moving around them very quickly. Like I know I dont have anything in common with the kids at school but since the depression has onset its only magnified how utterly alone I feel.I cant let go of the feeling that I fuck everything up. I have to beg my boyfriend to listen to me and thats always a fight. Ive missed assignments in school and I feel like Im trashing it really though nothing major not in danger of failing. Im just a piece of shit the same piece of shit Ive always been. I ruin every good thing I touch.I wish I didnt care that I had to beg him to care about me sometimes I think he is just more aloof than I am at any given time. I wish I could care less.I dont know. Ive been in tears all night and am having a horrible horrible time. I have homework to do but Id love to just take my medicine and knock out.I hate everything right now.,Bipolar

45853,Bipolar Boyfriend Hi everyone I'm new here so please go easy on me if I make a mistake.My boyfriend whom I've been dating for over one year has bipolar disorder. When we started dating he was in a hypomanic phase luckily he got out of it in a month or so instead of it escalating into full blown mania or another psychosis. He's had psychosis several times in his life and it's been difficult for him sometimes. He needs to take medication daily.I have some questions about certain behaviour and would like to know if this is common with people who have bipolar disorder.Being indecisive. He'll say one thing one moment and when he's with other people they'll be able to change his mind in a minute. He'll tell mepromise me one thing one moment but then completely abandon those promises and stop caring.It's very easy to talk him into doing something that he usually wouldn't have done on his own. I'm talking drinking way too much and suddenly just smoking when he quit smoking for months. He also has a hard time when I ask him about this type of behaviour or when I get upset.He used to be very sure about our future but ever since a couple of months ago he's been doubting things and he hasn't been sharing his feelings with me or telling me how he feels even when I ask him. He's tried to break up with me two months ago to which I said are you sure? Do you want to give it all up? Calmly and respectfully not mad and he ended up not breaking up with me. He's been threatening to break up with me again.He often gets really tired and sleeps till late afternoon he's been doing that for months. He lost motivation to look for a job as well. He had a job interview but he cancelled last minute last week. He was too anxious to go. I often feel as if he's just very insecure.He'll say that the reason he never responds when I'm talking to him irl is because he just can't think clearly and his mind is just blank. However I think this could be because he doesn't like to be confronted when he's lied to meI've never experienced him in a depressive manic state before and he doesn't feel anxious when he's outside he doesn't feel as if they're spying on him and stuff. Which he definitely did when he was experiencing hypomania. He believes the craziest conspiracies when he's actually manic so I don't know what this all means.It would help me if y'all could really enlighten me on this subject. I was hoping to talk to his therapist about this tomorrow but he has been ignoring me and suddenly is hanging out with friends he's out with one friend who's done hard drugs right now. He says he's never done harddrugs but this friend does get him to smoke and drink too much when they're out together.We had fights several times last week and yesterday but he is just refusing to make up ignoring me and instead just seeing his friends or he'll sleep over at his parents' place. Even though I don't live with him so he could just stay at his own place but he always feels the need to go to his parents which is why I think he's insecure. Any advice? What do I do and what do I say to him? It's been difficult for me to understand everything which is why I'm here. It's also been difficult because him changing his mind constantly is so confusing to me I never know what he actually wants because he'll constantly tell me something else.,Bipolar
45787,I had a rare win today. Ive been considering getting a new car for a while and recently I have been more and more obsessed and interested in it even though its really not an immediate need. I was bored and had an abnormal amount of free time today and im trending towards manic so I found myself driving to the dealership just look at this one I really liked. I had a plan. I told the sales guy straight up when I got there this is what Ill pay Im not paying any money today other than a straight trade and increasing my payment. Okay cool we have an understanding. So I drive the car its exactly what I thought it was and I really liked it. We go inside. I let him run my credit and talking about numbers. He comes back WAY more than what we already talked about and wanting a bunch of money down. I was clear It was too much but I still let him run back and forth to try something and see what we can do and I even started agreeing to pass my boundaries and give them a down payment which would have really hurt our savings and put us in a bad financial situation. I called my dad and I called my husband and basically had them talking me off a ledge because I told myself a thousand times like a mantra if it isnt the right deal Im not doing it. After 3 hours of then trying hard to pressure me I just told them I am leaving right now give me my keys. I was shaking and so uncomfortable and Im still surprised I got out of there without fucking myself financially.,Bipolar

45620,WarningIs this a Manic Episode? Please HELP xpost rbipolar I've been diagnosed with bipolar by three different psychiatrists. I kept asking for different opinions because I thought I was simply afflicted with major depression on and off for about a decade!.I've finally accepted the diagnosis and started the treatment but the pills that the doctor prescribed are exclusively to treat symptoms of depression in patients with bipolar disease Lamictal. For the past 5 days however I've been experiencing something very different Some of my thoughts seem foreign to me in the sense that I know they don't make sense but I am still drawn toconsumed by them. I do and say things that are completely outrageous. Even though I am perfectly aware that they are outrageous I somehow can't stop myself. It's very easy to trigger my irritability. I am screaming loudly and aggressively and using profanity at the slightest of provocations. I am vicariously living some fantasies. When I say vicariously I mean that I am having extreme reactions of nostalgia over things that never happened fake memories. It's strange in the sense that I know they are fake but at the same time I believe them?My head is a big mess. I don't have any answers. When I'm depressed none of this happens. Right now I feel like I have more than one person inside my head. There is the rational side the side that is aware that something is off the side that is writing this. And then there is the unbalanced side the side that is causing all this havoc.The only thing that seems to help is to go clubbing or to a place with a lot of noise. It somehow makes my thoughts more clear and leaves me more relaxed even without the help of alcohol.Has anyone experienced any of these things? I am scared but I end up driving away everyone that tries to offer their help. ,Bipolar

46463,Mental health road to recovery. Fuck. Me. Im new to reddit. My sisters been an active user for years. I finally decided to check it out. Little overwhelming with all the communities. I feel like I want to reach them all.Anyhow going through a mental health transition. Seeking help Ive felt that I needed for a long time now. I could only repress myself for so long. This last melt down completely broke me. My life that I created is in my eyes perfect. Ive worked so hard to have it all to not be my mom. And yet here I am in the shower tears blending with the water and my dog is scratching at the door to get in. But in that moment I wanted everything to stop. Even my heart. I pulled myself out of the shower. Looked in the mirror. Wiped my eyes and smiled. I couldnt convince myself I was ok but maybe I could to my husband. Got dressed went downstairs. Tried folding some laundry. Tried hiding. Tried holding back. But I looked at him and completely lost it. Immediately I made an appointment with my primary that week. From there I have now sought out a therapist and psychiatrist. Ive since tried new medications. Not to much help. How am I supposed to feel? Bipolar 2 is my official diagnosis. However I always mask and mask and mask and pretend. Im very high functioning. Before my meltdown I was the most manic Ive ever been. Reckless. Hyper sexual my husband loved that part. No sleep. Busy busy busy. What can I get into next? Whats going to keep me from crashing? Constantly on the go. And the second I withdraw in the slightest people are surprised. What do you mean you dont want to go out? You dont want to talk and socialize? Why are you being so anxious? BECAUSE THIS IS WHO I AM. Ive been so fucking good at keeping this up I trick myself. But only for so long. Other people I had convinced. Which brings me here. Im now trying another medication AND was told that marijuana isnt a great match for bipolar which is a fucking bummer. I love my maryjane. However I am dedicated and took my vows seriously. I want to be the best me wife daughter sister and friend I can be. This process is hard and challenging. I want to be open with those around me about this struggle. But for now I think I need to understand it myself before the outside world can get it. Well thanks for sticking around this long if your still reading. This journey is hard but worth it. Exhausting but rewarding. Everyone keep your head up. Its so fucking hard. But please do it for yourself. Youll make it through. Were all struggling together in different ways but we all have the same end goal. Keep fighting. ,Bipolar

46217,Im becoming hopeless Everytime my pdoc prescribes me a new med I immediately get online to see what side effects are the most common for a lot of people if they liked it how long it took to work etc. I know its anecdotal information but it eases my anxiety about new meds.And everytime I look there are people who say it doesnt work it made things worse but then there are also a lot of people that say its their miracle drug and it gave them their life back. I know everyone is different and it takes time to find the right combo of meds but Im so tired of getting my hopes up thinking maybe this time this one will work and so far it never has. People sing praises for Lamictal from the mountain tops and Ive been on it for months and the only effect its had is making me stupid. Rexulti made my existing sleep problems worse and unbearable hand tremors. SSRIs didnt work for obvious reasons. Latuda made me hypomanic. Ive been on 450mg of Wellbutrin daily for three years and it doesnt even keep me afloat anymore. I want to die every day and everything makes me cry. So now Im on Lamictal Wellbutrin and Im starting lithium but I dont want to take it in the first place because I doubt itll work and its incredibly high maintenance compared to every other option It seems. But Im taking it. Because I have to. And its not going to work again just like nothing else has.

Ive been tapering for a while now and Im at the arseend of it. I just need a med so Im tired enough to fall asleep but not too tired that I cant wake up enough the next morning. Also one so Im not too drowsy so I can function properly the next day and the kicker doesnt make me fat. People can walk on the moon but not invent this wonder drug for me. Why lol. ,Bipolar

46159,How do you cope with mixed hypomania? Help please,Bipolar
45517,Do you have phases? I do. I've noticed a structure and pattern of my phases as it relates to my level of brain activity from depression to hypomania. I hope sharing this will clarify these cycles for others. I have a lot of phases of interest. Sometimes they reoccur sometimes they're oneoffs. It's frustrating to be passionate about something and then stop. But I know it's because my moods change.I've come to some observations about my phases and even have a little theory about them although it may just be limited to my case. Here's the theoryMy phases fall into four categories. At the lowest level there is basic pleasures. Some basic pleasures I've had are baseball harry potter and Disney movies. Next there is high pleasure e.g. classical music jazz music and Shakespeare. Then I have phases of personal development losing weight learning musical skills learning Spanish. Finally I have the highest order of phases where I have a sense of duty I've become vegan and buddhist out of this level.I feel like these phases accord to a particular level of brain activity from low to high. I think everyone falls somewhere on this dimension at a given moment. I also think healthy people have a smaller average range of categories of particular interest some people skew basic to high some high to personal development some just are adept at acting on a sense of duty.At least in my case I run the full gamut. At a depressed level I have basic interests at a certain level of depression one my have NO interest but I don't get that low. At a hypomanic level I have a grandiose sense of duty. However I feel like I have a natural balance. I feel like I have an ideal scope like anyone else but I have no balance of brain activity. I feel at my most me when I am at a mix of high pleasure and personal development.I've also noticed a pattern of logical progression from disordered to ordered interest in my life. Say I start at my healthy level highdeveopment. When I approach a sense of runaway personal development I become grandiose about that development. Then I may achieve a personal sense of duty to apply that development. Of course my deveopment only goes so far and my sense of duty goes farther so I burn out. Then in a depressed mode I land in basic pleasure. With higher mood after building basic pleasures I grade them up to high pleasures from which point I have more confidence in my ability to develop related skills. The cycle restarts.This is very interesting to me but all I've really done is describe a pattern of disordered mood change in terms of its effects on human interest and concern and apply conceptions of general human interests and concern in doing so.But I actually think I have a lifestyle tip for myself based on this theory. I'm at the high level of the personal development stage right now and could approach an abnormal sense of duty. First of all by recognizing this generalized progression I can catch any slip ups early and so can my support circle. But what really interests me is how I can adjust my personal development habits toward a more healthy progression.Right now my personal development topic is math. Math is an extremely broad topic in terms of range of difficulty and scope. I could get frustrated with basic algebra or I could obsess over an unsolved problem way out of my league. But I think about another personal development habit I had weight loss.When I lost weight it was a development of daily regiment one where I ate a little less every day and gradually lost weight. Normally I have a seasonal peak of hypomania where I have that grandiose duty. After the regimented challenge of losing weight became difficult I went to a modestly fairly euthymic basic pleasure. The nature of the challenge didn't involve runaway progress because of how structured it was.Applying that lesson to my math development I could continue to over stress myself with difficult problems or I could make it a daily grind. I could even get a tutor to make sure I stay on a good track. Perhaps I wouldn't have to go to a toxic level of stimulation and go hypomanic and just cool off adding a daily practice to my life.Thinking this way has opened up some different options about how to deal with my moods as well as who I really am. I see my doctor tomorrow and I look forward to discussing these ideas with him.Note about high and low pleasures I didn't mean to call anyone's hobby high or low. I think it's completely relative. I think something high for me could be low for someone else. I strongly believe whether a pleasure is high or low at least in a mental health context depends on the kind of enjoyment one gets out of it. It's something one can really know if one really asks themselves and is honest.,Bipolar

46151,bipolar amp traveling amp manic episodes amp foreign psych ward !! Hi everyone. I wrote this about something I experienced last nightkind of what happened to me in my first psychotic manic episode or whatever you wanna call it. Did anyone else ever experience something like this? The sun was setting in the Guatemalan Western Highlands as I used some of my precious battery life to check how far I was on the map on my phone. Nearly three hours. Traffic had slowed to a crawl and I felt the telltale ticking of my anxiety rising in my stomach. This wasnt the plan my brain told me. It was supposed to still be light when you got there. Fear began to overwhelm me even though I had been in situations like this before. I had arrived only the night earlier in Guatemala City close to midnight. Its days like this my recent diagnosis as being bipolar began to make sense. I thought I heard the woman with her child talking on the phone on the bus saying something about rubia and fright overwhelmed me. I have become so scared of my own brain. In everything I do I question what symptom of bipolarity is this? While in Croatia last summer I was relaxed partying and feeling like for once I had come out of my shell I had become the person I was supposed to be. That bout of mania landed me in a Croatian psych ward. When I stopped punishing myself for the sexual assault I suffered when I was four and began to allow myself to be happy or so I thought I had a psychotic break. I heard people talking about me. First it was about how great I was how cool how pretty and it was flattering. I felt on top of the world. Then I heard the other hallucinations. They were not so flattering. I spent a night in a hostel crying while nearly 10 people in the same room tried to sleep. I felt terrible but I couldnt stop crying. I was hysterical. My hallucinations had made me believe I had been raped I had herpes I was tainted and disgusting and that I should probably kill myself because no one loved or cared about me. That night I spent in my head. I didnt sleep except for an hour but then I was woken up by the hostel staff and asked to leave my reservation was only for one night. I wandered around the city and I felt like everyone was talking about me. I wanted to cry or sleep or escape but I just didnt have the mental capacity to do any of it. I muttered and wandered. I felt so foggy like there was a weight on my mind. Why were people following me? Why couldnt I see them? The next two days are kind of blurs in my mind but I know I managed to leave all my belongings behind including my glasses and my ability to see have a delusion that I could speak every language I had ever heard a word of and start to become aggressive. The next clear memory I have I was waking up in a soft warm bed. It was dirty all around me and I felt so groggy and tired. I was in and out of sleep the whole day waking up occasionally to eat a meal. There was a layer of grime and shame on me that a cold shower couldnt get off. All I wanted to do was curl up in that bed and become an invalid. The delusions were still there but weaker.So when this perfectly friendly normal Guatemalan woman was simply having a conversation with her mother and I thought I heard words that might pertain to me it freaked me out. I have a mantra I internalize when I am projecting my fears onto speech around me no one cares about you no one is talking about you. It sounds pretty emo. But when I thought just for two minutes this Guatemalan woman was planning a way to rob me its extremely comforting. I went home after I ended up in the psych ward because clearly I needed to meet with psychiatrists and a whole host of doctors and a lovely therapist who would try to help me and have varying levels of success. Throughout this process my goal was to continue to travel by myself. I saw this as a hiccup. A pretty major hiccup but one thats able to be overcome with a cando attitude! It wasnt about or feeling like I had failed but an urging from deep in my motherfucking soul that told me if I stayed in the relative warmth and comfort of my parents house now I would never leave. Thats probably a symptom. ,Bipolar

45856,Diagnosis fear My family and boyfriend have been saying for years they think I have bipolar. I have written down all of the things I have felt recently and its overwhelmingly scary. I dont want a diagnosis I dont want to admit my mind works differently. I dont want to admit I think about death daily. When Im feeling high its amazing nothing can stop me and I feel I will succeed in everything. But just like that I can become extremely aggressive overly sad sobbing for hours and recently its becoming difficult to cope with. On so many occasions I can feel myself slipping away and this angry monster coming in to replace the high it destroys whats around me and I have no control over it. I dont know what to do or where to vent so here I am. ,Bipolar
45563,Best meds for me I guess Lithium was the best out of all the ones I took. Lithium 1200mg with either abilify or Latuda. Took it for about 5 years but it did make me...numb. I was just content with everything no matter how good or bad things were I was in a cloud where nothing really affected me. And it kinda sucked to be honest with you. Everyone around me was fine with me because I became this nice stable softspoken woman who never really complained about anything. Well I decided to come off my meds about a year and a half ago because I didnt want to live that way for the rest of my life. I wanted to feel again. Feel something anything. And long story short I quit my job because I realized I was miserable there lost some friends but gained some too. I have ups and downs but I can feel again. At least for now I wont be going back on meds. Fuck that. Anyone else decided to go off their meds and what has been your experience?,Bipolar

45995,Have been taking Lexapro 10mg for past 4 days. Feeling like my depression is gone since yesterday. Not sure if it's Lexapro or if it might be a hypomanic or a manic phase.Xpost from rdepression I'm not sure if crossposting is allowed. Here is the link to my original posthttpswww.reddit.comrdepressioncomments87a00bhavebeentakinglexapro10mgforpast4days on rdepression. TLDR Not sure what type of depressive disorderPDD Smiling Depression SAD Cyclothymia or Bipolar 2 I have. My psychiatrist started me Lexapro 10mg and based on how it goes he said we could try switching to mood support meds. I've been taking Lexapro since Thursday and I've been feeling like my depression is gone since yesterday. I'm worried I might be in a hypomanic or a manic phasegot told by my psychiatrist that Lexapro elevates the mania and asked me not to take it if I'm in a hypomanic or manic phase.I met my psychiatrist last Thursday and we talked about my depression. I've always had ups and downs in my life for a few years. But I always thought it was because of my actions that caused then and not the other way around. I'm still not sure what type of depressive disorder I have. Since I had like 2 weeks time before my appointment I did a bit of research reading about the depression types and how each of them is different in their own way. So I told my psychiatrist that I wasn't sure if had the persistent depressive disorder seasonal affective depression smiling depression or Cyclothymiaaka bipolar lite.When I was doing my research and if there was something relatable to me or if something similar has happened to me before I noted them down as a list. We talked about how I identified that I was depressed and all the points on the list. Then he told me that even he wasn't sure if I had Dysthymia smiling depression bipolar 2 or cyclothymia. So as a general procedure he said that he is going to prescribe me meds to help with depression and if it doesn't work he is going to prescribe me mood support meds for cyclothymia or bipolar 2. He prescribed Lexapro 10mg to take every morning and asked me to get back to him in 2 weeks about how the meds were working. He also warned me not to take Lexapro if I feel like I have a hypomanic or a manic phase as it might elevate the mania. I've been taking Lexapro since Thursday and I've been feeling like I'm not depressed since yesterday. I was not sure if it's my hypomanic phase and I didn't take my meds today.So these were the differences that I noticed in me yesterday compared to the day before I feel fresh more energetic and I feel like I got back my motivation to do things. I've been procrastinating to buy my vitamins for a week and I ordered them yesterday I still have vitamins for the next couple of days I smoked close to double the number of cigarettes than I did during the past few days I was clenching my jaw more than usual and today morning I had a little pain in my enamel I've been hitting my bed at 12ish and could sleep only by around 4 or 5 in the morning and I slept for around 4 hours for the past couple of weeks. I started using melatonin for last week and it helped me get to sleep by 12. I used to sleep for 10 to 11 hours on melatonin. But last night I didn't take melatonin. I went to bed at 12 and slept in a few mins and woke up at approx 8. I planned my family's trip to the US have been wanting to do this for weeks I could never stay interested in a single topic for more than 10 mins max. I watched the entire Dota 2 loregasm playlist by SirActionSlacks. It has 12 videos and it took around 3.5 hours to finish. I watched the whole thing without any break. I completed the tax return process on Sprintax. I still have to take a printout and mail it but I got my w2 and access to Sprintax like more than a month ago and I've been procrastinating to finish it. Finally I usually don't write this long posts if I'm not on Adderall diagnosed with ADHD but I'm not on Adderall now.I want to wait a couple of days to talk to my psychiatrist about this. Before that I just wanted to make sure if it's Lexapro or a hypomanic or manic phase.,Bipolar
45710,I took a shower and it was glorious Since the beginning of December I've been struggling with a couple of manic episodes. As the month went on I noticed a spike in my anxiety but it was around the holidays and I was able to get a handle on it for the most part with my Xanax prescription. After a negative experience with my father during the holidays my anxiety only increased until by January I couldn't get a handle on it. It developed in to full blown paranoia. I was and still somewhat am convinced I was being watched especially from the strip of woods behind my house. Every time my German Shepherd would let out a guard dog bark at the back door I would lose my shit. If I needed to go to the grocery store I would go either very early in the morning or very late at night when there would be virtually no one there. If I turned to go down and aisle and saw another person there I was overcome with a sense of uncomfortable dread and would wait in hiding until I saw them leave the aisle and go elsewhere. This lasted me all of January and I shamefully only showered maybe two or three times from the beginning of December to the end of January. I kept my hair tied up and didn't brush it unless I was going to shower. My first shower since maybe all of January or at least the middle of it and when I went to take my hair tie out it just kept getting more tangled. I had to have my fianc cut it out of my hair and when I tried to unwrap the bun it wasn't unwinding. I asked him to look at it and he was shocked and told me my hair was completely knotted together. Luckily he was able to untangle it without having to take scissors to it. And let me tell you even with a detangler brush the layer of knots on top and underneath my hair were RUTHLESS. My hand cramped up during it and my eyes may have teared up a couple times but I got through it. Unfortunately for the past week and a half I did not shower and did not brush my hair. Same results as far as my fianc having to cut out another hair tie and unknot my hair but that shower was HEAVENLY! I got the shampoo super lathery and just scrubbed every inch of my scalp. Then I let a deep conditioner sit while I washed my body and was able to do a second wash after I rinsed the conditioner and used my medicated body wash for my body acne chest back and even upper arms! I put all my products in my hair about 8 totally I believe and exfoliated my face and neck and put on a super moisturizing mask before doing my normal skincare routine. I'm going through a manic episode now and was up all night but I was able to take a shower and get ready early enough to actually be on time for once since my best friendMaid of Honor was coming over so we could go to my mom's and get my Save the Dates addressed and ready to finally send out seeing as they were supposed to be done end of Decemberearly January. I also did 4 hours worth of much needed cleaning and decluttering. I feel very accomplished and refreshed but at the same time a little invalidated because most of this most likely wouldn't have gotten done if I wasn't manic. Still my hair is soft my skin is glowing and my Save the Dates are finally done! Hopefully after my appointment with my psychiatrist on Tuesday I can get on the road to getting my moods and emotions to a manageable level. If you read this I hope you are having a wonderful day and know this illness doesn't own you!,Bipolar

45877,Hypomanic rage Looking back at every argument I've ever had with my partner I blame about 85 of them on being untreated and hypomanic and irritable and full of rage. And no matter what I started the argument for it always ended the same way I would get angry at my partner for not talking and thinking as fast as I was the reason for the argument completely forgotten my anger just grabbing at straws until I was essentially getting angry at my self for having such debilitating racing thoughts and flight of ideas but I was directing it all at my poor wonderful partner. I'm curious as to what other bipolar 2 people feel in regards to anger irritability and rages. I know for a fact that when I get snippy I'm hypomanic and probably going to try and start an argument. Hypomania in me is not the fun happy high that it can be sure I'm up there in energy and a little bit excited but I am not elated I am angry. How about you guys? ,Bipolar

My therapist and psychiatrist are basically saying I need to talk to the other about it Oh you need to talk to her about adjusting your meds oh you need to talk to the therapist about different strategies and not really helping me deal with it at all.

46124,Does anyone not want to get better? I saw my psychiatrist today and she prescribed me Wellbutrin for my crippling depression. I'm currently taking 150 mgs and 200 mgs of Seroquel. I'm kind of anxious that the new med will help me as strange as that might sound.I don't want to get better anymore. I have given up on life. I've come to accept that I'll never be happy and I don't want to be anymore because it won't last. It's foolish to seek happiness because it just ends with more hurt and pain. All I wanted for a long time was someone to love me. I thought I found that person. We were going to get married. He left me 3 months to this day... what would have been our two year anniversary is in less than two weeks.I see no point in pursuing another relationship. Why go through the pain all over again? Why get my hopes up just to be crushed and thrown away like the trash I am? I'm not hung up on him. I fucking hate him he was a horrible piece of shit and our relationship was toxic as fuck. But that was our thing. Lord knows I'm not the best person either. It happens.I really don't know what to do with myself anymore. I gave up on all of my dreams. I've become extremely misanthropic and only leave the house to go to my appointments. I wish I would just commit suicide and get it over with.Everyone thinks I'm depressed but I'm not. I think this is a perfectly reasonable reaction to everything I've been through which this is just the tip of the iceberg and I'm not going to detail every horror that has made up my existence and broke me as a person. My fiance leaving me was just the last straw. I can't possibly endure any more suffering in my life which is why I've cut myself off from other humans except for my family.,Bipolar
46371,Weird hypomania or am I just an idiot? Ever since my diagnosis 2 years ago I've gotten pretty good at recognizing my hypomanic symptoms...after the fact at least but more than a few times I've had experiences where I just have one maybe two symptoms for a week or two then one or two days that might actually qualify as something. Uniformly it's pleasurablerisky behavior being more goal oriented. I have pretty high self esteem all the time unless I'm depressive so I can't use it to judge unless it's gotten to the point where I think about running for office or starting a cult that's pretty obviousI don't get flight of ideas sleeplessness distracted pressured speech etc during these times. When I'm full blown hypomanic I get at least 50 of the above.So what does this mean? Is it hypohypomania? Am I just making stupid or rash decisions?,Bipolar

46236,On Therapy My therapist is very talented. In fact she was booked for the entire month of December and for all but the last week of this month. That means it'll be almost two months between appointments when I'm used to seeing her twice a month. This has never happened in our quite lengthy time together and I'm scheduled through March from here on out.Therapy is an interesting thing for me. Because I come from a very traumatic background therapy has been a godsend for PTSDrelated issues. What I'd never noticed before though is how much it helps me regulate my mood in between sessions. Knowing I'll have someone to help me sort through random thoughts and make sense of any major shifts or psychotic issues allows me to keep the jumble in the background. It's like static I can tolerate the static when I know there will eventually be someone who can help me understand how the radio works. bad example but best I can do.My therapist pdoc and I constantly assess whether therapy is beneficial to me because it has been ongoing for quite some time. We were all of the understanding that yes in fact I get a great deal of benefit from therapy. Now I'm one month into not having therapy and things are falling absolutely apart. Suspicion confirmed.I will go on through this month doing the best I can and I will try not to break any more aspects of life. Then I will spend a couple of sessions picking up the pieces and hoping this sort of break in our therapy journey does not happen again anytime soon.,Bipolar

45565,New to Bipolar A close family member of mine just got diagnosed with bipolar this summer after experiencing a major manic episode. Is there anyone who has advice or tips for learning more about this condition or things you wish you knew early on that might have helped you to deal with your symptoms better? If there are any resources that can be recommended all information would be appreciated. The biggest issue is sleep right now and I feel like my family member is obsessing over it to the point that they can't see the progress that they are making and I just want to know how I can help. They feel numb to emotion and at times hopeless and I wan't to know what I can do or how I can help them help themselves.Thank you,Bipolar
45410,As a woman in my early twenties how do I build my trust in men and confidence in romantic relationships? Just in need of some advice. I am finally doing quite well dealing with being bipolar II diagnosed a year ago but I am finding some issues that are making themselves more apparent as I lean back in to the dating scene. Not only do my mental health issues make me nervous going into a relationship but I am noticing I have some real trust issues. My father was an alcoholic most of my life and was not present very often. I have not had many men in my life that I have been able to fully trust. I know where my trust problems come from but I am having trouble working on these issues. Anytime I meet a new guy and things are great as soon as they mention a good friend that is a girl my stomach just drops and I begin wondering if I can trust them. My first serious boyfriend also ended up dating his good friend right after we broke up and I think that is kinda adding to this thought spiral.I guess Im asking how can I come to terms with the fact that a guy could be unfaithful? Because of course I can never know for sure. How do I deal with that possibility without it making me push the person away out of fear? I get the worst feeling in my body just thinking about being in a relationship with someone and finding out that they secretly are very attracted to their friend that they just cant be with for whatever reason. Please help I want to have a positive relationship in my life but I am getting in the way of that. ,Bipolar
45763,My schools disability resources is being a butt and I dont have the energy to self advocate After a decade of dealing with mental health professionals Ive learned how to be my own self advocate. There were times when I felt my pdoc was dismissive and I had to stand up for myself to make myself heard. It can be so hard because in the end theyre usually just trying to help and I feel bad for being almost confrontational. Ive learned what situations you should badger an office and when you shouldnt. This is the shit you learn when you deal with this bullshit disease. And I need to badger my schools DR right now. For some reason they havent granted me excused absences which I had no issue getting at previous institutions and those are so much more important than getting extended testing time...And I know how it looks. I KNOW. It looks like I want a legitimate way to slack off but that isnt what happens. I did my best to not abuse those previous accommodations because they were my saving grace at the end of the semester. Im not completely incompetent. I can follow the syllabus text classmates and do my best to keep up with the class materials. But sometimes I just cannot leave my bed.So much has gone wrong this past month. Life has just taken a huge shit on me at the beginning of this semester and I need help. I have an established relationship with a psychiatrist in this new town but I need a therapist. She gave me a list and Ive been playing phone tag with her top recommendation and I just cant anymore. I dont have the energy. Im here by myself away from family freaked out by my creepy neighbors and just struggling in general. The only two things I can focus on are my schoolwork and taking care of my dog. And everyday I feel like Im failing at even that. My house is a mess. Im a mess. My eating habits are horrible. I feel the temptation of hard alcohol everyday... so I binge eat then starve then binge. Luckily my alcohol consumption hasnt gotten out of control tho I am planning on cutting it out completely again. I thought discussion questions were due at midnight on Sundays but theyre due at 8 pm. I had confused between two different classs deadlines. My prof has been so understanding but god I need to show Im not trying take advantage of any slack she has given me. Shes been so great at balancing having compassion but not coddling me. I really like her. And Im just asking for this one thing from my school. Their department is a fucking mess. My psychiatrist had dealt with them before and said she needs to be contacted by them first before writing any sort of letters detailing why I need this accommodation. I told this to the DR but they insisted that wasnt the case. So I call my psychiatrist and she insisted that thats how its always been and wont write anything until shes contacted by them. Then my assigned counselor sent me a passive aggressive email that the recommendation I had sent in did not explain why I needed an ESA. Shit lady I was not asking for a fucking emotional support animal! Get your fucking shit together. Family connections can be great tho my mother works at the university and knows the chair or director or what fucking ever of the DR and insists that I call him and go over the counselors head. But god I just do not have the energy. I dont have the energy for any of this. Sometimes I wish I was still a minor so my mom could just make my appts for me. For the first time in years I just want my mom to take care of me like she used to. I dont want to be responsible for dealing with this shit. Im being kept awake by my racing heart rate being brought on by my anxiety. Im all out of clonazepam until at least Wednesday. I had two beers left over and self medicated just to calm down a little but when I lay my head down all I can hear is my racing heart. I need help. I know how to ask for it. Where to find it. But god I just dont have the energy... The short days are even harder to deal with here due to the fucking freezing temperatures. Everything is so much harder when its this cold. Im just in this stupid self pity party where Im just asking why me???? Im really sorry for the length. I just dont have anywhere to turn right now. ,Bipolar
46014,My job has become too much. What do I do next? I work at a coffee housebar. I've been in there for almost five years. I've even been told I'm a crucial part of the team and promoted to assistant manager. I like certain parts of my job restocking getting everything in order before the end of my shift making drinks coffee amp booze flexible hours I work 34 days a week.For the longest time I also loved the company culture. They seemed to really care. And I love most of my coworkers and they've become close friends. But lately it seems like the company doesn't care at all and besides making me feel undervalued my day to day experience is also incredibly stressful. Management has made this job pretty toxic and I've been super depressed for months maybe I would've been otherwise but the focus of most of my depressive thoughts has been my shitty work environment.I'm feeling really ready to leave this job but I'm also terrified about what to do next.I don't really like dealing with people all day. I've gotten by this long at my job without losing my shit mostly by being the utility player and spending more effort keeping things running smoothly while other coworkers do more of the small talk that I find so emotionally taxing. But if I can avoid it I'd rather not go into another customer service job.I've considered so many different careers and I've gotten pretty enthralled with each idea for a time amp then talked myself out of every one. I've seriously considered nursing social work teaching and making toystheatrical puppetsart directing sort of deal. I just don't know what I can do that'll give me the time off I need to function while being fulfilling and not emotionally draining. Do you have any advice on selecting jobscareers? I'm just feeling so overwhelmed by the prospect of making these decisions but I don't feel like I have the luxury to put off these decisions any longer because this job has really gotten to the point of pushing me over the edge.,Bipolar
46262,New here and seeking advice Ive been on a mix of 1mg Clonazepam 75mg of Venlafaxine Effexor and 200mg of Lamictil god I hate spelling these for about ten years now. I had a suicide attempt about four or five days ago now. While I was in there a psychiatrist decided to take me off of the Effexor and onto Latuda 40mg instead. Is there anything I should expect? I typically drink 34 times a week though I wont be for awhile and smoke pot everyday. Today was my second dose and Im afraid to go outside or do anything until I know how this affects me. Im sick bipolar II and I truly want to get better. Any advice you guys can offer me? I found this sub late last night while searching for other resources. This seems to be a place that I can speak freely and get legitimate answers. Thank you all. ,Bipolar
45598,Sleeptalking and Restlessness with Bipolar Disorder? I've struggled with Bipolar Disorder for years. I'm almost 20 and I notice a lot that I end up sleep talking. I've had a couple occasions where I wake up in the middle of the night and I start having a conversation with one of my friends just like I would do at any other point in the day. I would feel like my friend is sitting in the chair in the corner of my room just having a conversation with me in the dark and I will wake up and talk for a couple of minutes what it seems like at least before I seem to pull out of it and freak out a little when I realize that it wasn't real.It gets WAY worse when my boyfriend sleeps over at my apartment. When I used to stay at my ex's house as well I remember sleeptalking over there.When my boyfriend slept over last week I had at least 4 instances within the night of tossing and turning where I started having nightmares and then talking through them. There were a couple points in the night where I woke up and shook my boyfriend on the shoulder and started talking to him like he was my old best friend Shelby. I began talking to Shelby about how our friendship had been on the rocks but we should try and be best friends again. He was mostly sound asleep and wrapped his arms around me and I remember thinking Oh that's not Shelby right before I fell back into a short but deep sleep.It happened with another nightmare that same night I woke up crying and saying I don't know why you would do this why did you have to do that? Why did you cheat on me? You know loyalty is so important to me because in my dream I guess my boyfriend had been unfaithful or something and I was in the inbetween of asleep and awake and I started lecturing my veryfaithful boyfriend on why he dreamcheated on me lol. But after a minute of talking to him he's a heavy sleeper so he didn't really fully listen right away to what I was saying I snap out of it almost every time even just a little bit and realize that I wasn't actually having a convo with anyone.It's a really bizarre scenario and it's happened a few times.Another one I can specifically think of included sleep walking and sleep talking at my ex's house. I started having a fullon conversation at 3 am after having been sound asleep and I started talking about how I wanted to watch the movie School of Rock idk why haha. It's hard because it's not a fullon sleeptalking I don't think. I have a weird experience where in the moment I am aware that I am having a conversation even though I think my body is about 10 aware that the people I am talking to are just from my dreams. It's so strange. I'm sorry if this is confusing but if anyone has any experience with intense amp regular sleeptalking please do share!!,Bipolar

45976,How do you know if your emotions are real? Hello BP2 here. This might tap into a more philosophical topic but I can't tell the difference between my actual emotions and my mental disorder. Being BP2 its hard to tell whether I'm actually motivated and happy for once rather than hypomanic. The depressive episodes are easy to tell apart from reasonable sadness because I've suffered from severe depression before my BP symptoms manifested so I can tell the signs more easily. But with mania I just don't know. I can never tell when I'm actually getting better or if I'm just being hypomanic. I don't know if I'm actually genuinely excited about life because I've finally gotten a handle on my mental illness or if my mental disorder is just playing tricks on me and secretly transitioning me into a hypomanic episode. I feel like I'm going crazy having relapsed multiple times over the years.So I guess my question is can you tell the difference between genuine emotion and your regular BP symptoms? If so how?,Bipolar

45538,Recently diagnosed with bipolar and I'm confused. My psychiatrist rediagnosed me with Bipolar NOS. I was misdiagnosed for four years. I'm still questioning if I actually have bipolar though because anxiety is my main problem. I haven't really experienced full on maniaatleast I don't think I only get very irritable and talk fast randomly for a short period of time. I get depressed for about a month then I'm fine. I can see some small signs but nothing that jumps out as being apart of bipolar. I guess I just don't understand yet. I don't know. Btw My official diagnoses is bipolar social anxiety generalize anxiety and panic disorder.,Bipolar
46384,New to reddit please forgive my possible lack of etiquette My SO in recovery from substance abuse goes through episodes of depression quite frequently. Usually at night and leading to suicidal thoughts andor ideation. I want to help her so bad but I don't know how. She lives in a sober house where most medications that have worked for her in the past are not allowed and if she were to take them on the low she would be evicted outright. I don't know what I would do if anything were to happen. I trust her to call someone before it escalates to an intolerable level but shit if I'm not still worried for the girl. Please... I want to be strong for her but I'm terribly inexperienced and unequipped to give her any real advice. ,Bipolar
45934,3.5 years diagnosed 1 official year off meds.. I was diagnosed right after losing my mother at 18. When initially diagnosed I got put on a cocktail of meds hoping something would work. I was watched closely to try and figure out the cycle of my mood swings. I had a regular therapist and a psychiatric nurse I saw every week trying to figure it out. I stuck with it until a year and a half ago and decided being on a fluctuating list of medsthat may or may not workhave ugly side effects sucked. Until a year ago I was in a pretty toxic relationship too of course half of that due to myself. I had no idea what bipolar was or what it meant until I was diagnosed. Ive since been diagnosed with GADgeneralized anxiety disorder and PTSD to top it off. I have a vicious rapid cycle from manic to depressive and stable periods in between which Ive been able to prolong. As stupid as it sounds changing my dietless caffeinesugarheavy foods having a schedule and sleeping more regular has done fucking wonders for my ability to function. Everyday is still a damn challenge but I lost my mom to this disorder and Im not going to let it have me too. I refuse. P.S. A hearty salute to everyone still trying to figure out their own medical cocktail that will allow them to deal with this shit maybe just a bit easier... you guys rock. ,Bipolar
45731,More Trouble Than I'm Worth Without going into much detail here's a little contextHappily as much as BPD allows married to a wonderful man and we have a beautiful brilliant toddler. They're so good tofor me I often feel undeserving. I've been in a depressive episode for almost 2 months med compliant have been for 3 years. Lately I've been fucking up little typical people things scratched the car got scammed out of 300 letting food go bad in the fridge... They're hitting my selfworth hard for no other reason than my low threshold for disappointment and my high expectations of myself. The latest thing is a creepy message left on my front door on Valentine's Day saying they saw me in the area and wanted to leave their numberFacebook in case they never saw me again.... WTF. Of course my husband is pissed and I feel like my privacy has been 100 violated. Husband is SO upset that he has a hard time seeing how this affects me but besides that I feel like I'm way more trouble than I'm worth. My constant emotional turmoil the fatigue prescription drug costs migraines that make me worthless for hours. I feel like I should just be alone. Like the people I love shouldn't be subjected to my bullshit and have to clean up my messes or pay my debt when I die just got denied life insurance for BPD diagnosis. I have a lot of supportive people in my life family friends therapist. Regardless I can't shake this worthlessness selfloathing guilt.

45725,Woke up and didnt recognize myself i was diagnosed a few months ago as BP II with OCD and unspecified anxiety disorder. it took me a long time to seek help even though ive been dealing with these things for a very long time. looking back most of my life seems so foggy because of the constant up and down racing thoughts intrusive thoughts and anxiety meltdowns. even so i never really noticed the signs of something as serious as BP II. im only on 75 mg of lamictal and 50 mg of sertraline right now but im going back to my pdoc because i just had easily the worst hypomanic episode yet. maybe its just because i can recognize it now i dont know. either way i went on a total spending spree made 3 road trips in a two week period got my first 2 tattoos had unprotected sex w a guy i barely know have never had sex outside a relationship drank like a fish drove drunk and my mom even described me as arrogant. these things would all seem normal for a college student like myself if it werent for the fact that on a normal basis i am very very straight laced. i woke up monday morning and had to make my first gyno appt because i thought i was pregnant but instead i am being tested for stds. i hate the second tattoo i got because its visible all the time. im in a mess with the people i went out with because the alcohol turned me in an irritable mess. my bank account has barely enough money to buy groceries now. i dont know who i was these past few weeks but im scared of the place she put me in. how do i move past this?tldr my first recognizable hypomanic state made my life a shit show to the point where i felt like i was a completely different person. I dont know how to pick up the pieces ,Bipolar
45833,Lamictal Withdrawal Experiences Hi there. I've been trying to find out about people's experiences getting off Lamictal. I've been on a road getting off meds for a while now with the doc's approval. I got off some clonazepam and then moved on to Lamictal. As I mentioned I've gotten off things before but this last one really has me freaked out. It's been 5 weeks and I'm still exhausted. It's not every day but most days and I get dizzy still. It just seems with everything else that I've gotten off of that given some time you have a slope effect of things generally getting better over time. This is the first time where if it is the withdrawals it doesn't seem to be getting better as quickly as I would think and kind of getting worse. I'm looking into other things such as Lyme which actually could be a possibility but was wondering if anyone else had a case of a longer withdrawal time with Lamictal or something that you thought was harder than you might have thought in the first place? Or just any thoughts? It's really dragging me down. I'd really appreciate it and hope that everyone is feeling well! Thanks and take care.,Bipolar
46422,Idk if Im manic but Im not doing well I dont know if Im manic or whats going on. I was super stable for about 2 months. Very motivated productive going to sleep early and waking up early etc. I think it slowly ramped up to the point where I was out of the house doing school work or going to the gym or eating out or working like 16 hours a day making big plans etc. Everything seemed really beautiful and i think around that point I started to realize I was manic. Then this past week or two Ive begun drinking and smoking every night if Im sober I feel like buzzing out of my skin. Ive been hungover for days and I think Im acrually getting the flu now. The thing is I dont exactly feel manic anymore but I dont feel depressed either. Im not out being productive like I was at the beginnings of the episode I generally feel more on edge and tense? Like instead of having a bunch of positive energy i have more intense or stressed energy? I cant eat more than a few bites of anything with out getting nauseas even if I smoke and get the munchies. Im eating maybe like 500 calories a day not including alcohol. I cant sleep unless I smoke. The other day I worked 8 hours went out drinking all night slept for 4 hours and then went back and worked an 8 hour shift. I took a test still drunk from the night before and got a 92. Im going to the gym every other day just because I like the communal energy. I dont really know what Im getting at here. I guess I just feel sick as fuck from drinking all week and barely eating. But despite feeling sick I still feel like going out and being social. But I dont feel all positive and motivated like I did at the beginning? Idk whats going on.,Bipolar

45735,Lowering the doses of my meds fairly mild triggers For most of my life I have been on huge doses of a lot of medications which made me slow clumsy and stupid. I am not like any of those things naturally. I have been terrified of changing anything because it almost always leads to suicidal urges and self harm. When my previous psychiatrist changed me from risperdal to geodon I had a manic episode that lasted several months. I ended up in the hospital 5150 suicide attempt lots of cutting. When she put me on serroquel I had such bad vertigo and extreme sedation that I stumbled into a wall and broke my nose.I changed to a new psychiatrist about 3 months ago. She wanted to to start reducing my meds. I was willing to try because of the effing side effects and also the fact that the meds don't begin to control my symptoms.We lowered lamictal waaaay too fast long story. I was off it for about 2 weeks after taking 400mg a day for many years. I just went nuts when it was all out of my system. I felt suicidal urges that seemed uncontrollable and like I might try though it was against my will. I cut myself up. My dearest husband has worked from home for the last 3 weeks keeping me safe. I'm now on 100mg of lamictal and I'm hypomanic. I feel awesome. Everything has calmed down and this dose feels good. I'm more alert and I have some energy. I'm scared about what it will be like to reduce some of my other meds but I want to do it. Has anybody else had trouble changing meds or doses of meds? Is my body just freaky? These last few weeks have been hell. Sorry this is so long!,Bipolar
45512,Not bipolar. Asking for advice about my daughters mother who is bipolar. Hi. Need to clarify that I am using my wife's account to ask this question. I'm not a person who likes or enjoys social media I'm an old fart so please understand I'm only borrowing her account for this. Thank you. I hope someone can help me out with something I need to know. When my ex daughters mom is dealing with a common cold or flu she tends to go into almost a bipolar mania with borderline psychotic actions. She lashes out verbally and sadly physically. Last time a week ago she physically went after our 10 year old daughter. I had to drive to her house after my daughter called me terrified locked in the bathroom as her mother was kicking at the door. I have my daughter now getting her therapy and have a 3 year no contact order for my daughter and I against her mother. So when my ex gets sick with normal winter illnesses why does she spiral downward like this.? Then she blames anyone and everyone that it was there fault. My daughter was asked if she could go and get her mother a glass of water and my daughter said ok but could you please wait a few minutes so I can finish up my last bit of homework. Normally anyone would be ok thank you but not my ex. She started breaking things and basically telling our daughter that she doesn't care about mom and doesn't care about mom being sick and then into saying what did I ever do to you to make you hate me just a glass of water and you couldn't even be responsible and respectful enough to go get it. Now my daughter is not a child that yells back or gets defiant yet lol she's at least 2 years away from the hormones and my daughter is very soft spoken and would help anyone who asked. Complete opposite of my ex thank the heavens. Plus my ex goes off and on meds for the last 14 years. She says she doesn't have a problem and if she did meds cure it and ya da all gone. Please help me understand the correlation between bipolar and coldsflus with a person who cycles back and forth and refuses meds then goes back on for roughly a month no more than that every few years. Thank you Update edit For the record I don't plan on keeping the PFA order no contact for 3 years. That's what the judge ruled. I just wanted it for 3 months but with supervised visits for a few weeks leading into an actual custody order for my ex to have our daughter 5050. But because ex was arrested swinging at a cop and it was neighbors who called unbeknownst to me until the next day the judge ruled this way. Yes I wanted to just get her out of my daughters life because I was extremely angry for a few years. It was for me. Not my daughter. It was so I could feel better. Thanks to my wife she's changed my view on how it shouldn't be a selfish want or desire. I had to think about my daughter AND my ex and how it wouldn't be a good thing for either of them if I stopped their relationship. So I apologize to everyone on here for being a jerk. My wife said I was being one lol ,Bipolar
46349,Woes of getting in as a new patient I'm just so frustrated been off meds about a year and a half been stable moved to a small city and away from a crappy hospital but away from from my established medical resources. I called the largest provider here as of January 17th they're booked into mid April! Place I'm waiting to hear back from is only a couple months out hoping to get in earlier simply because I'm already diagnosed and have records of previous medications. I just don't get it yeah I should have done this sooner but I was stable if not slightly elevated but I'm trying to stay ahead of this before my depression gets deadly serious 2 previous hospitalizations. The second place I called only has one Psychologist and one nurse I forget the abbreviation but able to prescribe however I had a bad experience last time with a similar situation interestingly enough on my second hospitalization I was being cared for by the Dr that had the nurse as his assistant and he was not too impressed with the meds she had has been trying as I was not improving she'd actually prescribed ssri for me and he explained that that is about the last thing I should be taking anyways. It's just so frustrating for me trying to get the help I need as much as I had bad side effects from my last meds I'd rather have them than go through this damn suicidal roller coaster again! Thanks for reading and letting me get some of this out. ,Bipolar
45571,Tips for Severe Depression? Hello!I've been in a very suicidal depressive cycle for about two months now and I'm just...stuck. I have some coping mechanisms that work for my usual level of depression but nothing seems to be helping this time. I'm making sure I eat semiregularly taking my meds getting sleep and trying to keep myself distracted with old hobbies even if they're not enjoyable it does take my mind off things for a bit.

45777,Does this sound bi polar??? This all started last year when I started to feel really sad and depressed but here was no reason for it and then after six months I wouldn't feel it at all. I would feel like I'm on top of everything and I was doing really well in school. And now it kind of feels like it's happening again. But slowly creeping in on me. Like my grades are going down I sleep more. I have become way more selfdestructive and impulsive when it comes to my friendships and I can be just sitting at my computer looking at stuff and feeling content and instantly just go to sadness and pointlessness and the only way I feel like I can get rid of this is to go to sleep. Because when I wake up it's like my mood resets and I try to keep myself busy from my thoughts because they get really deep and depressive really fast.

And since I've been medicated I haven't had any kind of significant mood swings. Except I do still have minor mood swings but nothing like before and I'm wondering if I'm actually borderline instead. So my question is how well do meds work? Will they always keep me truly stable 100 of the time? Is it normal to get into an episode while medicated? Thanks!,Bipolar

One sentence version I started a class at night school and am looking for a place to study outside of my house.Version with pertinent information I just started school to get my real estate license. I'm really proud of myself for taking it on haha but I have run into a problem. Like so many here I dont sleep well and pretty much never at night. I go to class in the evening get out about 1030 go to the gym then come home. At this point I'd normally waste the rest of the night on the internet but now I have serious studying to do. I live with my parents so Im confined to my room at night for light and sound reasons. The thing is I'm finding it very difficult to study there because it's not fun to do and I am surrounded by entertainment options! I do really well at the library but it's obviously closed in the middle of the night and I'm having a hard time getting up early enough to get there before class. I've been sleeping from about 10am to about 3pm.I'm trying to be a big boy and just have some will power but I figured I'd see if you guys have any ideas of places that I could study at night?

Every day there I feel like dropping everything and walking out the door but I care too much for my managers.,Bipolar

45959,Therapy suggestions? On and off meds. Hopelessly in love with my exbestie. Hey so I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions of helpful therapies? I've done the standardbasic kind of therapies and it's just not helping. I have a kickass Psych who has me on a good medication set up right now. I've been going on and off my meds sometimes I forget to pick them up for too long or can't afford them every once in awhile. The guy I was seeing threw me head over heals and quickly became my best friend as well as a serious love. Unfortunately we aren't talking right now long story I'll spare you the details and I just can't get over it. I've been trying for a few months and can't get the loss of a love AND bestie through my head enough to accept it. I'm happy for him that he's found someone else and all but I'm still getting panic attacks obsessive thinking and really deep lows. I'd like to not be as reliant on my meds as I've need to be. So that's why I'm looking for maybe some alternative therapies. Has anyone had luck with therapies like hypnotherapy outpatient intensive or anything else??? Even done at home things that have been beneficial??,Bipolar

45444,Three strikes and out Had total of four treatments. Recovery from each was progressively worse. Paranoia anxiety extreme memory loss to the point I couldn't recognize wife or children. Ended up in locked room as the paranoid me became the angry me. I knew something was wrongs I literally felt short circuited and lashed out at staff doctors and family. My first and really only memory of this time was ripping plumbing off the sink as I prepared to combat staff? as I wanted the hell out of the nightmare I was living. As crazy as it sounds that was a beginning of my recovery. Today I'm stable but have lost big chunks of memories. Events one normally would never forget. Getting married birth of children paing of family members much less the little events of life that connect so much of who we are. I thank God I had an advocate in my wife that was able to say enough. The docs kept saying just one more just one more. Today I'm stable and my BP is under control through meds. Don't take this treatment lightly. It can have ramifications far and long that aren't always positive. Best of luck T. ,Bipolar
46077,Near death experience that wasnt real So Im bipolar if that wasnt obvious from the getgo and I was coming home from a trip with my Mom on a plane. I had a really amazing weekend and I was feeling happy but not manic but then I started getting very sad for no reason on the way home just assumed it was another mood swing. Then I had an extremely bad delusion where I was convinced that the plane was going to crash and we were all going to die. I was laying my head on my Moms shoulder I told her I loved her and I just silently cried while thinking about how this is the calm before the storm. In my head I was telling myself I cant believe were all about to die and IM the only one who knows. I actually accepted death and embraced it not in a suicidal way in a way that I had never ever done before and it was like I finally felt at peace. I had emotions that I had never come close to. When we experienced turbulence I closed my eyes and thought this is it this is when it happens and waited for the screaming and the overhead announcements. I thought of the baby crying and how it never got to experience its life and how my mom would never finish her book how my sister would react when she found out her closest family had died. After we landed safely I felt a weird mix of disappointment and relief. I didnt want to die but I had expected it to happen so much it felt wrong that it didnt. After that I got that postdelusion state where everything kind of feels like a dream for awhile. But now I feel like I had a neardeath experience that wasnt real and Im not sure how to move on from it. I feel like I shouldve gone down with that plane and now life just seems a little off. ,Bipolar
46111,BP1 Lithium 4 weeks It's been 1 month since starting lithium I last seen my psychiatrist on day 18 she said that I have responded well which at the time I agreed with although I did say that I feel a little on the flat side she said we might have to put the dose up but she will make that decision next time I see her Unfortunately in the 4 or 5 days ago my head has gone cloudy and I feel agitated i did have some mania as well i was just starting to get some relief to after a major 5 month long episode also RLS is back which was caused by trying to start a drug called latuda which was 2 months ago Would it be possible that my lithium levels just dropped for no reason? I know they were at 0.57 my psychiatrist said that's about where they need to be btw I take 900mg lithium carbonate SR .. Also can someone tell me this crawling feeling at the back of my legs will I ever be able to go on a low dose of Seroquel for sleep again?Thank you,Bipolar
46015,Now that I'm finally balancing out I'm terrified how much of my life has passed and how bad I screwed things up It's been a long road but I've finally begun to get some normalcy in my life. I really went down the tubes for a while a long while and I made a lot of decisions that have left my old life way in the past. I feel like I have a twin old life me who had the life I wanted to have. Then it all fell to shit. Then there's current me the remaining other twin who's life is well crap. I mean I'm a loser not being down I just am. The thing that really freaks me out though is when I look back so much time has passed yet I feel stuck in cement going nowhere. I had suicidal ideation for years bad and that's gone away lately. Which is cool. I actually want to live again only problem is I can't shake the horror of all the time that's passed and how bad I fucked everything up and how low I have sunk. Anyone else deal with this? I'd love to hear any words of wisdom. ,Bipolar
46234,The mood tracker Dalio is getting a lot of love over at rdataisbeautiful. Link to post included in the comments below. The mood tracker Dalio is getting a lot of love over at rdataisbeautiful. I've linked to one of the positive reviews but the entire thread is worth skimming. The data presented is also interesting.As an aside I agree with Liz Millar a doctor who suffered from bipolar disorder and wrote a book on mood tracking that an additional axis giving energy levels would be useful.Feel free to comment. What is your favorite mood tracker? What features do you look for and how could they be improved? ,Bipolar
45906,Mania and hypersexuality I've engaged with a guy I pretty much know nothing about yesternight. I have a boyfriend. It meant nothing to me the sex last night but I was into it. I tend to be overly charming when I'm manic and with my looks I can get guys easily to do it with. The guilt hasn't sunk in yet. I love my boyfriend so much and the activity yesternight felt the same as like having coffee to talk to someone casually. Any suggestions how to handle this? ,Bipolar
7924,Hey!Our relationship seemed to have been going really well but then out of the blue she ghosted me for almost a week then said she cannot be in a relationship and that she cannot feel anything. she is been suffering from depression throughout our entire relationship but I just could not help. She does not want to get medical help and I am worried about her and I just cannot bear the thought of losing her. I am still in mad love and we are actually on good terms. I want to be there for her and I want to help her fight her depression but it is very very painful. What should I do? My girlfriend is depressed and says she cannot feel anything anymore.,Depression
7843,I am a 15M. I smoke weed as a way to cope with my anxiety and depression that gets worse at night. I also use it as a way to fall asleep easier. My dad found my weed last night and told me he was dissappointed he said it is not a good way to deal with things. He said he cannot force me what to do or what not to do but he trusted me enough and handed it back to me. I do not know what to feel about that. Right now my dad is also having troubles with my mom and sadly my little sister got stuck in the crossfire. My dad is barely talking to anyone like he used to. He does this very often. When he gets angry he shuts himself off and does not talk to anyone. He probably has a mental illness of some sort he is a very complex person. My mom once told him to go see a psychiatrist but he refused to because that is just how he is. He does not have a good relationship with his own father which might be a because or something.I also recently got diagnosed with mild depression and anxiety and got prescribed with Lexapro. I have been taking them for a week now. My mother is the only person I can always talk to but I cannot tell her about the weed thing because I got caught before in school and she knew. I want to explain to my dad about everything but knowing that he is the person that he is a part of me also does not want to open up to him. he is a sensitive person something so slight can trigger him to the point of shutting himself off from his family. Smoking weed has always been that barrier between me appreciating life and jumping off a cliff. I do not know if I should continue smoking or not I feel so guilty if l smoke because I know my dad is probably stressed about this situation also. I am pretty well known in my city I know alot of people but that does not help either. I cannot trust anyone at all. I have only 2 real friends my best friend and his girlfriend. I am so young I do not know why I am feeling this way it is so overwhelming. I just want to sleep all day and never wake up. I want to kill myself but in a way that noone would be sad about. I know there is people that care about me. My mom does. My dad does. My friends do. But when you are suicidal nothing really even matter anymore. I feel like I cannot take this. it is so overwhelming. I just want someone to read this and help me understand myself better because I barely know myself anymore. I hope someone reads this to the very end,Depression
9015,I honestly just feel empty unaccomplished and tired of even thinking about others and things that have it better than i do. I do not want to hear appreciate what you have i do but i still just feel like nothing. Sometimes i want to break down and cry but i cannot even do that because i just feel nothing. I have lost so many people in my life that were important it hurts everyday and people close to me just cannot understand. There use to be people like that but now they are dead too i do not even feel like my own girl feels me why are you sad? Idek myself at this point. there is apart of me that thinks i might achieve great things that all this shit is not for nothing but most days it just feels like an endless race to even care. I have tried taking my life before i still sometimes want to now. I do not even know if I am posting this wanting advice or if I am posting this because i feel like i need to scream and i cannot and the only mfs that might understand this are people Ill probably never meet. I have been taught to keep it all in and just move forward but doing that just makes me feel like I am going in reverse crying and feeling make me feel like a bitch. Idek myself anymore honestly do not feel like i ever did. Just feel empty sometimes,Depression
8989,I feel done. I think I am done.Nothing seems exciting it feels like the world has lost color. I do not know why I am here. I have a job and according to my friends that would make me feel better.I am done I am done taking up space I am done feeling like I am too much. I do not want to be here anymore Done,Depression
9146,It had taken me four years to recover from the breakdown I had and until recently I would been doing so well in terms of mental health. But all of a sudden the depression has hit me like a ton of bricks. I have been looking for a job but it is like as soon as they hear the reason I left my last job was for mental health reasons they do not want anything to do with me even though I am definitely qualified and experienced for it.I have no relationship prospects at all. I have been avoiding it all because I cannot bear the thought of hurting someone else with my issues but the loneliness is too much to handle sometimes.I still live at home and have to deal with a fair amount of stress but I cannot move out because I have no job so I am stuck here for a lot longer than I would like.I love my friends and family so much and wish them nothing but the absolute best but it hurts to see everyone so happy with their lives and moving on to bigger and better things while I am stuck in reverse.And everyone around the world has lost so much due to Covid among other things so I feel guilty about complaining about my situation when it is a paradise compared to what others have been through. I am just sad. I feel like there is no light at the end of the tunnel and my life is slipping away from me. I would been doing so well until now,Depression
7705,I am too scared to tell my manager but he wants to see me for a support session. I cannot bring myself to go back there even when i quit I will have to return my work phone and such too. I am so anxious over it I want to run away or cease to exist. I really need help How do I tell my job I need to quit because of mental health?,Depression
7160,Long story short I could not manage life very well with work and 2 kids and financial pressures and both me and my wife being depressed at the same time and things have come to an end pretty much but now that she is being even less supportive than before due to not having to be anymore I am finding everything harder and harder as each day goes by and the stress is mounting up and the depression is getting worse and worse and I am failing at all the little things that I was doing right at one point in desperate need to talk cuddle confide in my wife but she is not available anymore I have friends but they are not able to give me what I need. Therapy is too long between sessions and I am just very sad now. Not asking for help as there is nothing anyone can do for me this is all on me to fix just venting some pressure do not know how to do life fucked up my marriage now more depressed than ever and spiralling not knowing where to start,Depression
7260,I do not want to be normal and face all the expectations for a normal person because I know I cannot fulfill them. Am I the only one? I do not want to recover,Depression
7887,why did i let him convince me i can trust him? i feel fucking stupid nothing more humiliating than trusting someone with your depression because they promise they will always stay with you and then they leave lol,Depression
8509,I really hate this world. Look at the news you will ONLY see suffering and pain. The only time I will get some drops of happiness is when I take drugs and I know very well that is not the way. 90 of people are pieces of shits. Sometimes I just hope that I when I sleep that I will not wake up. I always thought I am not depressed because I am not sad but I am actually not feeling anything at all I am dull. The years of of heavy drug abuse left me scarred and its hard to accept but its the truth. The society that we all live in is pure bullshit and I hate almost everyone I know to some degree. I am always wearing a mask when I am with my friends and they would never know I am feeling like this. Fuck the world and everyone. Just some venting,Depression
8278,To be quite honest I felt validated. I have been struggling since I was 10. I am 20 now. All this time I thought there was something wrong with me or that whatever I was going through was not real. I still do not quite know how to talk about it with my family without making them worried. I struggle with suicidal ideation a lot and that is one reason why I want to tell my family that I have been struggling with depression so that they are aware of the risks. However I do not want to seek too much attention for the fear of being taken lightly or as a liability. I do not want people to think that they are obligated to make me feel good or be there for me as a form of pity. I also feel that nobody actually cares enough so why even bother. I know that is probably not true but it is hard to convince yourself of otherwise especially when you are depressed and have a particularly bad case of low esteem. I have not had the courage to tell anyone in my real life yet but I want to get it off my chest. After 10 years of struggle I was finally diagnosed with clinical depression yesterday.,Depression
9081,I do not know if I have depression or not. What I do know is that feeling the absolute fucking worst about everything and everyone around me happens quite often and never truly goes away. This knowledge that my mind goes to this place so often always stays at the back of my mind and I am always acutely aware of it regardless of whatever else I am doing. I can see it in my own eyes every time I look in the mirror. Sometimes I wonder whether other people see it too although I would guess not. Because no one checks up on me and the one person that claims to care about me is pretty shitty and inconsistent although she is the best I have got. I lost all my friends over a year ago and I know they all still talk about me from time to time which I am not sure if I appreciate or not. In this past year I have met a handful of people but still feel lonely and could not identify anyone who I would actually call a close friend nor do I delong to any kind of group of friends. In other words I am lonely. Sometimes I miss my old friends so bad and other times I am glad I do not speak to them for who they have become since then. I think this is around where my problems start but I do not know that for certain either. I am currently living in the worst stage of my life so far and I do not know if I will make it out. I am 19 and only a few years ago I had a clear view of what I wanted my life to turn out like and where it was going to go. It almost feels like all those things are happening and that I am being left behind to build my own new path brick by brick and I am all out if bricks. My head feels like a dull dense boring grey rock with nothing going in or out and nothing ever changing. I do not have access to weapons in my country but if I had a gun in my home I would point it under my chin without hesitation and seriously consider stopping this mess right there and then. I just feel like my head is a big grey rock with no individuality or sensitivity,Depression
8551,have not talked to a women in 3 years.. it is not like I have not tried too but there is literally no point when no one wants to give you a chance You just cannot fix lonely,Depression
7220,I feel really depressed. My dad is a toxic bitch and he pushed me and we were fighting and my sister was in the middle. I hate working too and on my day off shit is terrible. I hate living here in toxicity and I do not enjoy working. I do not enjoy anytging. My dads a horrible person and I am forced to be here Physical altercation with my dad.,Depression
8439,Even to people who have it matireally worse I do not think. Obviously like staring people etc. But this brain and this environment and these factors. it is like Tony from the office if he was also mildly schizophrenic. I really just exist in a state of limbo going through the motions. I honestly could not recommend my life,Depression
8582,I do not want to tell about this to my family or friends because of the negative thoughts that I have sometimes I am not much of a talker anyways. Depressed again,Depression
7137,I just want to give them a gun and tell them to shoot me until I am dead. I do not have the balls to do it myself and its the least I can do to atone for what I did. I want the people I have wronged to kill me,Depression
7452,I graduated college. Now suddenly my friends ignore me and the only one that hangs out with me is toxic as hell and treats me like shit. Like I am sorry I am bad at apex leave me alone. Now my gf is going to grad school in Kansas while I lay on my fucking bed. My family must feel like poking me with a stick. Like come on do something. But I cannot. I even tried moving out but the landlord texting me thought I was someone else and revoked the lease. No one want to hire me for a job I do not know what to do anymore and I have run out of my meds. Sorry for the rant but I am so sad. I miss my friends so much and I just wish I knew what I did wrong for them to cast me aside. I want to go back to school and study what I love and get good grades and feel pride. But its all gone. I did not do anything. But I have lost my life I feel like I have lost everything,Depression
8422,My doctor is switching me from cipralex to welbutrin and I am just wondering if anyone has any experience with these two. Copralex is good it is served me best out of everything else I have been on but it also has not gotten me out of my usual mood of pure apathy or anxiety. I have almost 0 interest in doing anything. I am scared of switching medications just because I do not know how I will react to it. I have pretty bad anxiety and the side effects mention that it might make anxiety worse. I do not want it to make me feel worse or affect my sex drive which is already lower because of antidepressants. it is just an all around shit show. Any information or words or encouragement would be very appreciated. I am so sick of this. Help please? Doctor is switching my medication,Depression
8478,I am 24M living in Parents' house. My dad has dreams about business and he thinks I am the guy who is going to complete those dreams. I never did a job anywhere. So I have poor work ethic. I do not know how to spend like literally I live on things I only need becuase that is how I brought up. On the other hand my brother dad and mom spend lot of money on things which I would not have bought because I am conditioned in that way. Even if I want something important but expensive thing I would convince myself that it is not needed and would go for cheaper alternative.To conclude I do not have good work ethic I feel guilty everytime I 'overspend' I am 24 yo useless guy Not to mention ugly I do not think I can do business and there are lot of expectations from family and Girlfriend. I do not even know if I am depressed because since last 9 years all I have done is live in a bubble and that bubble is now bursting. Will feel lucky if I died in sleep,Depression
8313,I hate myself so much and I feel so guilty and I know I am just hurting them. I have told my gf this and idk what is happening. So my gf went on a trip and I was ok I did not talk to anyone or nothing and this is the first time any of this has happened someone help. So this girl texts me and originally I wanted to be friends but the last message I sent to her I asked for stuff and I felt so guilt right after that I blocked her. I told my gf and I know that I am just hurting them at this point I am only eating once a day and stopped being my self please someone give some advice or feedback or something. I am probably the worst bf in the world,Depression
7907,Everyday i get more and more lonelier. I have people around yes yes but not someone who is my person if that makes sense. Is it so hard to ask for someone that will be your support comfort best friend. Someone who keeps me going helps me get out of depressive episodes. I just feel like I am going to go crazy and if i see one more person happy with their person I am going to cry. AHHHHH,Depression

8340,Male in my mid going on later 30s. As context i spent my 20s dating and then pining after the one that got away who was my only girlfriend thus far. Then i let myself go and got really obese and just did not think about relationships for a while. I have tried improving myself I make a six figure income i travel the world i dropped the weight so I am no longer obese. Paid for microneedling to remove acne scars.. and nothing despite trying every dating app. I even went on sites like SA to see if i could pay for companionship and still nothing. I share my picture and get ghosted. Its quite the hit to ones psyche. And I have been putting myself out there for over a year at this point. I have definitely had thoughts of just giving up and resigning myself to being alone for the rest of my life but that has cascaded into some fairly dark what is the point of it all notions in my head that id rather not contemplate again. So i get myself up and try again each day knowing its probably going to go on like the last I am sure this is fairly common to some extent but I have been getting reallg low more frequently because i think I am goibg to die alone with no kids,Depression
7044,tw talk about eating disorder further downHi sorry for long post and bad formatting. I do not know who to ask this as I am on a long waiting list for a psychologist and have no one else to talk to.I have always had problems with breakfast mostly because I have trouble waking up and am so tired that the thought of food makes me nauseous. Before work I am currently on sick leave I used to force down a sandwich only because I know I faint easily. Work also helped me maintain a somewhat proper meal schedule as I had designated lunch and snack breaks and I always had an appetite right after work.Now when I have been been home several months eating is a massive problem. Getting up earlier than 2pm is a huge but rare success but even if I do I just do not feel like eating for hours despite feeling so hungry my stomach hurts and my head spins. I just do not crave anything and I try to drown the hunger with water and cigarettes and occasionally save myself from fainting by eating dextrose.This results in me lying around like a zombie for hours not having the energy to do anything until I feel too weak to make even a sandwich without having to sit down. Basically during daytime I HATE eating. I wish humans did not HAVE to eat and could survive off water.But then in the evening I often find the cravings wash over me. Not only do I tend to eat unhealthy to begin with bc I do not have the energy to cook for example I often just have microwave food or frozen pizza but at night while watching shows or playing games I feel some kind of NEED to have something. Sometimes cigarettes and tea works but often the cravings are too strong. It can be anything I have lying around like crisps chocolate nuts anything. Sometimes it feels like a proper craving but sometimes it feels like I just have to occupy my hands and mouth. Not giving into this often results in nail biting instead or even worse pulling at my toenails until they bleed gross i know but I physically cannot stop and have not been able to show my feet to anyone throughout my life. Giving into the cravings on the other hand makes me feel disgusting like a grotesque emotional meat machine that keeps eating just for the sake of eating. I feel disgusted by the warm feeling I got after eating those tasty donuts like how I sometimes feel disgusted after spending money on some useless expensive shit I do not really need but that gave me happiness for one small moment. It makes me feel materialistic but like with food if that makes any sense.Now I know the lack of food during the day probably is a big reason for the nocturnal cravings. But it is so hard forcing myself to eat when my appetite is not there let alone cook proper meals. I am also very conscious about my body and feel like shit knowing that I have put on some weight in recent years even though I KNOW deep inside that no one cares about that and that weight should not define my attractiveness. But despite this I have never had an ED. And despite having somewhat EDlike thoughts about food this feels like mainly a problem with appetite related to my depression and apathetic tendencies. I know that if I could just pull myself together I could have somewhat healthy eating habits.My past therapist kept nagging me about meal planning but even when I am grocery shopping I cannot for the love of god come up with any ingredients to buy despite being kind of good at cooking. Hell planning ANYTHING nowadays feels like climbing a mountain.Does anyone have similar problems like lack of appetite? How do you refrain from giving into cravingscomfort eating? How do you manage your daily food intake when depression takes away most energy and enthusiasm to do anything at all? How do you deal with apathy the kind that makes it hard to even walk from the couch to the bed? How do you keep afloat? Because I am on the verge of drowning. No appetite during day cravings at night,Depression
8925,It makes me laugh in a halfshockedhalfdepressed kind of way that the common discourse around depression is still that it is an individual problem.For when the way that we live is so drastically different from how we evolved it is not hard to see why our minds may create some friction. We live disconnected from anything meaningful work relationships nature but above all meaning itself. Anyone who refuses to accept that the meaning of life is to work for money and possessions is sick in the head disturbed mentally ill.Your body uses pain to tell you that your current situation is dangerously off. Then is depression not your mind telling you that something needs to change? And if so how sick is it to try to change the mind itself to try to convince it that no pain is actually fine there is nothing wrong. Our minds are trying to tell us that we are not meant to live this way that there IS something greater to experience in life than sleepwalking through every dull day collecting our checks so that we can pretend to have fun for a few hours each weekend. Our minds are trying to get us outside into nature to find friends and do real meaningful activities with them to get away from all the stress anger and jealousy of the cities and return to how we were meant to live. A simple life with meaningful work meaningful goals meaningful friendships but above all a way to find meaning in every action to feel like there is a reason to live.There is something better. We do not have to live like this. We are not meant to live like this,Depression
8840,anyone else feel like they are just waiting to meet someone so you can have a person again to do fun things with all the time text your every thought to and just be happy with? also i know people will say happiness comes from within and not a relationship but idk that is just how i feel lately being single has made me very depressed,Depression
7587,I am sorry I am unlovable I am sorry I am not good enough I am sorry I am not a good person I am sorry I am selfish I am sorry I am pathetic I am sorry for being a waste I am sorry for being useless I am sorry for never being enough I am sorry I cannot do anything right I am sorry for always screwing up I am sorry for being a disappointment I am sorry for being annoying I am sorry for being worthlessI'm sorry I do not know how much longer I can do this. I am sorry,Depression

8745,why cannot i just. do things right lmfao I am so unhappy,Depression
8024,did not really know where to post this but needed somewhere to vent. In the past weeks I have had a lot of unfortunate events unfold anxiety building feelings of numbness to emotion. To pile onto everything a good highschool friend of mine had passed away I have cried several nights and spent days completely emotionless friends and family trying to comfort me are met with dull response and low energy and I hate how I feel right now I am fully aware this is probably normal but it is really taking its toll on me. Not really sure where I am going with this post but if anyone has had something similar happen to them I would love to hear some comforting words and some strategies I can implement to put myself back onto the road of self improvement. This is not something I like talking about with friends or family as I am not really in a state to do so right now. My friend recently passed from cancer feeling numb,Depression
9147,I am only 21M but I always have this feeling like my life has passed me by. Its like people who are getting older and then realize they wasted their life or that they never fulfilled their dreams. Right now I am going to art school. I really want to be a writer. Lately I have been pretty lacking in motivation blah blah depression.So part of the reason I am depressed is because I have contemplated transferring for a long time. I am not sure why I am obsessed with going to another school but I feel like I am not good enough to stay or be a writer. But I also do not want everything to pass me by. Overall I am just feeling lost. What is this? I am sure I am not alone in feeling this way. But I do not know how to cope with the days of deep depression feeling like people want nothing to do with me or thinking about running away. I always feel so old.,Depression
8640,it is not like I have a terrible life or anything but I do not get it. I go on stunning hikes and feel little more than meh. I do things I think I like but stop because I feel no gratification. Shit even when I help my friends and family I feel nothing despite their genuine appreciation. I do not get what is so great about existing.,Depression
8549,I resigned from my job 2 months ago because my depression and anxiety was really bad. Two months has passed and I am doing nothing but watching shows to kill time. The moment I think of furthering my studies anxiety kicks in and all related thoughts are halted. My physical appearance has no redeeming features except for my eyes and the weight gain has really become insane. I am the heaviest I have ever been in my life and I have been trying to cut my food intake. I am still gaining weight despite it. I have searched up on cosmetic surgeries but I do not even have enough money to go through with it. it is far too expensive.When I was 10 I am sure this was not how I thought my future would be like. It sucks how it is and I cannot get myself out of this. Death seems like the only way out for me. it is really pathetic how I cannot seem to do anything about it. Broken with no hope in sight,Depression
8714,Throwaway because yeah.So I moved in with my partner around 7 months ago. He has both a cat and a dog who are lovely animals and I generally do not have any issues with them. But recently his dog has started pooping and being sick in the house on an almost daily basis normally overnight. it is not health related or anything but just because she is an older dog. She gets her walks and let out for frequent toilet breaks. Now I am the one who gets up first every morning so I have to deal with the mess and I will be honest it is really fucking with my head.I do not wake up great to begin with due to my fucking awful mental health but this can send me into this feeling of white hot rage. I generally keep the anger to myself and smoke a cigarette but sometimes it can lead to an argument. it is making me not want to leave my bed in the morning and I have worked really hard to be able to do that on the best of days. I do not really know how to deal with this and it probably just sounds really petty and stupid but I needed to vent so thanks for reading regardless. Mental health and pets.,Depression
8504,Been in the fog for a few days. Things just seem to add up and overwhelm. Anyways just grabbed my son and went for a 10 mile bike ride at lunch. Came home showered ate a light lunch and back to work feeling pretty good for the first time in a few days. Tiny victory,Depression
7800,My bf and I have been together for several months now. He told me about his depression pretty early on but he had been doing well overall for quite a while. Well over the last few weeks he has started having symptoms and has been struggling. I am trying my best to be there for him without trying to fix him. But it is difficult. My question is who is it OK to talk to? Everyone in me life has either met him or will likely meet him at some point so I do not want to talk to someone when he would not want them to know. So where do I turn for support? I know therapy would be ideal but I do not really have money for that right now. Would appreciate advice. Who do I talk to? Partner going through depressive episode.,Depression
8800,At least then I would have a reason to cut people off. At least then I could have.a good reason to not speak to my family again. At least I could say they were mean and cruel and I could leave. But no they just... do not care. they have never cared about what I am interested in. Never took the time to get interested with me. Only ever bought me the presents I had to write out on a list. No surprise parties. No trips that considered what might be entertaining for a only child. I was never considered in any of it. I did not get to help pick out a dog. My friends do not care. Friend. They prefer watching streamers over talking with me. If that streamer actually streamed more I would never see them. That feels so fucking degrading. So and so cancelled stream so you want to chat No I do not. I am tired of being second choice. But god if I do not say yes then I am literally alone. So I cling on to that last string even if one day I will be hanged by it. I think I would feel better if I was hated,Depression
8332,I have been seeing a therapist for almost a year now. i do not think its gotten better. do not have many friends and i cannot talk to others about this for more than 10 minutes. what am i going to do? what options do i have?,Depression
7768,Ok maybe I do not HATE my life but I think I am unhappy. I am 31f married 1 kid 1 step kid. My family life is fine for the most part. My toddler is a handful though which I was not prepared for. I wanted to become a mom so bad. Now I fantasize about life when I lived in a different city alone for 4 years as a single woman. I had friends and a job I did not hate I do not think and I wish I could go back to being free. My career life sucks. Please do not judge me. I am a nightshift NICU RN for almost 4 years and I hate going to work. I believe I am very introverted. I am not a people person hell even my husband talks too much for me sometimes. I dislike going to work I dislike the babies I dislike the parents. there is no passion there at all. I just never want to be there. However I am not sure if I even remember what its like to feel anything other than what I constantly feel which is nothing. I am worried that this is baseline for me. I would feel so much better if I was actually going through depression or something because then I know that my life can feel better. I am currently in the job market looking to explore different nursing jobs away from bedside that I might enjoy. I am looking into working for an insurance company to do utilization review. I have an interview today and I am nervous because if I do not get this job I have nothing else lined up and I definitely will become depressed if I am not already. We recently bought a house that I am waiting to close on in about a month our current living situation also contributes to my poor feelings about my life. At this moment I just feel very unhappy. Everyday is a struggle. I just need good energy. Thank you. I hate my life,Depression
7828,I have an appointment tomorrow but I am not sure if its a stupid idea to go. I feel so empty and numb I cannot feel emotions and feel like I have just shut down. I have tried to cry but its like I am not even capable to cry anymore. I do not know what to say when the psychiatrist asked me why are you here.. I have been thinking so hard on how to answer that question because I do not even know what is truly bothering me. People have it so much worse than I do yet here I am Should I even see a psychiatrist ??,Depression
6963,I do not know how to navigate these feelings not that its a new feeling by any stretch. I just do not understand how I can go on from being so pleasantly fine to suicidal and self loathing within in minutes and not be able to step out of it. I have been suffering from poor mental health for over 10 years and I am about to turn 26 next week and I feel so ashamed for how serious my negative thoughts are. Covid was a hard transition especially having moved to a new city a few months before everything started locking down but now I am here and settled and I have a loving partner a great connection to their family a really fun job and I finished my degree. But when I stop and look around I feel like nothing will ever be good enough for me and I will never be good enough I will always have skin problems and bad teeth and acne. I will never be the artist I used to be I have a Bachelor in fine art because I do not have the same drive or passionate that I used to have for it. I will never have the career I built my entire plan around because I am losing my interest in art. I will never have the relationship with my family that I want because I could not stand to stay in my hometown. All I can feel is this tornado of my failures swirling around me all the damn time. It just seems that no matter how many positives come my way they do not last long enough to out weight the negatives. I do not really know what I am looking for I guess I just wanted to say this out loud or whatever. 0 to 100,Depression
7999,Hi all hope you are doing well. I Recently had a conversation with my significant other and it came out that she is been dealing with worse depression and anxiety lately.We talked about tackling it together. We talked about doing exercise together and eating well together. I have a question or two for you. 1. What things generally relieve the feelings of depression? 2. What gestureaction from someone else would make you feel better? Significant other is dealing with depression. What can I do?,Depression
8083,I feel like an empty pit of nothing but sadness and despair and loneliness. This is not supposed to be what my high school years are like. I am basically set up to be the happiest girl ever but I cannot. I do not even deserve to be here. Why cannot I just be happy,Depression
8584,I feel like killing myself. just had one of the worst days of my life,Depression
7238,I have been having an extreme depressive episode and did not wash my hair for two weeks and I am finally going to get to that right now is anyone proud of me? ltits so hard for me to do anything right now. i feel extremely hopeless and helpless everything I am doing is just so hecking difficult and i just really want someone to tell me I am doing a good job because my dad just got mad at me for it saying i should have soonerim also planning on taking a shower tomorrow is anyone proud of me? ,Depression
8451,Today after 15 year that I spent doin nothing because of my severe depression I have tried goin to the employment centerI had a meeting for being legally allowed to work and before the meeting I have cried a lot outside in the parking area because of the stress and the anxiety I was feeling. When I went back home I was EXHAUSTED. I have done NOTHING all day just layed in bed and thought about how miserable I am. I have an headache now. I want to kill myself so bad I am so sad and depressed,Depression
7206,I spent 2 hours writing a post on here until my phone glitched and deleted it all. Then I realized I was over sharing amp decided not to type it all out again. It was good therapy venting to myself anyways.7 months ago my newborn son passed away 2 days before his 1 month birthday. He stopped breathing in his sleep spent 9 hours at ER amp then passed away in my husband amp Is arms. I thought I was doing better but these past few weeks have been miserable. I was told prior to conceiving him and after 4 miscarriages that I had pcos and probably would never be able to conceive or have a pregnancy success. I found out two days before Mothers Day 2020 that I was having him amp I named him after Gabriel the messenger of God. He was the most amazing thing to ever happen to me and the most beautiful thing I had ever seen in my life. I wish every day I was the one who died instead of him.I am only 20 years old yet I feel as if I have been through so much. I feel like God is punishing me in my life and I can never be happy. I do not understand why he had to cut short the life of a beautiful baby. I cannot eat I am always tired I am always reliving the moment my husband runs into our room screaming hes not breathing.Every night I fall asleep to images of what I think he would look like now. I am trying to conceive again to no avail. I want to be a mother so badly but no other baby will be like him and my body will not cooperate regardless. I do not want to kill myself but I feel like I have nothing to live for anyways.He saved my from a severe eating disorder amp addiction. He made me grow up and turned me into a woman. I moved out I got my shit together my husband and I got married so my baby could have a happy home.I will never get to see him take his first steps say momma for the first time get to give him his first taste of sugar. I was so excited to take him to the beach I bought a swimsuit that was several sizes too big so he could wear it in the summer. Its in his closet with the tags still.I sleep with his onesies in our king size bed. I wish it was him instead . I do not know why I am posting this I have had Reddit for a long time and have never made a real post. Maybe I am looking for people to relate to or maybe this is a cry for help. I do not want to die but I want something to live for and I want a sign that my baby is okay amp watching over me. I wish I knew for sure. I think this whole experience has made me more religious because I know he was too pure and perfect to go anywhere else other than heaven and I hope one day I will finally be okay amp get to see my boy again. If anyone knows how I can move on or find some peace I would love to hear it. Thank you for reading this amp best of luck on your journey to happiness. I have not found mine yet but hopefully I will feel that joy he gave me again. TW I cannot get over the death of my baby.,Depression
9145,My father committed suicide maybe is genetic It was great for a while but some people are so lucky i hate the unfairness of life. and I hate almost everybody. it is no fun anymore life used to be exciting and fun. Now is a chore.I hate being so whinny but I am tired and sick. I shoulda been a porn be actor like Ed Powers he seems to have fun and not having to work.I am so bored. Only sex is in Worthy. Good sex. I do not want to be alive anymore,Depression
8773,I am fucked up as shit getting fat agonizing break bad and hopeless. Living alone with a pension a 26 and have nobody next to me no job and fucking mania killing myself every night. I really wish everything to be done soon. I do not deserve this pain. Whoever suffer of bipolar depression i do not know how you carry on,Depression
7857,I am no longer in love with my partner. He still loves me and wants to make it work but I do not see a future with us. I think it is a matter of when not if. I still kind of want to make it work though we have a child together. Our daughter does not live with us because of our jobs and the hours we work but she lives with his mother and stepfather. I feel like if I leave him I will not get to see my daughter much and ruin that relationship. We have been trying to make it work for 2 years now daughter is 2yo but we just keep going in circles. it is not good it is not bad just fine. I want more than that.I also cannot financially move out so I just feel stuck and hopeless. I do not know if it is worth just keeping on going and pretending everything's fine for the sake of our daughter or taking a risk and leaving in the hopes I will be happier. I am stuck,Depression
7810,Please....I do not want to hate myself anymore. I cannot handle the negative emotions 247 7 days a week anymore. I do not want to feel useless and worthless. I want to be okay for once in my life. My brain keeps beating me up telling me I am trash. I am stressed out I can barely sleep. I am all alone. I want to be set free from this but I cannot I am in so much pain,Depression
8954,How do I figure out if I deserve help. I mean mostly deserve a therapist's time to work with a patient. Do I deserve their time regardless of the money I pay them? I just have too many questions for them.Also does it sound illogical when I say that I do not want to take deep breaths and calm myselfbecause that means ignoring the anxiety and treating it like something that is overreacting that needs to be fixed. Treating the anxiety as wrongnot okay. I thought you should treat the anxiety as a friend and live with it. Not shush it from the conscience. Thanks. Do I deserve help,Depression
8415,Realizing you are depressed takes a lot of time and affects you badly the more you delay not accepting it or hating yourself for being Depressed. Now coming to the title. The time flies by and before you realize you have passed a lot of months with nothing happening but just the constant worry and suffering. Its extremely hard to get a grasp on time and look out for short term goals or positivity. Anyone feels the same ? Its tough to get a hold and grasp on the concept of TIME itself.,Depression
7772,Last year I got into music production and i quote it as the happiest year of my life.I was working on music 6 hours a day at least. I once managed to pull off working for 12 hours.I really loved what I was doing but this year..its different I do not know how.I am just lost I can barely work for 2 hours and worst thing is games are back into my life. In 2020 everything that could possibly happen that is good to me has happend. I lost all my weight and got on some serious muscles all by working from home. I had such a mentality for work that year it was ahead of everything.Back then I loved music so much I managed to not play games at all I once did not boot up anything for 2 weeks straight. Now I play games almost everyday for 2 hours or so and the worst thing is this fucking game Hearts of Iron 4 got me hooked onto it but it did not made me political. I just remember the days when I was a fat piece of shit and was playing that game in 2016 and I get anxious about all of that coming back right at me.I even uninstalled the game few days ago in hopes of my work hours going up but it did no such thing.What I am trying to say is that I lost the working spirit and I do not know how I am genuinely not a lazy person.There is a person in my life that is stressing me a lot I think about it everyday and it does bother me.I do not want to talk about it but I do want to meantion it I was mad at the same person last year but I was still managing to work very hard.I am not suicidal nor do I think about it just trapped in an endless loop of anger towards myself.Feel like I am in a minefield that I have to look at every single step I take.There is something to meantion though I have quit drinking coffee and any unhealthy drinks energy drinks coca cola pepsi and alike for 6 months now.Those drinks gave me the ability to stay up at night and make music which was perfect because every producer encourages that its just like magic when you work on music while your brain is half dead.But now I cannot make it past 10 what is interesting is that I can play games untill 1 in the morning but not make music and that is 1 of the many reasons I hate myself. What is wrong with me,Depression
7354,I have been going on a streak for like 4 days in row of being sad but it either goes away really quick or stays for a while. I am usually really happy and not sad much but I feel like there might be a problem because I feel lazier and have not been going outside a lot like I used to. What should I do I think I might be depressed,Depression
6999,I cannot seem to go a couple of months without selfsabotaging myself. I do not know what comes first the depression or the selfsabotage but they work hand in hand to make me absolutely miserable. For the first time in two years I am considering going back to therapy because I just cannot live like this anymore. I cannot keep repeatedly just making things unreasonably hard for myself. I deserve happiness and a chance at success just as much as anyone else. I just have to figure out a way to actually believe that to put my words into thought and action. Selfsabotage,Depression
7593,I figured I would rant in a depression sub more than anywhere else. I always feel like I should not have any real reason to be depressed because I live in a first world country where there is an abudance of opportunity for anything you want. However I have feelings of selfdoubt pity anxiety and a general low selfesteem most of the time. I am 23 years old and I hate my life. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in August 2020 and I still have not found a job in my field. This is partially the reason why my depression is bad. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and the last girl I tried to talk to ended up ghosting me. I do not particulary blame them either as it is my fault at the end of the day. I cannot beat the depression no matter how hard I try. I have followed every piece of advice I can take such as exercising eating well sleeping 8 hours a day getting sunlight and I still feel like a piece of shit more and more. I would believe this might have to do with childhoodteenage trauma that I have had. My brother was not the best person in my life which sucks becasue up to when I was 13 years old he was amazing and awesome. Afterwards he would because me a lot of physical abuse and mental abuse. He gave me two black eyes in school which many teachers would question if I was okay at home. I was not but I did not let them know that to protect my brother from receiving a bad reputation. I told my parents but they did not really do anything about it besides a stern talking to my brother. He left me in 15 temperature one time for a few hours where I was just wandering the neighbourhood I live fairly far from any store so I did not really have a shelter. The thing that makes it worse is that he has a successful life with a loving wife and amazing friends. It makes me sad that people can harm others and still never receive any karma. The next factor is the amount of bullying I received as a kid from my former friends. Surprisingly the ones who became my bully was my friend. This friend is very charismatic and good at getting friends himself. Due to my shyness and having virtually no backbone I became a really easy target when we started highschool as he was able to convince other kids to bully me as well. The bullying was not anything crazy just namecalling and making me look dumb a lot. However they did this every day and it ended up taking a toll on me. These kids are also super successful now and have great relationships. I realized more in University how pathetic and below average I am to my peers. Everyone else can do things much more easier than I can have much more talents and are generally smarter than me. I have extreme social anxiety and I always struggle showing my persoanlity around others. Maybe it is a defense mechanism and I will be betrayed again. Some Good Will Hunting type of shit lol If it was not for TV shows and the internet I would be a lot more depressed than I am now. I honestly believe I am a burden to everyone around me and my parents are making it more clear that they do not want me around since I have not obtained a job in my field and am sorta just coasting in life right now. Thank you for reading this post if you have but if not I understand as well. TLDR I am killing myself in a month and I generally do not have any actualy reason to want to keep living Killing Myself Soon,Depression
8389,I do not know why I wake up in the morning. I find it hard coz I got nothing to look forward to.The melancholia drowns me when I realize how alone I am choking depression grips me.ampx200Bdo not have a dad mom's got her own battles. How the fuck could I have turned out normal?Sensory overload is too much sometimes so I numb myself with drugs and alcohol. What else was an empathetic overly sensitive kid supposed to turn to for support when the humans would give no love?ampx200BI suppose I should count the blessings I have had as well as few as they may be.My grandparents being there for me kept me going although its not like I did not try the easy way out when they were around.ampx200BNow I got no one nothing.Mom's still fighting her battles I try to help but I cannot save her from herself. Rest of the relatives cousins and uncles and aunts sometimes they were a blessing often they were not. Love life How can I love life when I have not had a love life since a long long time. But I guess that was my fault for loving someone 8000 miles away. Now I do not feel like trying it feels like a waste of time. Am I loveless? Or do I just love less? Since love left I have nothing left to feel Home by Passenger As for friends the good ones are gone the rest are busy with their own lives. Loyalty does not mean anything anymore everyone is ready to turn on a dime. I had hoped that the bridges I had to burn would light the way but the path seems to be getting darker the more I look at it.ampx200B I can write a million words and fill a hundred books with the thoughts that run through my mind but in no coherent order. But then I wonder who the fuck wants to listen to a loser's tale. I feel like a loser because in spite of the gift of brilliance that was bestowed upon me I have accomplished nothing of significance. It frustrates me to look in the mirror and see such a mighty being reduced to a pitiful product of the environment. A lot of people find solace in chasing money and I know its important because I have never had any. But more important is a purpose in life that is what gives it meaning.ampx200BI live another day to persevere and find my way.But if I do not find it the reset button is just a dive away. Cornucopia of Jumbled Thoughts Should I go on?,Depression
7306,I know I am just 20 years old but ever since these depressive episode started when I was 16 it is only getting worst. Yesterday I lived the worst day of this entire year when I found my cat dead in the kitchen. He was everything to me and he was just one year old. I am unemployed no one wants to hire me I do not have friends my mom does not accept my sexuality or anything I do because she is very religious I do not have dreams for my life I do not know what I want to do I am hopeless everyday I wonder why I am still alive My life is only getting worst,Depression
8141,All I want to do all I have ever wanted to do is stay home watch anime and play video games. Everything else is pain in the ass I am tired of life,Depression
9067,I am angry and sad I want to scream and cry. I want to hurt myself or break something. I just cannot fucking handle this.I hate the fact that I am STILL waiting on therapy. Originally I was waiting to hear about scheduling. Then I learned that no counselors could handle my scheduleI work till 7pm monFri. So my supervisor said make it work no matter what. I opened my schedule but I think I am not going to hear anything back from them.I just need some way to cope with all these emotions. I want to be able to cope and I used to think I could but now that I am getting hit from every direction I realize all I can do to handle it is break down and hurt myself. I promised I would not do it again and now I just do not know what to do.I tried watching some YouTube I tried smoking my vape. I would considering trying to play some games but I will probably punch my laptop. If I go for a walk I will end up punching a wall and will make my work life harder since I need hands. I even considered writing some poetry but all that is coming to my head is FUUUCK I want to do something I will regret. cannot even jerk off because I am porn free now and if I use my imagination I would probably rip my dick off. So now I am sitting here numb but feeling all of this at once. I am just scrolling reddit not even reading the posts. I can barely feel my arms. I am considering going out and getting a 6pack but I am afraid if I use it to cope once I will use it to cope over and over again and I will end up a sad lonely drunk and then I will actually try to kill myself.I have got nothing right now I cannot even talk to my friends about this because there is secretsnot mine they cannot know. Even if I talked to someone they would probably not understand and try to twist things around or argue what actually happened. I do not need that I just need to feel better. My head is just so fucking noisy,Depression
8770,I am useless to anybody I know nobody values me I do not care if I am dead,Depression
8514,I have told my boyfriend that I am going through a really rough patch and am feeling low and basically grumpy. Trouble is he keeps trying to cheer me up by being silly and playful which is sweet but I keep telling him today is not the day. That I am sorry but I am just not going to be much fun today. He keeps on till I get irritable and snappy then hes like 'whoa someone is a grumpy boy today' it is like 'yes I fucking told you I am going to be a grump. Can you just let me be low today. I do not want to try and play happy. I want to rest and I cannot fo that pretending I am all happy. I wish sometimes people would listen more to what we are saying and not do what they think will help. Stop trying to cheer us up sometimes it is just worse.,Depression
8233,Things like acne and a crooked nose may be brushed off by some people. However if they are causing you do lose sleep cry and hate yourself they are to you what some seemingly much more severe things are to others. You are not an ungrateful brat for this. it is okay to be depressed because you are balding or because you have never had a gfbf. Just because you have not been abused or had a horrible life does not mean your feelings are less valid. Different things hurt people in different ways.,Depression
9068,I do not get it. I do not get why i feel this way. I have a mom who loves me and who i love to death a dad that cares about me. A sibling who looks up to me. I am 15 I have been going to therapy since last year.She said i got better she said my aura had changed she said i seem happier and that was true for some time but now i do not even know. I do good in school i have 3 friends who love me. Who i told that i hate myself. I am a white middle class girl who lives in a safe town. But yet i find my self crying for no reason. I find myself feeling numb and on the verge of breakdowns when hanging out with friends. I am terrified of death yet I want him to take my hand sooner than he has planned. I lay in bed and stare at my room that my mom begs for me to clean so desperately. She begs me to come downstairs and hangout with her yet i cannot and i feel so guilty for not doing so. My dad cried once because he realized he was too hard on me. I do not eat as much as i used to a toddler could eat more than me in a day. The clothes on my back get changed when i take a shower which is a disgusting amount of days to some people. I read books wishing i was the main character i would not have to worry about getting a shitty job that i hate just so i can become another employee to this company we call the you.S. The Earth is dying and there is nothing i can do about it. I want to live life to the fullest before the end but i cannot find myself having the energy or the funds to do so. I do not see a point to life the only thing stopping me is my mom walking in on my dead body. I cannot see my life being worth it in the long run I cannot see the money my parents spend to feed and attempt to give me joy worth it. I do not get it i really do not get it i do not get why i have mascara stained cheeks right now. i do not get why two people decided to have sex one day. I do not get why I am drowning in my own misery while people have it worse. I remember in school we asked the question if a character in the book was weak or not for committing sucide. Every single person said weak. I do not see myself as a weak person and i do not think anyone who thinks about ending it is weak. I just think they want peace and they are tired. I am tired. Those few minutes of happiness a day are not worth the amount of dread i feel a week. I am young yet I am already exhausted,Depression
7381,I could get out of bed. I could go to work. I could muster up a laugh when my coworker cracked a joke. Why does my brain flip a coin each morning about whether it will be easy or not? Days like today make me think there is hope but I am scared of tomorrow. Today was easy.,Depression
7577,Lately I have been so lonely that its starting to really mess with me. I cannot pay attention at work and I am slowly losing all interest in the things I enjoy doing. Even though I live with 5 other roommates I still feel alone all the time and it sucks. Does anyone else feel this way? Sorry for any grammar mistakes Lonely.,Depression
8578,Hi everyone this is my first post here and I am just feeling so tired and unmotivated. I do not even feel like going to my therapist anymore. I feel pathetic saying its too much effort because its literally over zoom but its just too much. I do not feel like talking about my problems anymore. I just feel like forgetting about them. she is a lovely therapist but I just do not want to deal with this anymore. I just feel so sad lately its almost becoming to the point of numbness. Luckily I do not live with my parents anymore so they do not physically notice. I barely shower anymore unless I have to. I hate brushing my teeth my room and bathroom are disgusting I cannot even find the motivation to make myself food anymore. I am in so much debt right now and my boss was talking to me about getting a promotion at work and then she just went over and handed it to someone else. I just want to disappear. Not even necessarily wanting to die but I just want to be gone and not have to deal with my life anymore. Just so tired,Depression
7157,Maybe I am just a sociopath. what is wrong with me? My grandmother died and everyone seemed so shocked at her funer. I was simply standing there dead inside as always. I do not know maybe I am not capable of guilt. Everyone was crying except me. Am I a monster?,Depression
8255,What would it be? I think mine would be suffocating If you could describe your depression in a word or two..,Depression
8029,Hi just posting this because I am in a mood for sharing my experience. I am 26 with MDD and recovering from stroke. Prior writing this post I just had a depressive episode where I cried for almost an hour to calm me down I just took a shower and still did skincarebecause I still want to take care of my skin even if I look ugly. skincareislife.Recently I found myself liking to post seducing photos of me online and makes me feel validated I guess. Upon writing this post I started a mock research paper about how posting seducing photos or my sexual behavior will affect my selfesteem. I am now in a manic episode rn because I have so much things to say I have already wrote a title an abstract for it and an introduction. I have 4 pages for it people. I am not taking it seriously but I am curious to see how far this reoccurring maniac inside will go to finish the selfresearch I am making as I venture myself out as a sexual attraction online. Well IDK if I am making sense right now. Or maybe I just need someone to talk to idk. But just follow this post maybe if you are interested for the progress when my mania side will come up and continue doing this mock research again or maybe finish it. LOLampx200BHave a nice day folks!ampx200BResearch title that I gave to my mock paper THE EFFECTS OF POSTING SEDUCING PHOTOS ON REDDIT TO SELFESTEEM AND SEXUAL BAHEVIOR OF A PERSON DIAGNOSED WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDERMDD AND PHYSICAL RESTRICTIONS DUE TO CEREBELLAR STROKE Making a research paper out of nowhere about my depression,Depression
7888,I F16 feel like an outcast and an unwanted one at that. All of my peers seem to be interested in different things but I cannot find anything in common with any of them because there is nothing interesting about me I am also socially awkward big time so that does not help. Its so difficult for me to find friends and form romantic relationships. Like I said there is nothing interesting about me I have got no skills a couple hobbies maybe but I am not good at them. In addition to that I am not that attractive. My meds have made it hard to manage my weight and my face is just 410 if I am being generous. It just feels unfair compared to all the attractive girls who attend my school. I know what people say that its good to be different. But what if being different feels lonely? there is more to this but its 515 in the morning and I am tired. I feel like an outcast.,Depression
7204,I went to my psych about a week or so ago for a med checkup and I had a list of all these things I wanted to talk about mental health is exponentially declining. However I went into autopilot mode when the nurse was asking screening questions like do you have thoughts of selfharm? and so I automatically said no because I am so used to denying it. I really did want to tell the truth but it was like a reflex to say no. Similarly I put in a facade for my psych and basically said life was pretty good and blah blah blah. I am not doing well at all and I want to talk to my psych to see if a med change would help but I am not sure how to bring myself to call the office and I am also quite nervous to admit that I feel awful. The next appointment I have is not until 6 months from now and I am not sure I can wait that long without deteriorating even more. I apologize if this sounds whinyI think I already know what I need to do but I am just nervous and was wondering anyones thoughts? Needing Encouragement??,Depression
8984,My brother was diagnosed with MDD w to psychotic features over a month ago. Despite having antipsychotic meds and a therapist he only seems to be getting worse. Its only me my mom and him. The pressure is literally crushing my mom. He refuses to be open with anyone other than his girlfriend who has her own shit to deal with. He gets angry when my mom tries to check on him when hes spiraling almost to the point where I am scared to talk to him. We wake up to him banging on his walls so loud that my room shakes. We ask him what is going on and he either ignores us or says hes fine. His therapists will not talk to us without his permission which is understandable. We cannot afford for him to see a psychiatrist regularly and not many take his insurance. I feel like all we can do is watch himself worse and idk what to do. How do I help my brother who is struggling with MDD?,Depression
9044,So a lot is going on. I am about to finish grad school and I should be happy but I am not. I am beyond depressed. I have so much going on right now. I have applied to 6 or 7 jobs and have not even gotten 1 interview. I have very little work experience in my field. My sister is about to move to college. My brother wants to move out and go to trade school. I do not know how to drive. do not know what is next for me. My family feels like its falling apart and I feel like I am drowning. I have never had a full time job or even a demanding job. I feel like a waste of human existence. I do not know what to do,Depression
8583,I am not trying to make some edgy post about how I want to do drugs and shit but I do not think its something you can say without coming across like that so whatever. But I do not know I just want to do heroin really badly right now. I guess I am just sick of feeling so shitty and I am sick of nothing working to make it better. All the medications I have been on have done sweet fuck all and I have been through dozens at this point. Therapy has not helped me at all and I just feel awful all the time. I feel like I do not belong in the world at all and yet I am forced to exist in it. So I keep cycling between two thoughts constantly that I want to kill myself or that I want to do heroin. I do not know why but I really REALLY want to try heroin,Depression
8837,So I have a teenage brother who does not act his age but he is not sped or anything. I am about to turn 20 and he still wants to sleep with me. I feel uncomfortable sleeping with him we both have our own beds and I am in my mom's room since I am babysitting and he wants to sleep with me. I told him you are not a little boy go sleep in your room. I was told my depression was quite high and I tend to overreact sometimes but I just cannot control how I feel. I started crying from being upset and he still would not budge. My grandma said why I am so against it and I told her He mocks my depression every single time. You think I will feel comfortable sleeping with someone who mocks my depression? that is when both my grandma and aunt said it is all in your head. Control your feelings. it is just a minor thing no need to overreactI KNOW I am OVERREACTING BUT ITS NOT SOMETHING I CAN CONTROL. THEM SAYING ITS ALL IN YOUR HEAD MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT they are DISMISSING MY DEPRESSION AS SOMETHING SMALL. I FEEL REALLY HURT. I KNOW I ACT CHILDISH BUT I JUST cannot CONTROL MY FEELINGS. IT TOOK A LOT OF COURAGE FOR ME TO COME OUT TO SAY I HAVE DEPRESSION but i regret I ever did. They do not take my depression well. I attempted an overdose but they do not change their behavior towards me. Why did I ever decide to trust them?? All I ever wanted from them was to say they love me and that they will support me and take my depression seriously. Why is it that I feel that my doctor cares more than my family?? I really needed to rant so thank you guys for reading it is all in your head,Depression
8856,I have dealt with depression my entire life but lately this depression has been debilitating.. all I want to do is sleep and when I am awake I cannot seem to function normally I have bene out of work for some time also and I keep getting interview for jobs I know I could do if it were not for my brain drowning in my depression.. plus my husband does not understand it at all and does not seem to want to put up with it or even attempt to help me anymore probably frustrated and tired of it I wish I could just wake up feel normal and snap out of it I have no idea what else to do.. I have tried multiple medications books I need to try counseling again just beyond lost and shattered there does not seem to be any hope left.. Deeper depression,Depression
8497,Why are we forced to do this and that in schoolWhy does it existWhy are we forced for what we do not want to doWho are these random people pressurising meAm I living my life or is someone else living my life I need advice from not going insane,Depression
9130,CAN you? did not sink so. You can ban me once cannot ban me twice doe,Depression
7488,I know it may sound like something stupid to say but I am really trying my best to hang on. I am in high school doing my best to have a good school career so I can get into college and run with the plan for my life. I want to be an author. I want to be a dancer. I want to be something big one day it is always been the first thing I say when someone asks and I have never been embarrassed by it. These are the things that I have been using to keep my head up. But I am starting to wonder if there is no real reason to even dream about it anymore. It seems like the world is going downhill we will all probably be dead in a few years anyway. I hate thinking that there is no point to fight for anything anymore but what am I really doing just staying up stuck with so many horrible thoughts every night? Nobody cares about our planet. People are dying. Communities seem to be tearing apart. there is no more positivity anywhere. It feels as if everyone has just given up and although I do not want to and it hurts my heart to throw away the idea of being someone big I am starting to wonder if maybe it is just better if I tried. I do not know what to believe. I do not know what to do. Is there any dream of living past the age of eighteen or should I give up on these dreams and just stop trying? What am I going to do? Is there any point of trying anymore? Is there a point?,Depression
8243,I have not genuinely smiled in a long time and nowadays its becoming more of a chore to fake one. I have lost all my appetite and feel like vomiting when I take a few bites even when I am starving. I feel no joy in life and no hope for the future. Colours have lost their vibrancy making everything in life darker. I know nothing changed but my outlooks become dark and I cannot change it back to how I used to see the world. I have a few friends who I hang with from time to time but feel no enjoyment with them at all. My real friends are all over the world and Ill probably never see them again in my life. I cannot talk to anyone about how I am feeling because those friends do not really care and my supposed family does not do much talking. Most days I try to ignore how I am feeling but lately I cannot anymore. I cannot even be bothered to fake being normal anymore. I wake up only to sleep and nothing more. I am finding it hard to put everything to words because this is a first for me. If you have come this far thank you for reading my rant and I hope your day was better than mine I do not know what to do anymore,Depression
7846,They are meant to cool one's mind but in my case they heighten the levels of Stress anger and anxiety. Video games gives me stress and anxiety.,Depression
8426,Hello everybody I really do not know what I am supposed to say because I am BALLS DEEP in the abyss of isolation and misery right now and my thought patterns are all the way fucked up but Ill try my best and hope to interact with fellow sufferers. I am 21 years old live in New Jersey born and raised diagnosed with bipolar disorder schizoafective disorder and PTSD prescribed 900mg OxcarbazepineTrileptal 1200 mg NeurontinGabapentin and 80mg ZiprasidoneGeodon daily and feel like my symptoms have only worsened since I started taking medications and stopped smoking weed50 days clean. I am never happy I am always miserable I am always fucking bored I lost all my social skills i have 5 friends my family does not even like being around me my coworkers all know I am fucking insane and keep a distance from me I work at a gas station because I feel too incompetent to do anything else lol cannot get lower than that I had a physique like a young Hollywood teen actor until I allowed my depression to destroy it now I am skinny fat I always feel like a useless piece of shit degenerate loser I have only been laid by three girls and all three of them just wanted to fuck me for my body I have suicidal ideation running through my brain all day long hell I even almost died last year from a suicidal overdose on a bottle of lamictal but thankfully I survived it and got locked in a nuthouse for my 5th time in a three year span when I am not at work I lay in bed on my phone all day long joy ride take walks stress eat or go to the gym and when I am there I deal with crippling social and performance anxiety and can barely lift for an hour. I am emotionless cold have repulsive thoughts existential dread have destroyed any opportunity I have ever had placed in front of me feel like an outcast etc etc etc. I tell my psychiatrist that I do not want to take my meds anymore he gets nasty with me and tells me that he will not wean me off of them and if I want to stop taking my meds I am on my own. I got discharged from my Intensive Outpatient Therapy Program for smoking weed and refusing Residential treatment. I am so fucking stuck and have no idea what the fuck I am still doing existing I want to fucking die but I do not want to kill myself because I am scared of the pain of dying and what it would do to my parents. I smoke a juul pod a day for the sole purpose of getting cancer and all I want to do right now is smoke weed and mask my pain. My life has felt like a curse and a nightmare from the start and I feel like I am incapable of turning it around being loved or giving love. I am not asking for anybody to come up with a solution to my problems I just want somebody anybody who feels the pain I do or worse to interact with me because I am fucking lonely and scared. Need to get a lot off my chest.,Depression
8379,Over the last year I attempted to switch jobs and was let go from my new position due to my ex gf making a false statement about me online. I moved away with my girlfriend cannot find work and cannot afford to pay my debt. I have sold everything I own to make ends meet. I have handed out 1000s of resumes and I have a lot of experience and certificates in trades and engineering but I think what my ex said about me previously is preventing me from screening. We recently relocated and my girlfriend found employment. My car mirror was vandalized and my insurer will not be covering the repair it seems so I cannot drive to work. I have dealt with depression anxiety and suicide before but never this bad. I had to pay a bailiff to not repossess a car I cannot even drive. I am selling things I love like my cameras and guitars. I have truly lost everything and now I am fearful of losing my partner. I love her so much and its so hard for me to even think about but I am not sure what to do. I have income assistance but even that and her job is not enough to cover costs.I never thought Id be this low. I am not sure what the universe is trying to tell me. I am clean and sober I do not smoke I treat every person I meet with respect and I am always there to help. I hate seeing my girlfriend cry and I am not sure what else I can do at this point. As a human and a young man I feel defeated. I cannot handle anymore staffing companies or interviews that lead nowhere pay next to nothing or have 250 applicants. It seems like I cannot get a break. My last option is to move home to my mothers but there is other factors that make that less than desirable for my partner. I really do not know what there is left to do. I went from having. A house cars everything... the last thing I am scared to lose is her. I love her so much. I think I am done for,Depression
8258,Sometimes I can understand that my depression is a chemical thing that its something Ill have forever and can manage through drugs and therapy. But other times I think its just how I am supposed to be. I am a loser nothing goes my way. I was born into a family of privilege but I have made less than nothing of myself. Every job I apply for I get rejected I try incredibly hard at school and get mediocre grades. I worked my ass off even having a psychotic break to finish graduate school and gained literally nothing but debt. I got a professional certification in data analytics and cannot get a single interview. I met a girl I adore and her best friend goes out of his way to turn everyone against me. No matter how hard I try it what I try to do I am going to fail. I am really thinking I should not be trying anymore what is the point when you are doomed to fail? I am a loser,Depression
7320,I am 25 years old and I have never had a girlfriend had sex ben on a date kissed held hands been touched by been asked out etc. I graduated college last May. At my on campus job I became friends with a girl who I eventually fell head over heels in love with.I have been in love with her since 2018. Was rejected and ghosted in 2020. She texted me last year to say hi I answered and she never answered me back. I cry constantly and have been grieving every day for 3 years.The pain from never being able to be with her has made me suicidal and I have already attempted but failed to hang myself a few times. Its something I have to cope with every day. Its a sickness that never goes away. Its a pain that is not just emotional but physical. Again I have been dealing with this every single day since fall of 2018.Something this is rooted in is my crush wrote poetry a lot and I bought a copy of a collection she published while we were still friends in 2019. In the collection tehre was a poem about her losing her virginity. Reading that absolutely destroyed me. It kept me awake for days. I could not stand the thought of someone else having sex with someone I loved so dearly and longed to care for so much. One day she confided in me that her recent ex had been physically abusing her. More pain. Id fantasize about having sex with her but it would not help. I just imagined what it would be like if she actually loved me back and was attracted to me.Its getting to the point where everything related to having sex and relationships in general is painful to me. I even am starting to experience sexual dysfunction I do not get aroused as easily amd I can no longer watch pornography because it upsets me to see people being intimate because it makes me jealous and depressed that the is something I have never experienced before. I hear people talk about their gfs and wives and I get extremely sad.I found out my 20 year old sister lost her virginity months ago and when I did I cried for days. I felt indescribably disgusting and pathetic. I am 25. I should have lost my virginity first. I should have a gf or wife by now. Everything related to sex and relationships makes me violently depressed. It ruins my day.I am so fucking sick of feeling like this. Every time I hear about sex i just think Yep another person experiencing what Ill never get to experience. Everything and anything related to sex makes me want to kill myself.,Depression
7567,I am so tired of never feeling good enough. tired,Depression
8680,Does anyone else find that waking up in the morning is the most depressing time of day? I wake up sometimes and I feel like the world is closing in on me.I am just looking to see if other people have this issue.I do not really consider myself depressed per se and I try to maintain a positive outlook but the mornings are really hard for me sometimes. mornings,Depression
9137,Told a very close friend of 4years that i had been depressed for a while now and spoke about my ongoing problems with self harm a few weeks ago. They then proceeded to call me stupid that idk what I am doing and that I am just being an idiot overreacting on things. They also said that i will have worse problems in the future so i should not be depressed or self harm now. Ik they were trying to comfort me and tough love me but it still felt like they did not really care as they have never talked to me since and when i have tried to mention something they then said it was a lot for them to deal with and did not want to deal with it. Again i understand this it is very difficult to say to someone that you self harm and expect them to know how to handle it but now i feel like a burden speaking my issues with them. Maybe i am selfish for expecting them to be there to talk to i do not know i just would have thought they would have at least checked up on me as i do with them and as how i am happy to help them and be there for a talk when they need one and because i have helped them. I know it sounds selfish but i expected more as everyone says to tell someone and talk about it Am i bad for expecting more support from a friend,Depression
8562,Every fucking time I have got an episode I try to excuse my actions in the most stupid of ways which only makes the episode wost and broadens the problem by me worrying to goddam much about it. I am not going to kill myself but I need a way out talking is not going to work because the only I can talk to about this just is weird to talk about maily because she is the one I excused myself to in the most stupid of eays by just saying sorry if I am to much. I just fucking cannot. I do not fucking know anymore,Depression
9076,I am a 21 yo stupid guy not happy about my look still living with my boring parents. I feel like I did not achieve anything great in my life except attending a good university and being part of an association but I am not brilliant in my studies neither in my relationships. I was a cool guy when I was like 15 but then I changed and I became more and more an introvert and I feel like my parents are the ones to blame although I love them but I have a thought that everyone in this world is the mirror of his parents.So mine are conservative especially my mom she yells a lot she is very stubborn she is the one who decides in everything and that makes me sick my father is the nicest person that I know but he is also so dumb and irresponsible he always says yes to my mom and I feel like he is not like the other fathers like dominant respected fathers he does not have to be tough but at least he got respected from his family and friends which btw he has none maybe few and tbh I feel sorry for him and I am afraid that one day I will become like him that is my biggest fear. I always needed my parents to advice me to support me when I was depressed but they never did and once I told my mom that I really need a therapist she refused to let me go and see one . And for the last years I really needed to see a therapist until now but she never allowed me to do such things she thinks that doctors are thiefs and they are not able to make someone feel better and by time you will be a better person but It just get worse and worse I know you are going to say that I am mean to my parents but that is how I feel about them. What do you think redditors should I go see a therapist? My parents are my big problem,Depression
8402,I do not have any girlfriends. I want friends with similar interests. No friends,Depression
8662,I would be preaching to the choir if I explained how much pain I feel or how bleak things are. Can anybody share some quick tips on why I should stay alive or how I can? I do not think life is worth it and my mind is just mangled How can I keep living?,Depression
7364,I cannot seem to stop myself from crying every single day especially at night. I want to go back to feeling empty I am so tired of this sadness. I just want it to stop for just an hour. I am tired of crying.,Depression
8675,I have terrible anxiety. My parents will not allow me therapy. I do not have money nor the means to afford therapy. And I feel that I have repressed anger and depression. I am always thinking or overthinking most of the time. What must I do to recover or release this anxiety. I am not allowed to leave my house. So something I can do indoors will help alot. Thank you I want to learn how to release anxiety.,Depression
7640,Hi everyone. Can I ask for help? Lately I cannot see a future with my life. I have been considering ending it. I am incredibly sad I do not have someone to share this. My parents does not say that they think of me as trash but I can feel their disappointment. I thank them for that. I recently found out if I want a kid that child will be a sickly child. I decided to never have my own family not because I want to but because it is the right thing to do. I am cutting off my ties with my friends and family so when I do leave this life soon it will be more acceptable. I decided. I should not have ask for help. I do not know what to feel.,Depression
8628,Life sucks.nothing to look forward to I am considering giving up,Depression
9072,My body is the part that I dislike the most about myself. It weighs me down. Why do I have to take up space? Its a constant reminder of how clumsy my existance is. I do not feel comfortable in my mind either. Sometimes I feel like I cannot translate my thoughts into words all that is coming out of my mouth is an echo of my thoughts. I feel imprisoned. I want to get out. I want to disconnect. I want to be free. Feeling like your body is a prison,Depression
7939,Hi! I am new here. I have had depression before but I recovered from it. I started to be happy enjoyed even the smallest things. Everything was great but I looks like I am getting back to it. Seeing others travelling doing some fun activities in summer while I am just reading books and staying home all the time makes me feel like a total shit. I just do not see a purpose of my life when it is so boring. Why should I even live if I do not do anything good in my life and do not make any memories. Getting back to my depression.,Depression
9006,Honestly not even sure what I want to say. Kind of just want to let people know about motherhood and clinical depression. Not postpartum depression. I have struggled with selfhate ever since I was kid. I believe that nobody could can or ever will love me including myself. There just really is not much to like. Not soon after it became depression and I have just lived my life like this. I am married and have 2 kids. Just want to quickly say that depression is different from being depressed. Being depressed as my doctor explained is usually from outward influences. Depression is pretty much a neurological disorder that can be caused through trauma and the like. But yeah it does not get better with time like everybody says I have been waiting for a while for that miraculous day to come. Really I have no idea what I want to say. I guess if you struggle with depression please get help before getting into a serious relationship or having children. You may think that those things will help you I did but they do not. Instead you are family becomes almost an excuse for you to push yourself over the limit. Anyway I recently reached out and told my doctor and have been put in touch with a psychiatrist. It was hard to tell somebody as the only person who sort of knows is my husband. And I am legit scared to see a psychiatrist and talk about it again but I am waging a war with myself. Get help or disappear before my 2 year old is able to remember anything about me. Personally the latter seems like the better option but then I think about what it would do to him in the future. Would he really think I loved him and did it for him or would he think that it was his fault and that he was the problem? So I am getting help instead. There is so much more I want to say about having depression and being a mother but it will literally be a book and nobody wants to read that so yeah. It sucks but get help. Where to start,Depression
8556,they always ending up ghosting me fuck friends I do not need them,Depression
8465,If I tell my parents that I am feeling sad they might just brush it off and say Oh I am sorry. But if I tell them that on a scale from 10 to 10 with 10 being suicidal and 10 being my happiest day ever I am at a 2 today they have a better context for how I am feeling. Just thought I would pass it along. I find it helpful to tell my support network how I am feeling on a scale from 10 to 10,Depression
7208,How awful and disgusting is it that I am mad about me vaccinated having caught covid from my mom unvaccinated and having worse symptoms to boot? I did everything right. I masked I kept my distance I got my shots all of it. She treated it like a game and now I am worse of than she is. This is like some cosmic level you were evil in a past life bullshit if I have ever seen it. I must be the worst son in the world right now. Not specifically depression related but...,Depression
7757,I am posting this all over Reddit! Today marks 7 years sober from alcohol! it is still a really big struggle for me. The majority of my dreams have to do with alcohol. I miss it everyday. But I remain sober for my mom who has always supported me no matter how difficult my mental illness journey has been. So today we celebrate. Wish me luck! lt3 7 years sober from alcohol today ,Depression
8457,I am 25F. I was diagnosed with depression at 12 and borderline personality disorder at 23. It comes and goes but when its bad its BAD. Things are not going amazing in my life at the moment but also not particularly bad either. But i feel like I am in a serious slump.I have tried therapy multiple times in the last 13 years multiple different therapists and approaches but it honestly has never done anything for me at all.I have been on SO many different medications throughout the years and finally am on one that helps more than the others but still not fully. Nobody in my family deals with any mood disorders so they are not very understanding when i do go through slumps so i feel like I am not taken seriously and no one truly understands how bad i feel.I also do not want to try therapy again for the simple fact that i cannot afford it. I make too much for Medicaid and even with good insurance i was paying almost 300 out of pocket twice a month just for therapy alone not including my general appointments for my medication.I really only have 3 people i can talk to. One being my boyfriend of 6 years who is supportive and as helpful as he can be but given the fact hes never struggled with it himself he does not really understand. The other is my best friend who is honestly not the greatest friend in general and i feel like i bother her when i talk to her. The last person is my sister but she picks and chooses when she wants to listenhelp.I hate burdening people with my issues and i feel that is all i do. But i also feel like I am going to lose my mind. do not really know what to do anymore,Depression

50627,So tired of everything I am so goddamn tired of everything. I am not looking forward to anything have no goals..just a lowpaid job that I don't really like. I guess I can be proud that I got one in the first place despite how horribly painful that was to get used to it and my thoughts about quitting it after first week. But honestly other than that I have no clue why I am doing all this. I mean everything..going to job eating trying to do something..living. I am so tired I barely drag my body to work or practically anywhere. About my job..I got more or less used to it but I still feel like my coworkers hate me. It's my avpd brain acting up again. Goddamn pesky little thing. They're nice to me but this irrational part of me wins every time Every day is a misery and I am so tired.. I always tell myself that I have to go forward and don't stop but by now I am not sure why or where I am going. Feels like I am just aimlessly wandering around in the darkness with no clue whatsoever,Personality-disorder
50555,Youre still single man? Whats a young good looking guy like you doing wrong? My brain is broken. Im incapable of creating and maintaining close relationships either out of some awkward selfconsciousness or fear. Thats pretty much all there is to it. The fact that I seem pretty normalsmartathletic on the outside only makes things worse. People have expectations for me socially and I obviously dont meet them. So whats their conclusion? Hes weird something must be off about that guy. How can he have all this stuff but be so strange.Theyll never understand I just want to experience life like they do lol. Im forever the empath that cant make a life with other people.,Personality-disorder

50650,Mentally Exhausted I have been very mentally exhausted.I dont mind working long hours at my job its just at my job theres a lot of people around since its a large store connected to a bunch of departments. A few months since I graduated high school Ive been working. But I cant seem to really talk to people. I have a tendency to avoid the groups sometimes I cant even open my mouth. Its even worse when I think about how much I suck and how awful I look. I feel like an inconvenience and a burden because plainly I am pretty stupid. Even though at the beginning of my job I was putting on a smile and a happy voice to convince myself it was okay I cant even get myself to smile or look people in the eyes unless I have to. I am so exhausted. I dont know whats wrong with me. I am depressed both mentally and physically tired. I really have no plans for my future.,Personality-disorder
51181,Do AVPD attract Needy people? So my brand is of AVPD is very not giving a F about others. I care about people but in a relationship context I do not care. I sometime tell new people that ask for instagram or contact I don't need anymore friends. I've learned to put a super cold front to avoid people. However there is a subset of people that go harder the more I push or ghost them away. I typically find that they are approvalpeople seeking and want to be liked by everyone. So often times a friendship with me is hard one with them doing 70percent of the effort. Do you guys find this as a pattern?,Personality-disorder
50718,Am I a piece of shit or what? I mean I've never been diagnosed cause I'm afraid of going to the psychiatrist and discovering I'm a real shit but this days I was doing a personality check from Twitter just for the joke and the result avpd came so close home I felt offended.I grew up always walking behind my group of friends. I could never do anything apart from others. In any social situation it has always been my role to be the child in the corner or the one following the parents.It doesn't help my father is a controlling sexist. I've never slept out my own house never dated someone openly afraid he would beat me up never visited my friends houses I don't even know if I can call them friends.I'm nerdy but not smart. I always got high grades in school but I never liked being complimented on it because I thought most of my grades came from the cheating sheets I made to remember the subjects before the exams.If I have to talk with someone for anything I have a script in my head I have to follow to ensure I'm not saying anything idiot.After graduating from school I fell for my relative's advice and did not leave my hometown preferring to go to college in the neighboring city and work with that relative. Well we had a fight and I had to quit uni cuz I was fired.I couldn't muster up the strength to deliver resumes in my city due to sheer shyness.Five years have passed since then. I'm almost 23 years old. I'm just a high school graduate. No professional course taken no money in hand living with my parents...I still don't want to hand out resumes I don't want to get in touch with people... I long for physical contact but I don't have the courage to get close to anyone...So to you guys who suffer from avpd how do you cope with this shit? How do you guys have strength to work?Sorry my thoughts were all over the place while I was writing so please forgive me if it sounds confusing.,Personality-disorder
50959,How to deal with parent yelling Ok I'm a 27f who suffers from a variety of mh stuff so I'm living with my dad and he has a temper but today I was microwaving something and it exploded with glass and a mess right away I started cleaning it up bc it's my fault and he comes yelling that I messed up his microwave and how old I was and a bunch of swears and says he's not dealing with it and as always I internalize it and after I was done cleaning I start crying and thinking about all the ways that I can avoid everything tomorrow. If I didn't have my esa with me I would be worse. But I don't understand what I should have done as accidents happen and I cleaned it all up and I'm going to replace the dish that broke. I don't understand why he has to treat me horribly. I'm lucky not staying too long bc I'll be moving back with my mom in a few months but has anyone else hadhas a parent that treats them this way,Personality-disorder
50889,Why do I always say to myself that my life doesnt matter? It happened lots of times in my life. I liked some girl and she maybe liked me too but my thought process was it doesnt matter that I like her its just me and I dont matter she is better off without me I will just ignore her or if something bad happens to me and I am like oh it doesnt matter its just me so its acceptableIts like I feel like my life doesnt matter and bad things happening to me and unhappiness is normal. In grand schema things maybe its true but I personally shouldnt feel like this right? My life should mean everything to me it literally is the only thing I will be ever living.,Personality-disorder
50752,How to not play the role of a therapist in a friendship? I've been thinking recently that most of my friendships have a pattern. It's always the other person sharing things about their life and me listening to them or consoling them or whatever.I don't know if the friends I've had have been bad listeners but it feels like whenever I try to share something about myself with people it kind of dies down and gets lost in time.How do I not play the role of a therapist in the relationships I form? I'm getting tired of this but also I don't know how to convey it to other people in a way that won't result in permanent damage.,Personality-disorder
50528,I'm screwed maybe many of you are too? One thing I'm aware of is after you've been disconnected from societal norms for a few years it seems very difficult to return. I tend to stay away from looking at other people's lives overall it is good but you also need an awareness of how far adrift you are and the standard you're compared against.The average person is socially active whereas were disengaged. They have a constant stream of chores hobbies events plans messaging circles. In a day some days I speak to no one and can't even find the motivation to do anything new even something like watching a movie I can put off. My point is that after a while when you look at the ''activity level'' of a normal average person I just feel inadequate. This is made worse reinforced by the fact that whenever i do try connect with others I get rejected thats because they can sense pretty early I have nothing going on for myself in these social areas and I am not so much like them. And thats the catch22 because people excluding you stops you ever having anything.I'm incapable of organising a fun life things like viewing someone in family gathering and getting along with large groups of people and creating a good impression are intimidatingnearly impossible for me. I'm behind in career life experiences life skills energy. It's just difficult to even get a footing iv been cut away for so long and many types have closed the door on me,Personality-disorder
51071,Does anyone know if AVPD would qualify for MAID in Canada when it opens to Mental Health conditions? In March Medical assistance in dying is opening up for people with conditions causing unbearable pain physical or mental they do not have to life threatening. httpswww.ontario.capagemedicalassistancedyingandendlifedecisionshttpswww.ontario.capagemedicalassistancedyingandendlifedecisionsI've gone over this at least a hundred times like tonight even if I get approved they have a new 90 day minimum waiting period so it will be a while regardless. I have to time to think which leads to all fun ideas of Wiley coyote jumping off my balcony and hitting the concrete awning over the front entrance 12 stories might kill ol' Wiley maybe or leave him in agonizing pain wishing for death. Imagine holding that little sign up to the camera but it's a little suicide note saying goodbye to no one. HahaBut I'm pretty confident I'm going to get approved I meet very criteria I've tried all the required mental health options counselling therapy community services etc. I don't have any psychological supports I am alone. That's more than half the reason I want to go this condition this brain it makes it so I will always be alone. The loneliness knowing you can never and never will escape you'll avoid every chance you have. But the pain doesn't have to be forever I don't have to keep suffering and if I don't get approved jokes on them. I don't need approval to kill myself I just know I'm going to fuck it up anyway. Ending up with my ankles snapped off trying to crack my skull open on the concrete but too fucking weak to get the pressure. I couldn't do it if I tried not because I don't want too. I want too I want too so bad that's why I'm applying for Maid but I need to do it. But I will fail because I always fail. I'll avoid because i always avoid. I'll pity myself and feel bad and get fucked up and cry and hurt myself and tomorrow will happen and my credit card will get more maxed out and death will come knocking again saying TODAY IS THE DAY DO IT DO IT FUCKING DO IT PLEASE DO IT. Constantly. That's my brain thousands of times a day screaming kill yourself. I love saying slit your wrists over and over again. Making tea I should slip my fucking wrists dum dum dum please slit your wrists. I don't even have a good knife I just say it for some reason to myself. I'm way less scared of cutting that jumping I am terrified of fucking that up. Damn Hamilton's and our slow trains lmao. That was the way I wanted to go when I was trying to do it as a teenager. The trains back home damn they were fast knock your fucking head off in one go. Instant. There were always Roses taped to the Red sign beside the opening. A lot of people had the same idea as me so at least you know it works right!But you can always fuck it up the fear that causes avoidance affects suicide too! I can't do it if I wanted to just like everything else in life I want to do. So if I just need to get approved get passed 90 days... ahh I'm fucked lmao. Where's the nearest train station haha,Personality-disorder
51173,If something bad ever happens to me there is a chance most of the people who personally know me in life would never find out I live across the country far away from any family. For the most part Im very lonely and have been lonely for the majority of my life due to all sorts is issues and trauma since I was a kid. I have a few friends that I occasionally meet but I dont regularly talk to outside of that. I rarely talk to my family as I dont have a close relationship with them. I went to college and met people there but I havent kept in touch with anyone from college after graduating.Most of the people who know me in life have no clue what Im doing or even how my life is right now. They havent heard from me in ages. If I ever went missing they would probably never find out. If I ever died the people who have known me in life would probably never find out. The only people who would know anything are my coworkers doctors and family. They would only find out if my work requested a check on me after not showing up for work for a while. Family would most like be notified through that. Doctors would only find out I was gone once I stop answering calls and showing up for appointments.This is just scary to think about. Ive lived alone my whole and there is a good chance I would die alone. Life just sucks man. Why couldnt I just have had a normal life?,Personality-disorder
51561,as to not be a burden i will now isolate myself. you are welcome! recently I've been distancing from my friend because I needed some space. but after a while I noticed they seem... happier without me. like actually laughing and smiling more they even started talking to a very cool person. and they even talk to other ppl in the group more often. so now I'm kinda isolating myself because well... i just want them to be happy. if being absent from their life is what will make them happier ill do that. seems like I'm just a toxic person that drains everyone around them.,Personality-disorder
50766,DAE struggle to talk to people they like? I've been focusing on identifying people I truly personally like in therapy. Or well. More like validating my own opinions but it always comes back to people. I have a net of people I'm really 'close' with because of the way my uni living was set up. And I'm realizing through a lot of questions that there are people I just don't actually like I'm surrounding myself with? Or people I want to interact with more that I know will make me happier compared to my current friend group.But I can't help but think that anybody I would actually enjoy talking to couldnt possibly like me as a result. I think it's become a selffulfilling prophecy. The more I criticise myself the more I pull back the less I interact with people and the world and the less 'worthy' I am. But the flavor of people I enjoy are the hardworking driven nice ones. They wouldnt gossip about me behind my back nobody cares enough to do that. But I would feel like such a charity case. When I'm doing okay it's okay. When I'm not I hate the thought that I'm forcing my prescense on these people. That my attention to turned towards how shitty and empty I feel all the time and not the other spicy things that give life flavor.,Personality-disorder

And then the man I was dating told me he was hitting it off with his ex gf again. And I started to spiral badly down the I'm not good enough hole.. although I'm not even looking for a serious relationship. Sometimes it's difficult to differentiate between normal human experience and my disorder in terms of what are socially expected feelings or behaviors in these kind of situations.,Personality-disorder
50841,how many people here have social anxiety as well? I keep forgetting that some of my vent posts are actually more to do with social anxiety than avpd at least it seems to be that way because people in here don't seem to relate to some of my posts so I guess it's more to do with social anxiety than avpd. Just wondering if u guys think you have both or just avpd. I'm a bit confused about how some people with avpd don't have social anxiety as I thought they went hand in hand but I guess not.,Personality-disorder
51247,Do you guys ever wonder why you couldnt have just had a normal life like everyone else? My life was normal until my father died at 7 and my mom left at 9. I experienced childhood trauma physical abuse emotional abuse verbal abuse and neglect by the people that raised me. Not only that I come from a strict religious immigrant family so along with all those issues I was never allowed to leave the house much. My family also never went out and did anything and they also never showed me any love or affection.This was my life growing up until I finally moved out at 22. Ive since been doing better for myself as Ive graduated college and have a career now. But the damage was so severe that I dont think Ill ever fully recover. My upbringing made me lonely that I never had many friends. Verbal abuse made me mute and unable to talk back so I cant talk with cluttering. I do not have much confidence or self esteem. I still do this day dont have many friends or much of a social life. I also have a hard time dating and at 28 still have not hooked up with a girl outside is kissing and making out.I look at my life and the look at everyone else. They all had loving caring parents siblings to play with and grew up with all the love and compassion in the world. They have many friends they have boyfriends they have girlfriends they dont have speech issues etc. They just seem to be able to live life normally unlike me.I did nothing wrong to deserve the things that happened to me as a kid as all of it out of out my control. But sometimes I ask myself why me? Just why? I was given only one life on this planet why did my life go like this? Why does everyone else get love and compassion while I got nothing but misery?,Personality-disorder

Hello lovely communityIm reading a lot about this mainly to understand the guy Im dating better who has AVPD!My lovely community please help me understand why it takes often over 24 hours to respond to a text from your loved ones?Is there specific content that triggers you to avoid replying I.e expression of feelings? Yet I hear that the AVPD community does enjoy getting reassurance.Sometimes it makes me feel like theres a lack of interest but I often end up getting a reply after all just days late . But its confusing to determine wether you are disinterested or just afraid to answer. Love to hear your thoughtsexperiences,Personality-disorder
50515,I rejected her even though I wanted her I made plans with a girl and we wanted to meet.I decided to cancel it and I told her that I dont feel good. Obviously she asked what is trying to get me as a some physical illness but in reality depression is trying to get me. I mean I really dont feel good I didnt lie its just not a physical illness.What I am suprised is that she instantly also said that we can meet next week. I thought she isnt interested and she is just messing with me thats also reason why I decided to cancel. I dont think that my depression will be cured until then.,Personality-disorder
50741,I wish I could thank every person that has shown me kindness Theres a lot of people that have been nice to me. People Ive worked or went to school with that would talk to me or smile at me I wish I could thank them for being caring and generous enough to acknowledge me most people ignore me which I dont mind and some people bully me. But I often think about the people that went out there way to be nice to me they would have got noting out of it they did it just to be nice maybe they could see I was shy and lonely and had pity for me so they would talk or smile or say good morning to me to make me feel like a human being even though people pitying me makes me feel embarrassed and small I appreciate it so much but Im never able to show it so I just pray for them every day and hope they are having amazing lives and I hope they know they are angels.,Personality-disorder
50894,Pet Peeve When people think I owe them conversation triggers my AvPD bad. Does anyone else get annoyed when either family or strangers get an attitude with you if you don't entertain their conversation? I can be civil and nice IRL. I'm not walking around telling people eff you eff this eff that. However the WORST ones are the people that think they are giving me golden advice like hey don't do drugs but they have never known me to do such things. It's painting me in a bad light for me to agree with the advice willy nilly. But the kicker is they get upset if I escalate and say I don't do drugs to begin with? Do I look like a crack head to them? They take it as me being immature and unable to take advice. So I am supposed to sit here and entertain disrespectful conversation with people giving me advice on not to be irresponsible and that's what makes someone mature? This has happened with strangers too where they think they can talk to me about avoiding marriage cause theirs suck or dating because of their own griefs. Whether I get married or whatever I do is not their business. I usually only get approached with stupid conversations like that by family. They get big mad when I shut it down. The only carrot they dangle over my head is money. I straight up rather be homeless than listen to me being accused of driving recklessly or my mom threatening about my insurance rates going up.

51130,the irony of it all I recently got diagnosed with AvPD after probably struggling with it for 8 years I thought downloading reddit would give me some kind of comfort as there are communities on certain topics on here that are easily accessible but as Im reading through posts I have zero desire to comment on anything or make any connection at all and exited the app with the thought of probably never replying to anything which is the irony of it all.

Like I dont really care if they think Im dumb or even like me at this point in my life but something about knowing people see me is terrifying.

Im 24M and its waaaay worse with women I feel like Im invading their space just looking anywhere near them to the point I dont even know what their face looks like after an interaction.When my best friend of 10 years comes over to watch a movie I will not glance in their direction the entire time and stay on my side of the couch. But I can converse just fine and not overthink my words at all. I also feel like I have tunnel vision when im in grocery stores and if I go to a restaurant I will be stiffly hunched over my plate staring at the wall the entire time. I just realized being blind would be kinda awesome and probably take away like 90 percent of my stressors. Okay this got way out of hand im baked goodnight and if youre reading this I love you,Personality-disorder
50786,AvPD moms and Dads Does anyone think their mother or father has AvPD? I am pretty sure my dad has it. I see little signs here and there sometimes and just what I've been told as well. He has a hard time finding a real job until he was 26. By real job I don't mean anything fancy I just mean fulltime steady work. He had a hard time asking store clerks where an item was located. When I asked him how he overcame his extreme shyness he replied that my mom bossed out it out of him. She has introverts in her family but they can be loud and opinionated as well. My dad will talk on the phone when necessary but would never have a 2hour phone call just for the sake of it. There is just other signs here and there.ampx200BHave you seen any signs in your mom or dad or other relatives?

But their friend didnt even want to say hi to me. Like my friend told him to say hi and he literally just said no . This happened a few days ago and Im like really upset about it.

51152,Going at your own pace I believe some days ago there was a post about being tired of importance of communication skills in life. Now there's kinda similar issue but with the pace that everything's is going with. Just my personal experience I am not speaking for everyone. So last year I quit college cus I couldn't bear stress and deadlines. I was pretty slow to understand and do things that was required professors or whatever they're called sry not sure were pressuring us a lot with all that and so on. I have a job as a stocker now but in about month or so I have to think about other options for studying collegesuniversities just some other field and that honestly makes my stomach twist. It's not about what I want it's about how it'll all go. I'd love to spend my time studying art but I am so afraid of the process. When I think about it I can imagine only flaws and mistakes I'd make. There would be so much things to learn and practice but so little time to do all that. And now to the title. I hate that everything must be spinning crazy like that. If you want to study you must be catching up quickly otherwise it's immediately your one big ass problem and no one is willing to help you with that. It'd so damn cool if there was any way to get education on your own pace so you have enough time for everything. I know it's only in my dreams but I can't stop thinking about it. I am so slow because my brain is so fried after all these years fighting this plague. I don't know maybe it's just me and I am that broken but it's really so sad that I can't normally go towards my dreams. And those fears aren't even irrational same shit happened year ago and I know myself so damn well it couldn't be any way around. Sorry for such long bullshit vent I had to get it off my chest,Personality-disorder
51491,Who is my first love? Have I fallen in love yet? As someone with AVPD I have trouble connecting with people. I know I'm smart and attractive and I care for people but it's my lack of social skills that make it hard for people to see the real me. I've had two guys like me back in the past few years. Which one of them would be considered my first love?The first guy Dave I met when I was 19 on vacation. He and I would just talk at the pool about politics and education even though he was kind of a party guy he has a nerdy side. We only hung out for two days but after our first day hanging out the second day he was really shy talking to me. But our romance was cut short because he had a girlfriend and made the mistake of spilling the beans about his crush on me to other kids at the resort. He cut off contact with me but when they broke up a month later he started looking at my social media a lot. Not to mention he made a playlist about me for my birthday. We don't even talk so I don't know if this is some sort of peace offering or apology. The second guy Steve I met a year later at my job. He and I bonded on the first day of work about growing up in the same hometown and I told my mom that day about how we bonded over our parallel lives. We worked together for a little over a year. And we never went out or anything but he would hit on me a lot. But stupid me was either too dense to realize he was flirting or too surprised in the moment to say any good flirting lines back. But a customer asked me for my number one day and I gave it to him. I guess I kind of wanted to motivate my crush to ask me out but literally the week after he went out with his sister's friend the sister set them up but they broke up and he likes me.View Pollhttpswww.reddit.compoll11wpn90,Personality-disorder
51481,AvPD diagnosed recently Hey all I was diagnosed with AvPD quite recently and finally I guess after all those years spent in confusion what is wrong with me. I finally got an appointment at psychologist we were doing for the first few hours screening process turned out I do have AvPD and I met all necessary criteria for being diagnosed with BPD. Also he mentioned that I do have some symptoms of schizophrenia and narcissistic personality. But after I read his diagnosis this evening he wrote that I have Other personality disorder. Which idk how I feel about that. Like I do not belong to anything even in this. And when I started to talk to him about feeling really depressed and about my suicidal thoughts earlier today he just said that we will talk about it next time in a two weeks. And I am so confused about this like no one really care especially with the suicidal thoughts. And feeling I do have no one to talk. Or maybe I dont want to? I dont know. But this is making me super super lonely and more depressed. No one really cares..,Personality-disorder
50901,Rescue fantasies Did anyone else have a lot of rescue fantasies when they were young and even today especially in regards to romantic relationships? I started having these rescue fantasies in high school and theyve been coming back into my life recently very hard. I was obsessed with the anime revolutionary girl utena as a teenager and into today in my late 20s. I saw myself so much in Anthy and I wanted someone like Utena to come into my life and rescue me fight for me and love me. Ive never been in a relationship but this is all I can fantasize about now is someone rescuing me and loving me. I recently found a music video like that that I sob every time I watch it but watch it multiple times a day because I want someone to rescue me like that so bad. httpswww.bilibili.tvenvideo2009722095,Personality-disorder

50986,claustrophobia attacks Can anyone relate to this no advice please? So I don't live alone I live a single family member that sometimes has their boyfriend over. I also do work part time in retail which is all I can currently handle. Our schedules usually allow me enough time alone even if I want more of it. Summer is a lot better for me because I can comfortably go outside in spaces where I'll be just as alone so it's extremely rare that I have these attacks during it. To get to the point there are some weeks in Winter that are a perfect storm for AVPD. Our schedules will clash where they'll be home every single moment I am for almost a week on end. For the first 34 days I'll get a bit more irritable but handle things and still do ordinary things that involve other people hearing me like music or watching youtube videos and keep up with people well enough online. Though it starts to snowball on 5 usually. The way it comes on is almost like a physical illness. I suddenly feel extremely on edge in the background I'll start not listeningwatching anything and avoiding doing anything outside my room hypervigilance shoots through the roof my mood begins to swing like a pendulum really snappy and in general human.exe stops working. I won't even be able to really handle having Discord open. Usually comes with tension aches too in my body here and there. If I even have to go out and get the mail I become a mental train wreck I won't be able to handle being outside even if no one else is out without being on the edge of a panic attack. just going into a different room becomes an anxiety ridden chore. Going to work as you can imagine as I must force my way through it is an absolute nightmare as you might expect. The anxiety and irritability completely socially cripples me to add to the embarrassment so I go through the usual motions like an NPC to the best of my ability and use that break time very strategically based on how time usually feels there. If I'm lucky I'll loosen up a bit much later at night enough to watch some youtube or enjoy some quieter music. The only way I found to cheat it which costs a little money unfortunately is to order takeout food later for some reason home cooked food doesn't work? I guess it's because I have to do that here with them around and have my usual comfort ritual of watching some youtube as I eat hoping someone is streaming something I like. After that I may feel alone enough somehow to enjoy some music and mindlessly fart around on the internet. Since the only factor is that it just involves someone elses comfort food they made for me I have no idea why this works. It's impossible for this to go on more than a week cause schedules break it up after a week and give me back that time but it can take me a day on my own completely to recover. I noticed this specific family member being home with me too long is the trigger though I don't know if it's just them or others that can trigger these episodes too. It's as if I become to opposite world nightmare version of myself because normally despite my AVPD and CPTSD I'm much more positive and bubbly in personality. As long as I'm self medicated correctly and have just enough space I tend to do ok socially. I feel more like a wounded extrovert than anything since I desire close connections but at the same time I avoid everything that would lead to any being formed because I feel closed in on very quickly. There's a lot of tug of war that goes on with me internally like this.,Personality-disorder

50669,I haven't been diagnosed yet I haven't been diagnosed with AvPD but I think I may have this disorder. I was always an anxious child then in my teens I started taking panic attacks before any social situation but mainly before going to school so I stopped going to school I just avoided it. I'm now nearly 30 and I've never held down a job for more than a couple of weeks and have dropped out of a few college courses due to having bad attendance. I feel like I now avoid anything that causes me the tiniest bit of stress by not leaving my house sleeping and not letting anyone know about it. I then get really depressed and disappointed in my self. It just feels like an endless cycle of me not showing and getting down about.

To my horror I found out later that it wasnt anonymous. I had no idea what AvPD was then but it is shockingly relatable to look back on now. Hard to post but it feels important that I do.I want to be understood but cannot be vulnerable.The one who shows their hand first loses.Carve into me and leave your markthe first one to strike feels betrayed mostThe retaliation is serratedBut I just wanted to know youwithout borders without painI just wanted to know youYou like me if you can assort melabel me and pin me downaggressive bitch salty witchinnocent dreamer batshit idealist.You color me all kinds of elegantbut when it comes down to itIm only an impressionist.I keep trying to break free of what comes naturally to mefind myself in the labels you offer mebut the mirror image is fake and so am II want to feel myself without your hand in my definition.,Personality-disorder

My mood plummets entirely I start becoming really mistrustful of other people's intentions I isolate and i completely lose hope in the future.

All I know how to do is play video games watch youtube and repeat the same things like a dumb monkey.The past 2 weeks I tried taking a course in computer science and I tried starting to learn Japanese. And all I can do is watch and wait for something to click in my brain.There's nothing in me.

50505,I can't cope with my job I work from home as a software developer most aspects of the job are too triggering and I cant handle it.Every morning starts with a daily update meeting. Since I usually had done only 030 minutes of work the previous day I have no update to give I panic and have to lie and the lie is transparent. Afterwards I have to cool down from the shame guilt and stress. Its already hard to recover from the procrastination because everything I do with the code or on Slack has a timestamp a notification and is visible to everyone. Once theres something Im avoiding committing code deploying code posting the code for review responding to someone testing code an upcoming meeting etc. I often go offline from inactivity and then Im afraid to even open my laptop which can take hours to overcome because once I do everyone can see Im online on Slack my procrastination then is immediately visible to the people who are impacted and who are looking for it i.e. people Im not responding to my manager.I already got in trouble for not doing my work missing meetings not responding to people for days or weeks and just not showing up some days without telling anyone. I was put on a monthlong probation which Ive gotten past only because I didnt ghost entire days during that time. I have frequent meetings with my manager and I have to pretend Im struggling way less than I am. I cant admit that half or more of the days I do absolutely nothing or how much communicating with people the most important part of the job so fundamentally terrifies me.I know every trick in the book about procrastination time management breaking down tasks but thats not enough when Im this afraid of people. Ive accepted I need help from another person. Ive talked about this some with friends but none of them understand so all they can provide is sympathy. I have a psychiatrist and Ive been trying to find a therapist but theyve all been unhelpful many actively harmful.I know it's a slow process but every single day at work is like torture and Im on very thin ice. Because I cant get the work done its not endurable and I dont have the time or energy to work on all the other parts of my life in dire need of work. I dont want to quit because I havent been here that long and I had a big gap between quitting my previous job for the same reasons.

I think oh fuck I said something wrong. I always say something wrong. I can't ever say anything right. I'm such aThen they'll reply. I chide myself for being so silly. Then do the same thing 40 more times within the same conversation. You'd think being proven wrong so many times would fix it but no. I always think Ah this is the time I fucked up.

51249,You really do have to be your own best friend I got rejected recently and it caused me to spiral really badly. My brain went straight into see I knew you weren't good enough ofc you're not their type ofc they only wanted you for your body nobody will want you romantically It got so bad that I started having physical pains. I had to literally interrupt that mean voice and say woah you're hurting yourself and you need to stop. It takes practice but it's very important to interrupt that shitty inner critic. Its going to look for any proof that you're not good enough and you have to challenge itSo I reminded myself hey maybe this person genuinely meant it when they said they're not ready for a relationship. I had to tell myself maybe they have their own emotional blocks that's stopping them. And I had to refer to my fav quote of all time when it comes to rejection you can be the ripest peach and there's always someone that just doesn't like peachesPlease if you're able to create that positive voice that challenges negative thoughts. It's not a cure ofc but over time you will start to have more compassion for yourself and your inherent value.,Personality-disorder
51466,This is a bit of a weird question but does anyone else relate a lot to these anime titles? Mushishi Kino's Journey etc I've always wondered if this is something AvPD adjacent. Mushishi Kino's Journey Spice and wolf Girl's last tour Serial Experiments LainThey are not really related in any genre way but all feature some sort of disconnect with the MCs and the rest of the world. It's like you're just traveling through it and never really putting down roots but instead just observing for a while and then moving on they all sort of have this somber undertone that you're not really a part of the world and just experiencing small parts of it. Most of them feature a pair traveling together which makes it feel less lonely but Mushishi only has the MC and that's the one that feels closest to AvPD in a weird way in my mind.Does this make sense?,Personality-disorder
50605,I recovered from AvPD. What will help others? I dont believe in matters of mental health ever truly being 100 cured.Even though I still have some AvPD traits that Im still working on my therapist says I certainly no longer meet the diagnosis of AvPD.Ive gone from being a textbook AvPD with such bad social anxiety I barely left the house an could barely order a cheeseburger.All through school people called me socially retarded and my mom thought I was autistic.To now being a very socially skilled confident outgoing person who makes friends easily.Im curious if people are interested in some kind of a write up about how Ive recovered from my AvPD what helped me how long it can take etc?I see a lot of people struggling and feeling hopeless on this board.It breaks my heart when I see people truly believe that recovery is impossible and spreading that false message. It is possible! Its just really hard uncomfortable takes a lot of time and you have to really want it.Thoughts on whether a write up is something people would be receptive of? Im also open to suggestions of what else could help.P.S. I feel vulnerable writing this post in fear that people will have an angry skeptical reaction or think Im being narcissistic. But I wanted to take the risk and reach out anyway because Im super passionate about recovery and Id love to see the negative narrative about AvPD recovery start to change.,Personality-disorder
50816,Is it just me? or trying to make a friend with someone who has a lot of other friends making me feel bad about myself Like I won't be accepted as their other friends like this person has a lot of other friends too and I'm totally replaceable so I start to panic and then try to end the friendship quickly like not intending to ruin it I just feel I won't be accepted I feel new I feel like I don't belong anywhere.. Like sometimes I feel I need someone who is just like me with no friends and totally weird in social world .. idk it's just the thought of talking to someone who is more like.. extroverted to other people making me feel sick like so fucking sick Like why and how do you talk to people? How did you even find this amount of supportive loving friends who accepted you? why that isn't me?.. I'm just so hurt that I dealt with since I was literally a child.. I hate myself so muchI have been diagnosed with AvPD last month and I didn't know what was it I think I have it combined with Anxiety and Depression and CPTSD as well.. I think I'm sure of this since my psychiatrist said that.Idk anymore what to do with my life.. I want friends who are like me and.. well.. LIKE me Idk anymore.,Personality-disorder
51216,I want to be there for others But I feel so blocked off. It's funny how I complain about people who are unavailable to me as I am unavailable to everyone else. Especially my younger sibling. I feel an overwhelming amount of guilt for how I treat him. I feel like I'm repeating the cycle that I went through. I completely avoid my younger brother and I've ruined our bond. He doesn't even look at me and it's my fault because I wouldn't even look at him. I'm sure that hurt him.It may not seem like it but I do try and care about him. When he does look at me I try to make sure I smile. I know how important that is for children. When he asks for a hug I'll give it even if I don't want to. When he wants to show me something I try to ask questions and give him praise for his creative works. I don't do this often enough though. I avoid him because I don't have much to give. Kids in general make me feel uneasy because they need so much from their caretakers I feel inadequate that I can't give them that. He reminds me of myself when I was younger and it makes me uncomfortable because I rejected that part myself a long time ago..Kids are authentically themselves until society molds them. I can already see it happening with him. He's quieter than he used to be. He doesn't look people in the eyes. He shuffles nervously. He stutters. He hides. All things I used to do when I began rejecting myself. I still do these things. My authentic self is locked away she's still there but shes completely hidden.It's like I want to save my brother before he goes down the same route as me but I can't even save myself. I just hope he can forgive me ,Personality-disorder

CBT DBT EMDR ketamine infusions Ketamine nasal spray TMS talk therapy and about a million other things. Its just been getting worse and worse. Now I cant even sing in the shower without the fear of my neighbors hearing me so I just dont sing. Cant sing in front of my mom. And I know I can sing I sang in a band for years when I was young and now it makes me nauseous to think about. I barely leave my house. If I go to a restaurant I think everyone is staring at me and judging me and I know they arent but my brain doesnt listen. If Im having a bad skin day acne wise then I dont leave the house even if I have shit to do. I physically cannot talk to strangers. I would give anything to not care what people think and to just be carefree. Im one step away from becoming an agoraphobicand I am a musician!! Its ruining my life like my friends dont even talk to me anymore. Im ready to off myself tbh because this shit is making my depression about a million times worse. And my autism tbh because I feel like my sensory issues have gotten wayyyy worse. And I just wanna know has anyone has success? Because I have no hope left. And I need some right about now.but my therapist and psychiatrist told me theres nothing else I can do for you.EDIT on anxiety meds Buspiron Xanax and Ativan and depression meds Nortriptyline and Ive tried everything else.

51142,I'm literally too awkward for therapy I'm doing CBT and my therapist always asks me what I'm thinking and all I can say is I don't know because my mind always goes blank. I can't articulate my emotions either and don't even know what I want in life.Today we did an exercise where I was supposed to have a conversation between my critical voice and my confident voice. I told her I'm extremely uncomfortable doing it and she said it's fine we don't have to but I wanted to try it anyways. I could think of hundreds of things I hate about myself but not a single thing I liked about myself. It was so awkward sitting there and not saying a positive thing. My therapist even asked me if I'm having any suicidal thoughts afterwards that's how bad I must have looked. When I looked in her eyes she seemed clueless like she's never seen anyone that bad and has no idea how to help me.I don't believe my problems are something I can fix by just changing the way I think about myself. I am not an interesting person. I'm not an attractive person. I just feel like there's nothing of value about me and people find me repulsive.,Personality-disorder

I couldn't give much clearer description of myself after reading the article and so I looked it up on reddit and surprisingly a subreddit exists dedicated to this. I desire to be alone and living on my own away from my family and people because I feel inhibited by them. I feel like I'm restricted and couldn't act my true self when I'm with them maybe because I'm afraid of being disliked by them? I'm not really sure and I'm still learning and knowing about myself. Am I the only one who feels this way?,Personality-disorder
50744,Opening up to my partner? I get sad frequently big surprise and there's some shit going on in my life and it feels like I want to talk to someone but it's really hard to open up. I want to tell my partner about how I'm feeling because they should be a support but Everytime I'm like what's the point. I think sometimes I think too logically about situations and I'm like what are they gonna do? At best they can say is sorry you feel that way and to be honest things like that aren't really meaningful to me. Does anyone else struggle opening up to friendspartner? I mean obviously we all have avpd so yes but do you guys have strategies?,Personality-disorder
51218,does anybody else get overly hurt and offended when somebody comments about how quiet you are? Ive been the quiet girl my entire life and I cannot tell you how many times during school and now work Ive heard people tell me how quiet I am. One of my teachers once called me the quietest girl theyd ever known and I would always get called a mute or asked if I ever talked. And I cant explain why but every time someone says that to me or even pokes fun at me for it I have to hold back tears and just smile or lightly laugh it off. I dont even know what to say when someone says that and it makes me feel even worse. I would even go as far as to say it ruins my day because my brain just fixates on that and tells me theres something wrong with me over and over and its all I can think about. I hate it. I know Im not normal I know Im quiet I know I dont talk much so why does it hurt so much when someone tells me that?,Personality-disorder
51093,Want to resign from my job Hey all Im really struggling at the moment and all I can think about is resigning from my role. Im a social worker who provides therapy to childrenadolescents with complex mental health difficulties. Ive been working at the organisation for 11 months now and roughly a week ago I changed my workplace location to be closer to home. Its the same service just a different location. Oh .. and Im acting in a senior position at the new workplace as part of a six month secondment. I thought that starting fresh would make me feel more motivated and confident however Im still feeling like an imposter scared and worried about criticism. Extremely terrified of social interactions too. Just knowing I have to see clients and speak to them gives me major anxiety. Im also on antidepressants and beta blockers which help a bit but I still dread the work that I have to do.All I keep thinking about is waking up in the morning switching off my mobile phone and driving far away to a relaxing environment like a beach pretending I have no responsibilities or cares in the world. I know thats not possible though.If I did resign I would make sure never to find a therapy role again as its not something Im too keen on and social interactions terrify me. Should I keep trying to work in spite of the anxiety I experience? I think Ive given it a fair shot and I cant take it anymore! Any advice would be greatly appreciated.. thanks!,Personality-disorder
50558,I suspect myself of having AvPD I am turning 17 in a month and a half and I suspect myself of having AvPD I am trying to do more research on the disorder I am not going to self diagnose but I am hoping people who are diagnosed can tell me more about the traits and what its like having AvPD.,Personality-disorder
50641,I love the idea of a romantic relationship but I cant put the work in. I 28M feel like any kind of datingrelationships is just work work work work work work. I like the idea of having a connection in my life but I dont think Im willing to do what it takes.I think bc Im so lowmaintenance I attract a lot of very clingy needy people which made me hate the idea of dating because theyd never leave me alone. And not just the process of dating itself which sucks for most people but just being in a relationship requires too much work and expectations. Maybe Im just lazy but how do you have the motivation to keep going with dating when its just annoyance?,Personality-disorder

51319,AvPD and Social Anxiety on the rise? It feels like AvPD and social anxiety are becoming more prevalent especially younger generations and that this was exacerbated by the pandemic. Even before the pandemic it was an issue with the use of social media fueling a rise in mental health issues but the isolation of the pandemic obviously made things worse.Maybe AvPD will become more mainstream in a few years?,Personality-disorder
50898,The feeling when a weight of dread is lifted? At least twice a week on average even for a brief period I am flattened by a crushing wave of fear and dread and anxiety to the point where I taste blood in my mouth. It's a sickening feeling like you know something awful is going to happen even though you also know it's not really life or death. But then sometimes that weight is lifted instantaneously through a conversation or email or text. My question is what is your physiological and psychological response to that weight being lifted? The anxiety leaves your body suddenly and then....sometimes I binge eat the opposite of stress eating. It's not to celebrate but to cope. sometimes I have a giddy hyper energsometimes like now it's just a solemn reflectionwanted to know how you all coped with the release of torment?,Personality-disorder
50631,What are you guys good at? Sometimes I forget I'm good at things it helps me to remember what ones since there's so much I feel like I'm not good at.

A good cook. I don't easily give up when something is difficult. Good at understanding amp applying new concepts easily. Good at drawing amp art.

51472,Does anyone find it so hard to get over a commentcriticism to the point they feel suicidal? Trigger warning. Mention of Eating disorders and suicide. A month ago my brother was talking about how he just turned 30. He was saying how he didnt look 30 and he pointed to me and said he looks older than me. Im 24. It felt like a stab in my heart. Ever since Ive barely left the house. I wasnt trying to date before that but now Im not even going to try. I feel suicidal now and I dont feel like lifes worth living. Im old looking for my age so I should just give up. That comment is running through my mind 247. Its torture. I feel so embarrassed. If my brother knew what that comment did to me it would suck. Im so angry but hurts. Its not really his fault how I feel but why did he say that. Ive struggled with eating disorders my whole life. I get anxious seeing my brother because Im scared of what he will say. Everything reminds me of that comment. I have barely been eating. It just reminded me why I shouldnt leave the house because other people will think the same. It feels like such a stupid reason to be suicidal over but its taking every bit of my energy not to do it everyday. How am I meant to go through life if a silly comment like that has gotten me like this. How do I get over it? Im not strong enough to go through life.,Personality-disorder
51375,Ok but what now? career change I am currently making a transition from being a barista and supervisor at a coffee chain to attempting becoming a baker. Retail has burnt me out to my core exacerbated my AVPD and I'm convinced making this change might help me feel more at peace in my daytoday because I have more control over my social interactions at work. However I am having a hard time maintaining contact with the bakeries I'm trying to be recognized by without running into those anxieties that lead me to putting off an email or stopping by to introduce myself for a little too long and thusly becoming what some would consider unprofessional in my communications. Would anyone have any advice to spare about how to 1 Apologize for the wait and possible inconvenience 2 When and how do I advocate for myself 3 if it's likely how can I save my professional relationships with others when I let my anxiety call too many shots?,Personality-disorder

50513,Ive got two degrees and both university experiences were almost identical in social sense It honestly amazes me how similarly horrific my social experience with the second degree was even though I KNEW the pitfalls and tried my best. Granted covid did happen as I started. Still dont know if it could have been different for me Im bitter to say the least.Both times it was something like thisFirst year I try to fit in but get all stressed out. People reach out a little I either avoid it or get in the situation act awkward and get back to avoiding.Second year I get a nervous break down heavy paranoia and practically speak to nobody. People stop reaching out.Third year I feel a little better in a who cares anyway kind of way I try to act like a normal person again but people make an effort not to even come in contact with me.

50724,I confronted my kid's teacher today My kid has been having issues with this teacher all year. They really struggle with concentration and memory and the teacher has been terribly unsupportive. It's the only class my kid has been failing.A few months ago my kid was diagnosed with cancer. We set up a 504 to reduce the amount of assignments and give them extended time.They were then out of school for two weeks for surgery. All of their teachers except the problem teacher followed the 504 and greatly reduced the amount of their makeup assignments.Regardless my kid worked hard to turn in a large portion of the assignments. Yet they're still failing that class.I emailed the teacher today to make sure she graded all the assignments. She told me she did but otherwise did not give me any helpful information in getting my child's grade up. I then asked if she has been following the 504 plan and I've not received a response.I've already been second guessing whether I was too aggressive in my emails but at the same time I feel like I'm going to have to escalate it with the school.I'm stressed and I've been fucking sick to my stomach all day. I'm cycling between anger and embarrassment and I'm going nuts.Just needed to vent Edited Thank you everyone for your encouragement. I've been in continued correspondence with the teacher. She stated that she has already reduced the amount of work but I still have issue with the amount and content.I also elaborated on the fact that my child has been having issues all year only in this class. My child has told me they're afraid of this teacher and they struggle with her teaching methods. The teacher had no helpful comments and has only repeated that the issue is missing assignments as if I don't have eyes. She also said she thinks they can turn this semester around if we can motivate them and thinks they are not having academic difficulties. This rubs me the wrong way because motivation starts in the classroom and she's clearly been lacking.PT conferences are tomorrow I'll be talking with the principal.,Personality-disorder
50886,When people are so surprised to learn something about you because you're so quiet I think we all know that feeling. When you reveal something about yourself and people are so surprised that you're also human. It makes me sad because it reminds me that people see me as this unapproachable amp uncool person when I have my own personality. It makes me feel disingenuous and makes me even more self conscious about how I come off.,Personality-disorder
51440,Finally deactivated Facebook. Where I am from everybody is on Facebook. That anxiety inducing place where I never feel safe and I feel hated invisible and dumb. Lately I've been spiralling and posted sad angsty posts to people who don't care about me. Thankfully I got only 60 friends. Facebook made me feel more alone. I'm disabled and I don't go outside and I struggle with texting. I just don't get it. I don't have the energy. I kept deleting my posts feeling more ashamed. I need it for something that's work related and still ongoing. But enough. I don't care if everyone is there I rather not feel like a burden and vent on Reddit. Having a profile with my name and face while I am utterly depressed? No thanks. It's not like I made any friends there. I really hope that my issues will be resolved and I won't go back and make a fool outta myself because no one cares.,Personality-disorder
51452,Youre still single man? Whats a young good looking guy like you doing wrong? My brain is broken. Im incapable of creating and maintaining close relationships either out of some awkward selfconsciousness or fear. Thats pretty much all there is to it. The fact that I seem pretty normalsmartathletic on the outside only makes things worse. People have expectations for me socially and I obviously dont meet them. So whats their conclusion? Hes weird something must be off about that guy. How can he have all this stuff but be so strange.Theyll never understand I just want to experience life like they do lol.

51522,is it wrong of me? i am not diagnosed with avpd. i think i have it but i wont say i have it. ive shown a lot of symptoms since childhood. im 18 and usually they diagnose people who are older so yea idk. ive posted on here several times and feel such a comfort with all the people who relate. ive lost friendships because of how i am. its so nice to feel understood and to connect with other people like me. i dont know where else to go to vent so i usually go here. all the people who comment really make me feel better since they get it.,Personality-disorder
51161,People say the most horrible things about me then wonder why I dont open up or feel comfortable to talk to them How and why would I try being friends with people who say Im an ugly useless fggot with no friends? They literally make fun of how lonely I am and talk shit about me .. who in tf is going to talk to people who obviously hate them. Like most people talk shit about me. When I try being nice and open they call me annoying weird or try to take advantage of me. When Im quiet and avoidant due to constant mistreatment they say Im weird and creepy and a loser Wtf do people want from me Im so ducking exhausted dealing with people. I feel like I cant trust anyone and the whole reason I dont try reaching out to people is because every time i thought I was friends with someone they talked shit about me secretly hated me.. how am I supposed to genuinely trust anyone after that?,Personality-disorder
50628,Just wonder if people have heard of hypersensitivity. Im a Highly Sensitive Person or HSP but I realized I was being super sensitive for awhile now. I think this is when I started to realize my AvPD. I was talking to my former therapist a couple of months back and she told me about it. Her friend had become disabled and was being hypersensitive. I think a lot of this comes from trauma. Also doesnt help when people arent really compassionate in general. I dont really have much advice but try to heal from traumas. Ive been doing that alot more lately. It took a really long time but I feel less stuck now.,Personality-disorder

50570,All I am is a useless burden I volunteer at a place that I like to help out at despite my debilitating anxiety because I like helping people plus Itll help me gain credit for my future job but for a few days I didnt show up due to sickness. Now im supposed to text them when I dont show up my manager? boss? made that very clear. She even gave me her personal email to text because she understood that I absolutely couldnt take phone calls due to anxiety. Now I may or may not have just skipped that part as Id hate to bother them with a text plus its embarrassing. So basically my school counselor who is in contact with my manager comes up to me and tells me that my manager was very upset and direct that I cant keep not notifying them when I cant go and I have one last chance or shed rather have me not help out at all. This of course I soooo badly wanna say traumatized because it feels that way but ive experienced trauma before to know that this experience wasnt actually traumatic really hurt me. All I wanted to do was help. I just wanted to be useful to someone for once and all I did was end up being a burden. I hate myself for this im scared to even go in again. If I cant even hold a volenteer position im sure as hell arent ever going to be able to get a real job when I get older. I fucking hate this disease its taking my life away.,Personality-disorder
51447,Feeling down lately It was my birthday the other day and it was a bit depressing. I spent it in the house eating a frozen pizza it was good though lol I didnt really do anything besides that and eating some cheesecake also good. I was hurt that nobody wanted to celebrate with me besides my momI dont have many friends besides a few online friends and lately i feel like they're distancing themselves from me and I deal with rejection sensitivity and along with the avpd I feel like its all eating away at me. When I see my friends talk to eachother or plan things without me it honestly hurts me and makes me want to cry. My friend says everybody cares and loves me but in my avpd brain its not true and that they all would be happy if i was out of their livesTo make this worse my therapist is moving soon and im scared i wont be able to find another therapist especially someone as nice and understanding as them. She has helped me with a lot and im scared i wont be able to find someone as nice and supportive as her. The last time i had a therapist who knew of my avpd they screamed at me and said i couldnt be helped...This is all just making me feel hopelessly depressed and feeling rejected ,Personality-disorder

51026,I Hate School I am currently in my second semester in college and I hate it. I am not the most intelligent person but I try my best. It's expensive but my scholarships cover it so I am going for free. I am very grateful that I have this opportunity but it is terrible. I started with a mandatory orientation where all we did was walk around and talk to each other. This was my personal circle of hell. I can manage in small groups but this was at least 30 people. A week of that.ampx200BI also had a class called you at school. It was ALL TEAM BUILDING. It was a showup for credit class and I almost failed because I wouldn't participate. I had to do a presentation and just started crying in the middle of it. I have never been more embarrassed in my life. I went to sit down and the girl next to me was patting my shoulder and asking if I wanted to go into the hallway for a bit. I don't like people touching me. ampx200BNow as a recovering addict I have another Layer of Isolation. Everyone is in their my mom is not here let's party phase and I can't be around any type of substance without jeopardizing my sobriety. So I can't just show up to an open party or talk because that's all people do now.ampx200BI also have a class that's just discussion groups. It is 12 people so not as bad as my larger class' except no one talks. It's just the TA repeating the same question prompt over and over till someone speaks up. I wanted to fill the awkward silence so I said something and now I am expected to talk all the time. ampx200BI hate talking. I wish I had an invisibility cloak to go to class with. I am ruining my education because I can't function properly. And I am so jealous of others around me. I want to be happy like them.,Personality-disorder
51064,Splitting ? in AvPD?? 18F just a disclaimer I havent been formally diagnosed yet but I relate to AvPD in so many ways that I cant dive into right now. I relate way more to AvPD than social anxiety but of course idk for sure.But anyway I was wondering if people with just AvPD experience something like splitting that occurs in BPD after feeling like someones rejected them or criticised them.For example I was having a job interview and the people interviewing me seemed really nice and I really really liked them but as the interview went on I felt like their body language and tone of voice showed they were criticising and judging me. After I felt that its like a switch flicked and I hated them. Absolutely hated them. I was so mad internally and all I could think of was how mean they were even tho they literally didnt do anything. I was so angry and I just wanted to break down and cry because I also hated myself too for embarrassing myself and looking weird and ruining my chance to get hired.Anyway I got the job and I love them again and cant even imagine ever hating them. This sort of thing happens to me all the time with almost everyone in my life and its so confusing!!! Except I thought it was only a BPD thing or could it be a mix of both or complex PTSD??Does anyone else experience this often too?Also Im seeing a therapist and psychiatrist really soon and Im not self diagnosing,Personality-disorder
50696,Being vulnerable sucks I opened up to coworkers about being bisexual and it feels AWFUL feeling so vulnerable and exposed. It feels really bad giving people ammo to judge you.

50791,I realize I am the problem. The thing is I long have realized I am the problem. But I dont want to bother people anymore with my problems. My AvPD is becoming so much worse five months into my first job. I just dont want to bother people yet people keep talking sht about me. Its justified because I keep making the mistakes I shouldnt and I feel stupid alone and nervous all the time. I thought about just trying to smile and improve. Even though my job is tough I thought if I pushed through it would be okay. At the very least my co workers were nice. My supervisor doesnt like me. But Im getting more and more tired. Its like the longer I stay the more my anxiety and depression flares up again. I keep avoiding people for no reason trying to be alone in a workplace where theres tons of people. When people look my way I get so scared of what they are thinking. My hands begin to shake when I do tasks now. Its quite silly because the only reason I am anxious is because of my own incompetence. I just think at this point it would be better if I just leave once my department hires new employees. Tldr Silly rant because Im dumb amp hate my job,Personality-disorder
50686,Nobody Knows It But Me Like a clown I put on a show The pain is real even if nobody knows Now I'm cryin' inside and nobody knows it but me The lyrics from the song Nobody knows by Tony Rich Project has always really stuck with me. It illustrated perfectly how Id felt for such a long time. It hit me like a load of bricks how beautifully it described that feeling. A feeling that Id struggled so much to put into words was put so simply and it brings tears to my eyes even now. How sad it is that only You would know this feeling and nobody could relate. It's a tragic love song actually but some lines of the song just resonate with me as someone with AVP.httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vPf0BA5IA9Ihttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vPf0BA5IA9I,Personality-disorder
51549,Feeling like I don't do enough I'm not sure if this is due to the disorder or not if it's imposter syndrome if it's from old Christian mantras of put others before yourself being baked into my psyche since childhood or if it's a combination of all three but I often feel like I don't do enough for other people in my life. Whether it's with other family members close friends or coworkers I often get this sense. I work from home. And I've done a lot on our current project over the course of this past year. But now that we're sitting near the finish line almost ready to golive with not much else to do other than wait for the cutover I can't help but feel some kind of guilt like I'm not doing enough. Even though I helped our team make a ton of progress in the past few months. With friends or family it often comes in the form of should I be there? or I know I be there be present but I really don't want to and then I just feel like a POS terrible friendsiblingsonetc. for not doing it. For example a relative of mine had a gender reveal party a few weeks ago. Naturally I didn't go. I'm not particularly close with this family member and haven't been for years. Nonetheless I still felt like an asshole for skipping. Especially later when I talked to my dad and asked how it went I asked who was there? and he said Just about everyone. Except for you. I don't think he intended to make me feel guilty but it kind of did. My mom corrected him later and pointed out a few other family members that didn't make it but nonetheless I felt like I didn't do enough. Even though again this relative having the child and I don't really talk or show interest in one another's lives anymore. Another example is a friend a close friend who really does their best to help me get out of the house and do things. They'll invite me to things at bars or restaurants and 9 times out of 10 I don't go. Part of me appreciates the hell out of that because I need it and it's nice to be includedwanted. Another part of me wishes they'd leave me alone because I don't think I'm interesting enough or worthy enough to hang out with. Then I start feeling a whirlwind of guilt and shame for bailing out of the request. Wondering if all these feelings of guilt or shame are part of the disorder or if it's something else. Anyone else experience this?,Personality-disorder
51299,First real date We walked in the park for like an entire day then the next day watched a movie. We kissed which was my first time doing that cool. But it turned out she wasn't as into me as I was her. So its over all for the best. I'm feeling so positive about it. It was painful for the first couple days after no lie but now I feel great.I was so worried that I wouldn't be able to make a move sexually but I did it. It was awkward as hell obviously but I did it. I was bold as fuck. And it was really no big deal. I saw her again the other day and it was totally cool no hard feelings.I finally feel like a real living human being. It's like I've been set free in a major way. Only a year after I asked out the first person haha. Feels like a lifetime ago. I never thought I'd actually get here and I'm so grateful that I did. And I have so much time ahead of me. I'm only 24. I used to look at the future and see only dread and misery but now I see hope and promise. Thank you thank you,Personality-disorder
50837,I act like a child and idk if it's just me or because of avpd People have commented before on this and what it is is that I basically look up to people in the way a child would look up to an adult and I do this because I admire how other people my age act like real adults and are confident and capable of doing adulty things. I absolutely am not a real adult despite my age.I also tend to want these people to look after me a bit make me feel safe protect me from other people because I view them as competent whilst I'm essentially an over grown child. I suppose this could stem from childhood trauma where I didn't feel protected maybe so I now try to hide behind other people to feel safe. I don't know if anyone else experiences this. I've never seen anyone talk about something like this before so I fear I'm just a complete weirdo . I'm not sure if this is actually a sign I have dependent personality disorder or something instead of being avpd related. Hopefully you guys can let me know if this is avpd related or not.,Personality-disorder
