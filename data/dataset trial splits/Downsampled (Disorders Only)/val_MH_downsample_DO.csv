34033,Convinced I'm dying. First post in here very nervous so it'll be long winded.On Monday I had pain under my armpit and across my chest on the left side. I convinced myself I had everything from breast cancer to heart failure. Went to the doctor on Thursday and she diagnosed me with shingles. My rash is more like a cluster of spots and it's not itchy or have any of the other symptoms.Since then I've convinced myself my organs are failing and that I have a blood clot.The latest is breast cancer. Was in the shower and noticed a small about an inch long patch of skin that's red. No itch no rash spot or lumps. It's not hot to touch. It's just red skin. The thing that's throwing me is that it's on my right side whereas the shingles is on the left.I've alway suffered with anxiety but never health anxiety. I've just bought a house and I'm moving in on Friday I'm starting to think that because I'm not stressed about that I'm stressing about every single twinge in my body. For example I'm now extremely dizzy. It's a side effect of the anti vitals but I'm here writing a will.Somebody please tell me I'm not going crazy. ,Anxiety

I recently had been dealing with acid reflux doc believes to be due to IBS which had me on a tear and now I'm dealing with this.Now I'm having a non stop tingling cramp ish pain in my inner thigh and knee and sometimes pain in my hip and it doesnt seem to be relieved by anythingI'm doing antiinflammatory pills stretching ice compression..

33971,Drawing light pain in right testicle HiI sometimes get a light drawing pain in the right testicle. It doesn't hurt a lot but it makes me really nervous sometimes.It would help me to understand where this may come from.The right one also sometimes slides into my groin during intercourse or ejaculation. It comes back out rather easily but is really uncomfortable. Is this normal? Can it be related to the light pain?,Anxiety
34088,Deep scratch from unvaccinated cat Hey so last night I got a deep scratch from a cat on my thumb. It was bleeding quite a bit until I cleaned it up and bandaged it.The cat was born to a stray mother at my friend's parents store and was adopted by my friend as a kitten. It hasn't been vaccinated and is about 6 months1 year old. My friend and his family have been scratched quite a bit by the cat as well but not as of late. It's a house cat and rarely ever leaves the house.I keep looking up various diseases I could be exposed too cat scratch disease rabies etc. The wound itself looks fine thankfully been over 12hrs. Should I be worried about anything? Any symptoms I should look out for? I want to ease my mind and stop worrying but I can't seem to..,Anxiety

34147,Can 247 anxiety cause brainTumor like symptoms? 19Yo male here I eat really healthy and exercise regularly everyday just to preface. I've always suffered from severe anxiety particularly health anxiety and depressionto less of an extent I remember at 12 the fear of testicular cancer just plaguing my every thought for months because of a dull ache in my testes.Anyway just before i started university for the first time a friend died of brain cancer and all of my close friends' moms died of breast cancer when I was young so I have a warped perception of how common it is I guess. Aside from this my life has been filled with death my father is terminally Ill my mum was suicidal and almost died of blood poisoning my grandma had vascular dementia and we cared for her at home until her death more beyond this grandparents friends' parents uncles and aunts.My anxiety since starting uni has worsened I suffer an elevated heart rate and sweats 247 extreme worrying thoughts all the time trembling hands especially bad at night. I've not had any memory issues or coordination issues it's literally just headaches for the past few weeks I've been getting pain in very singular spots never a full over generalised headache it lasts for a few seconds to a minute and then disappears and this happens a few times through the day. The kicker is if I CAN remove myself from my anxiety it doesn't really happen I was shopping all of yesterday with my girlfriend and didnt have any issues at all until we got into a quiet taxi at which point my thoughts went rampant.I just feel like my anxiety is killing me and it's really spearheaded into this fear of a tumor. I sleep awfully too because of my anxiety and grind my teeth severely as well as holding my shoulders up and tight all the time. EVERY rational part of me says it's all a mental thing but I cannot get that rational part of my brain to win over I'm in constant states of terror and get these huge adrenaline rushes physically crashing over me daily.Should I see a doctor? Should I be hugely worried from the point of view of a Tumour? I've finally after years managed to bring myself to see a therapist I start next week I've just always felt myself as being a drama queen but my life isn't even enjoyable anymore I'm so sickly worried all the time. Thanks Edit my mum also suffers from severe anxiety and depression not sure if this has an impact my dad is due for huge open heart surgery this year could it be affecting my subconscious? Table death rate is quite high.,Anxiety

34073,Health anxiety due to unexplainable scars on face skin In late 2016 I went throught a very bad episode of depression and health anxiety which lasted a couple of months. Managed to tell myself that everything is alright and ignored all kind of twitchespains that were temporary that use to bring anxious people like me a lot of bad thoughts.Since around summer 2017 I started noticing small scars and little holes appearing on my face skin for no apparent reason. I have no acnee or other skin condition I always had clear and clean skin. I went to a specialist and he couldnt put a diagnose tested me for some antiimmune stuff which came out fine.I'm trying to ignore it but every few days a new hole appears and its destroying my face a bit at a time. I think I will soon succumb to the thoughts and lose it again in front of health anxiety.How do you people put up with apparently minor issues that bug you for long periods without knowing why it happens? Do you just go on about your life?,Anxiety

33893,This is killing me So i had a bacterial stomach infectionpain in the right side thought it was appendix. Doctor gave some antibiotics and the pain went away. But that infection gave me health anxiety for life.Ive been having excessive gas since a month which is mostly due to stress. I was convinced i had stomach cancer but no black stools or blood and Im 20 so doctor ruled that out.Then i was convinced that my kidney failed but no. I googled a lot that night and was sure of it woke up breathless that night.. insomnia took over.Then i was convinced that i have brain tumorgoogle is evil but havent really had even a single symptom.The only concern now is insomnia has been a month now I generally get 68 hours a day but wake up once or twice a night Im generally a deep sleeper.Any solutions?,Anxiety
33900,Extreme tiredness all day every day Lately I've been sleeping 12 hours a night and I wake up extremely tired I can't move for hours because of the overwhelming tiredness. I keep falling back asleep after I hit snooze and I have intense dreams right away then my alarm goes off again and the same repeats until I drag myself out of bed because I'm too hungry. I am extremely tired all day as if I had multiple sleepless nights in a row while I actually sleep 11 hours per night. I'm Feverish but no fever most of the time I feel like my forehead and eyes are hot and heavy cold chills with sweating extreme fatigue muscular pain all over. I feel like I can't function properly I'm sluggish and think slowly my mind is clouded. My eyes keep going out of focus randomly. When someone talks to me their voice echoes in my head as if it was waking me up while I'm already up and awake. I randomly start falling asleepzone out even when standing up and get a falling sensation when trying to resist. It's true I had insomnia for awhile and whatnot but I don't know why I keep being so tired now that I am sleeping. I do wake up multiple times per night because my mouth is dry or because I have to pee or other things but it's not really new. I think my sleep is just not normal or something is very wrong with me.I'm tired of being tired. I've convinced myself I probably have leukemia anemia sleep apnea narcolepsy or something else. I don't even have the energy to go to the doctor.Am i dying?Edit I've been taking Nexium for 5 months and the leaflet says it can mess with your white blood cells causing intense fatigue pain all over and a fever. It can also cause hyponatremia hypomagnesemia hallucinations insomnia Etc. maybe that's the culprit? The side effect list also reads Sleep disorder what could it mean?

33933,One hell of a year Hi just discovered this subreddit and wanted to sort of share my experience with this. For the last 7 months or so I was totally convinced I had some sort of cancer. It all started when noticed a swollen lymph node on the side of my neck. The lymph node had been swollen for about 2 years and i never thought anything of it until i went to ol' Dr Google. Fast forward countless doctors appointments a spur of the moment ER visit CT Scans and an eventual biopsy and it turns out I don't have any life threatening conditions. I got so obsessed with cancer that I started going to dermatology clinics because I was convinced that some of my moles looked suspicious of course they were fine. I mean I worked outside a lot without sunscreen and a permanently swollen lymph node is unusual so I guess I was right to be somewhat concerned. However I really blew it all out of proportion for a long time and despite all evidence pointing to being healthy I cannot shake this sense of impending doom that I've had for the last 7 months. It's honestly making it hard to move on with my life and enjoy things. Anyone else have issues like this? How do you deal with it?,Anxiety

33901,2018 already panicking... So last year I had multiple blood tests an Xray and an ultrasound due to abdominal pain. I was also getting pains in my legs and weird hot sensations too. Doc said bloods were fine no lymphoma or leukaemia or diabetes and nothing else to worry about. Here I am 2 months later and Im getting pain in my left arm too. In the muscles specifically. No idea of the cause. Worried as fuck. Also keep waking up itching since I had oral thrush and took some meds left me itching on and off and had a rash this morning on my arms. Anyone have any ideas. All I can think is strain of some kind or low vitamin d but Id expect that to show up in a blood test. Totally stressed about it all. ,Anxiety

33946,Distraction techniques? I suffer from extreme health anxiety my main fears being that I will spontaneously drop dead from a heart attack or stroke. If I feel my heart acting up from palpitations or if I feel like my face feels strange it will send me off the deep end. It's so frustrating that I fixate on this every single day. I would love to hear how everyone distracts themselves when they are at the peak of their anxiety. Sometimes watching a light hearted show like Family Guy helps me. A lot of times if I'm talking to a friend on the phone I won't even notice any of my symptoms which I take as a sign it's all in my head!. I feel like my health anxiety is the worst at night when I'm laying in bed and all I can do is hyper focus on my body sensations. So everyone Let's hear how you deal with it in the moment!,Anxiety
34144,braineating amoeba??? long story but i got a septum piercing and it requires that i clean out my nose with soap and water. i've been using the tap for a couple of days to rinse my nose out but i realized that i could pose a risk to amoebas in the water. i live in new york and since it's january i know it's not very likely but i'm still in a LOT of fear that i've sealed my doom. i'm positive that it hasn't gotten up my sinuses but can it travel up my nose? ,Anxiety
34040,Stain on neck I noticed something on my neck about a month ago. It looks like a pimple what seemed to be a yellow bruise down below it. I then forgot about it because I then started worrying if I had colon cancer because my stomach would make noises non stop. After my stomach issues cleared up by themselves I noticed my neck and the stain got darker and a bit bigger. For the past week or so Ive been constantly looking up melanoma and now I feel like I have it. Ive been obsessing taking 50 pictures a day of my neck crying it able to eat properly feeling like Im going to faint shaking and not being able to be happy with my wife and daughter. I spoke to a virtual doctor and said I should get tested to see if it is melanoma and Ive been crying and worrying all day. I feel like Im going insane and the thoughts of suicide have crossed my mind at least once because the thought of leaving my wife and daughter behind and the fact that Im only 26 scares me so much. I want to grow old with my wife and thinking that I might die so scares me so much. Im going to an actual doctor tomorrow and I cant handle it. I dont know how Im going to be like at work. I constantly keep googling and once I start I cant stop. I feel like I have melanoma and its already to late because it might be advanced. Im scared and all I want to do is cry and not move. I just want to be in bed and hold my wife and have her tell me that Im going to be okay over and over again. I just needed to vent. ,Anxiety

No need to get into details I'm just anxious for my health and a family member's health I hate that I project my HA to other people as if I didn't do enough worrying as is.I went to the gym despite getting shitty sleep last night and feeling AWFUL all day because I knew it was better than coming home from work and ruminating. And I'm about to listen to an anxiety podcast and a guided meditation for sleep. So there are a couple wins despite the day being a dud. But I just wanted to write it out that today sucked and my worrying sucks and I hate it. I know I'm not alone when I come here and for that I am grateful.

34199,180 on Health Concerns For a few months I had headaches several times a day and thought nothing of it. I mentioned it in passing to my husband who insisted I go to a doctor. Long story short I was diagnosed with a pituitary tumor. Very easy treatment and no major concerns with it. The twist is the medicine I take for it has a side effect of increasing anxiety. For me this has manifested into Health Anxieties and 99.9 of the time at night when Im trying to sleep. Ill feel a pain in my leg or think I have an elevated heart rate or or or etc. I hate that Ive gone 180 from being so passive to now fearful or obsessive.

34150,Sharp headache everytime I move or cough Figured I could come here for enlightenment since I'm currently kind of on holiday. I'm 23 female and about a month ago I contracted one of the worst flus I'd ever experienced in my life in fact I'm pretty sure I've never gotten any kind of flu before this one I'm almost never sick. I only fully recovered about a week or two ago and I've noticed for the past few days a sharp pain on the top of my head everytime I cough or movechange elevation. I figured it may be because I've been sleeping a lot and not drinking enough water perhaps but I don't know. I took a pain killer a few days ago for the same kind of headache but it didn't help. Naps make it go away but not fully I can still feel some kind of pressurelight pain when coughing and moving. I'm also currently on my period which started a few days ago. Not sure if there's any correlation. Is this normal after a flu and a somewhat consistent cough? I haven't really gotten out of the house much the last couple of days either. Maybe I should?One notable thing in my medical history that I still have I believe is iron deficiency. Not sure if that could also be a testament to whatever this is.,Anxiety

34137,Kind of freaking out because of mild night sweats Im a healthy 18 yo male that probably has anxiety issues including health anxiety. Ive never seen a doctor specifically for it because it has never really gotten in the way of my life just occasionally my head. Anyway Ive been experiencing some mild night sweats the past couple days. I wake up an hour or two after going to sleep and my shirt is generally damp. Its not enough sweating to change sheets or anything but sometimes I have to remove my shirt. Ive had on and off night sweats in the past that freaked me out such as last winter when I almost convinced myself I had some type of cancer because well a quick search on google led me to Mayo Clinic and... I think you can get the rest this might have been a good time to see a doctor about anxiety.... Also I had some mild night sweats for a while last month but after I returned home from college they miraculously stopped. Last night was particularly bad in that my shirt was definitely soaked when I woke up in the middle of the night but I just took it off and after stressing over it for a couple minutes got myself to go back to sleep and woke up with no more sweat. I should emphasize that when I really wake up like in the morning I do not wake up sweating. Should I be concerned about this given that Ive had them occasionally before probably when I was really stressed out with school and that theyre pretty mild? I dont want to ignore it if it could be a sign of something bad but I want to stop freaking out about it too. Again these are not beddrenching like google says is a problem. Oh and to make things even more annoying I feel like Im coming down with a cold or something... everyone in my school it seems is getting sick. So throw those symptoms together and you have an overly anxious kid. Thanks for any advice.,Anxiety
33891,Listening to your body? I'm curious how those of us with health anxiety can listen to our bodies. It seems the general advice when trying to figure out what's wrong is listen to your body you know it best you tell your doctor when something is off. But it doesn't really work that way when I'm convinced every itch means I have lymphoma or a pimple is a tumour...so how can people with health anxiety know when something is wrong?! I am starting to hate that I just want to trust my doctor is right when she says I'm fine!,Anxiety

46185,2019 resolution be S.T.A.B.L.E. Hey friends! We made it through another year. Im really proud of us. Ive officially made it past the one year mark of my major manic episode post diagnosis. 2018 was really hard as I was in a depressive episode and had to work through medication and side effects for the first six months. I started a new job in September and started taking improv classes in May. Things are finally at a relatively calm placefor the first time since my husband and I got married in 205 it looks like we might have a nice quiet year without any major life changes that happened to me in prediagnosis manic episodesWe know that stability is never guaranteed. My goal this year is to do everything in my power to stay stable and be able to steer through an episode ifwhen one comes up. So what does stable mean to me?S Sleep. 810 hours one hour without electronics in bed by 1030 out of bed by 730 T Therapy. Going to personal and couples therapy meditation journaling being kind to myself through self talk. A Activity. Working out consistently more walking and biking as transport being outside moreB Balance. Work vs life alone vs social self care vs being productive comfort vs growthL Learning less tv more books and hobbies. More improv!E Eat healthy drink water take meds and vitaminsIts a tall order. Im probably not going to be able do to all the things all the time but its easy for me to remember and my ultimate goal is to be healthy. What about you?,Bipolar
45657,Hypomanic phaseshypersexualitysocial suicide disclaimer I understand that this post is insanely long but I feel condensing it will dilute its message. Some of this is unrelated to my bipolar II but it still plays a central role in my issue so I felt this would be the best place to post this plus I don't know where else to post. Little new here. I've been suffering from the symptoms of bipolar II along with social anxiety since my early teens so throughout middlehigh school it crippled me socially. My rapid awkward allovertheplace speech in my hypomanic phases and my mumbly confused speech in depressive phases if I even spoke at all along with anxiety kept me from really connecting with anyone and i was never able and still am not very able to display my true self something that crushesdepresses me to this day. It also SERIOUSLY held me back academicallyathletically. I was a straightA student with a promising competitive swimming career up until around 9th grade when my disorder had grown to an unmanageable level due to it going untreated and it continued to for the rest of high school with my relatively strict parents calling it bullshit at every turn and never getting me in any counseling or put on any meds until i dropped out of college at 18. Only then did they listen and see an issue. Knowing that I never realized my potential in any area of my life sends me flying into bouts of extreme depressive episodes in which I cry over what could have been and it can last days. I only thought I had depression at this point so I was misdiagnosed for another year. Now at 20 I am finally diagnosed properly and on a mood stablizier although it hasn't been particulary effective and smoking weed and dropping acid probably doesn't help matters. But I must admit that my first couple trips allowed me to take inventory and understand that I've been bouncing between manicdepressive phases since childhood and that my issue quite possibly extends into sex addictionhypersexuality. And it brought certain behaviors and memories to the surface that I wasn't willing to face and it's a big reason why I'm even here posting this I DO NOT condone the use of LSD especially for the people on this subreddit. Now we get to the main point that the title addresses not sure if I had to give ya'll my life story first.Throughout my adolescent life a common theme has been my complete and utter lack of control of my sexual impulses resulting in shameful behavior that I keep buried away from many public masturbation. At the beach with a towel over me in the nearest public bathroom and even IN CLASS. I knew it was disgusting as I was doing it but simply HAD to get off constantly like some nympho. I could only dart to the bathroom throughout the day so many times our monthly hall passes gave us a limited number of times to leave class. After reflecting I feel that this urge was aggravated by a combination of my hypomanic phases which involves being too horny and my hypersexuality bringing my sex drive to an INSANE level. If this is the case then it would explain that behavior. It doesn't justify it but it gives insight into how this happened. And teachers did NOTHING to address it. Unless the kid's autistic I would have confronted me about it if I were in their shoes and it may have gotten me the help I needed sooner. Because they turned a blind eye it continued to fester and get worse. I understand that it's not their job to counsel me but such extreme behavior warrants attention I was very sick and nobody helped me. There is one exception in which we were watching a movie in class a year after I discontinued my inclass meatbeating. A risque scene comes on and my teacher promply says Ok settle down John. to which the class erupts into the most intense laughter I've ever heard that rings in my ears to this day. So if anything they made it worse. I quickly became known as that creepy kid that beat it in the back of class bc well.... I WAS that creepy kid that beat it in the back of class. I never stared at some chick's ass to set it off mind you if anything I blocked out the world to focus on my animalistic impulses. So if anyone wants to call me a gross creep save it bc I'm already aware But this realization that it may not have been my fault that I'm not a complete pervert really makes me feel better and could bring me at peace but I feel I cannot confirm it without getting some outside opinions and I don't want to go to anyone else friends family etc. other than my psychiatrist bc I'm so shameful of it and I fear they would look at me different for the rest of my life. I've just been hurting for such a long time and I'm desperate to get answers about this bc I'm too hung up on it and I likely will continue to be until I come to peace with it.Thanks,Bipolar

45661,What's your long term medication plan? Do you plan to take meds indefinitely? I know this sub tends to be pretty promedication but the idea of being on them for life seems very daunting.It's that feeling they restrict dumb down in some way and are likely harmful in the long term.Like the idea of eventually tapering off and giving it a go especially now off the nonlegal psychoactives which were the primary episode triggers.,Bipolar

It works well compared to ambien but I moved to another state and havent been able to find a psychiatrist under my network. Im running low on my prescription from my old psychiatrist and fear another manic episode may occur if I dont get enough sleep. Im thinking of weaning off what I have left to prep for this.,Bipolar

45651,Just got my med approved my insurance Some of you know that I've been on saphris and lithium for the past year with really really good results. I've never felt this stable in my life. My insurance company sent me a letter late last week saying they would no longer cover saphris and I'd have to try a small list of acceptable APs... most of which I've tried the last of which wouldn't work for other reasons. After several days of phone tag with my doctor and two pharmacies she was able to get a hold of my insurance... and convince them I'm their client seriously? and she just called me back to say it's been authorized. I can stay on saphris.I had given up. I was already thinking of the worst case situation and let's be honest kinda freaking out. I'm just posting this because I want to give hope to anyone who is in the same situation and I want to remind all of you to freak it if the worst comes to pass not in case the worst comes to pass. Anxiety is a bitch and I'll probably struggle with it for the rest of my life but I can also choose to counter my anxiety with rational positive thoughts. I can reframe the situation. I don't need to be a slave to my own worst case thinking. Has anyone been able to get psych meds specially approved? Just curious about your experience.,Bipolar

45865,Can't Pinpoint MoodsFeelings... Hi everyoneI'm very new here so please forgive me if this has already been discussed...I was recently diagnosed and prescribed Lamictal this happened two days ago. I've been seeing a counselor for some other issues and she recommended going to psychiatrist.My therapistpsychiatrist recommend keeping track of my moods. This seems so easy...So I write down how I'm feeling or rate how I'm feeling. I've been trying to do this for the past month. I have found it so hard to identify my emotionsmoodsfeelings.I sit down and either use an app Dayio Evernote... or a physical notebook to start my journaling. I get in my own head so much that I can't seem to figure out how I am feeling. Lately it feels like I am making it all up. I overthink it all so much that I think Oh nevermind...I'm fine and just move on with my day. I guess my question is...how do others track their moodsfeelings? Are there are tips that you have for someone recently diagnosed and feeling like they have still made it all up even though logically I haven't? Have other experienced this?Thanks a bunch!,Bipolar
45891,Did xanthan gum make me go manic? Confused.... Can anyone relate to this? I was on a really strict diet off dairy gluten not eating anything processed and feeling pretty stable. I was even sleeping well.Then someone brought me a treat these gluten free cookies and chocolate soy milk. I ate the cookies and as time progressed started to feel more unstable. Like unpleasantly stimulated unfocused bloated and I was up all night with insomnia and strange sensations going on in my body. I then read the ingredients on the cookies and it contained xanthan gum and tapioca starch and I decided to be cautious about those ingredients and didn't have any more cookies. I didn't however read the ingredients on the chocolate soy milk which turned out to also have xanthan gum. I kept drinking this for three days and my insomnia became steadily more severe and I started having to rely on sedatives again to sleep. My mood was also elevating and it became harder to focus on anything. I was feeling insanely promiscuous S Then by day four my anxiety and panic skyrocketed. I ended up getting SO desperate feeling hyper social and feeling so needy and vulnerable and afraid that it made me reckless making dangerous plans needing to meet up with any man or else I was convinced I'd die. I NEEDED someone to hold me OR ELSE.... Almost got myself in some trouble and was NOT thinking at all. Thankfully I managed to stay in the house and not act mostly because my family came back early and I could no longer have any strange men from the internet over........Anyway since I stopped drinking that chocolate milk I still have anxiety but am finally feeling a bit... more settled...... I'm back to being my introverted self again and not wanting to socialize at all and am just thankful that nothing really bad happened. I'm just confused about WHY that happened to me. Also during that whole time I was horribly bloated.Can anyone relate to anything like this?I'm confused and feel alone in this. And this isn't something anyone else really understands.If you read the comments here you'll find a lot of people have had puzzling reactions to this ingredient and insomnia is a common responsehttpschriskresser.comharmfulorharmlessxanthangum,Bipolar
46095,Bipolar and Supplements Hey y'all. I'm 28F on Wellbutrin Lamictal and Lithium. I low key suck at drinking water but am getting better at it. My doctor recommended that I start taking B6 I chose a BComplex with high B6 and I added Spearmint and Evening Primrose for the severe cystic acne that comes with Lithium. I also started taking Milk Thistle as recommended by someone who also has Bipolar as it is supposedly good for your liver function.I was just curious if anyone else takes supplements or what your personal experience with any has been. I know since supplements are sort of wishy washy anyway so defnitely not a recommendation but am interested to see what other folks might know for further research. Thanks!,Bipolar
46117,Just diagnosed Hello I was just diagnosed and have been looking back at my life realizing exactly when my episodes really impacted my life. I have had months of extra energy and lofty goals followed by failure when I am unable to continue. Usually the cycle is 36 months at a time it seems. Since being diagnosed I noticed one day where I was manic in a long depressive streak so my question is what is typical for cycles? Can I have a 3 hour manic episode? Is it just rare when im having a long streak? Trying to get a grip since this day was very embarrasing and has caused me so much trouble. Is month cycles more common or just day to day?And I just want to say this fucking sucks. All my time is spent trying to be like I am when I'm manic and now I find out its a bad thing. This was the best part of myself. ,Bipolar
45915,Is happiness and stability truly attainable? I am 24 years old right now. I was diagnosed bipolar type 1 in October 2016 age 23 after a suicide attempt landed me in the hospital so relatively speaking this is a new diagnosis. When I got diagnosed a lot of things about my adolescence suddenly made sense. I suspected as early as age 15 that I was bipolar but was unable to get help for a few years. I have felt depressed since I was probably 9 and I started struggling with sleephaving manic episodes since I was maybe 12 or 13. When I was 21 I got to university and they had a counseling program. This was when medication began.The counselor and doctor just assumed I was depressed and had anxiety so we medicated that which caused further problems. I eventually stopped taking the medicine couldnt afford it and especially not if it was making it worse and things went back to normal. So I guess thats what Im getting at. My normal is fairly stable. If 1 is a major depressive episode 5 is perfectly stable and 10 is a manic episode Im probably at a 3 most of the time. The depression is such a huge part of me that even when Im manic af its only ever a mixed episode.When I was diagnosed bipolar we started medicating for that and sometimes things feel okay for a little bit but Ive gone through several meds and combos and almost everything makes me feel worse. I either end up somewhere on the maniamixed episode spectrum or I feel no different at all. As it is a good cup of coffee makes me feel better than most combos Ive tried so I stopped taking anything and I feel mostly fine. Just the usual 34 that I always am. But what I want to know is if its possible to actually end up happy. Is there a combination of drugs that will make me feel better and I just need to keep trying? Is there something that may be more effective than just drugs? ECT or some kind of therapy? Or will I always live a life of being a little bit depressed. TLDR fairly recently diagnosed BD1 always at least a little depressed. Is happiness in the right combo of meds something else or am I doomed to always be depressed?,Bipolar
46170,I got a new job! My greatest accomplishment was passing the state electrical exam with ADD but with the help of Ritalin. After being laid off from work several times because of being bipolar I went through depression which caused me to want to quit the trade. I have had a divorce from the field and don't want to be an electrician anymore. Hit with child support I found myself without a job for a long time. I worried I was going to jail for non payment and finally found a job at McDonald's making 7.25 an hour at 10 hours a week. Not enough to pay child support. I responded to an ad for a job remodeling firesmokewater damaged houses and aced my interview. I got the call today on the job offer. 11 an hour at 40 hours a week. I went from 200mo to 1760mo. I used to make 4000mo. But I'm happy I can finally pay my bills. Being jobless a felon a divorce and not having filed my taxes since 2012 had me in crippling depression. I've since found a website I could file everything and will be doing that soon so I won't go to federal prison for tax dodging. After years of drug abuse with alcoholism I have also been sober three years. Small victories. ,Bipolar
46367,I no longer see this as an illness I was diagnosed 4 years ago after a psychotic episode. Tried many medications to control the swings including Depakote Lithium Quetiapine and so on. Nothing worked and I started thinking about that. This 'illness' is not understood in any capacity. No one knows why people get it no one knows how medication works or if it will work. The medication is proven to be severely damaging to our bodies and often meds stop working all together but are difficult to stop taking due to withdrawals. I'm not anti med in anyway but I'm anti long term meds. No doubt medication has helped during acute episodes but keeping me on them long term did more damage to my life than good.ampx200BI've been volunteering writing music walking. If I feel depressed I accept that. I lay in bed and cry and that's okay I think. I feel much better saying to myself 'you have extreme moods swings experience them' rather than 'you have extreme mood swings you need to suppress that as well as all your other emotions.'ampx200B I've started looking for alternative ways to bring myself some peace. I have been off medication for two months now and have really enjoyed the lows and highs I've been experiencing. I feel more like myself I don't have the constant sedation. I've stopped thinking 'why do I feel this way' and just experience my emotions without any judgement or thinking that there's something wrong with me. Bipolar can be a gift to experience life in ways others cannot.ampx200BI think being told that bipolar is a bad thing and it's an illness did me so much more harm than if had been told that i'm ok the way I am I just need to learn how to experience it whilst keeping myself safe.,Bipolar

45707,I think I am bipolar and was misdiagnosed with borderline... now what? UK Hello. To cut a very long story short I believe I am bipolar but have been misdiagnosed with borderline personality disorder. My GP says this is likely and that my treatment so far has been inappropriate because the crisis team are dismissive of people with personality disorders. So she has referred me to see the entrylevel people who gauge whether I can see a psychiatrist with a view to be rediagnosed. After that I am worried about what will happen. I desperately want some treatment that will work for me but I've found that BPD is a very sticky label and professionals often treat me like I am playing the system to try and get sympathy and as if what I say is unreliable. I am afraid of the psychiatrist thinking I am just shopping for a new diagnosis. Also I have run into a lot of problems in my health care from being diagnosed BPD does anyone know if I can have that diagnosis removed if it's found to be incorrect?Anyone been through this? It's my first time here so apologies if this post is not allowed I don't think I saw anything in the rules that it violates but I may have misread.Many thanks to anyone who comments.,Bipolar
46286,I failed the IB diploma. I don't want to try anymore. BD1 It's 1229 AM here. I'm so tired of trying. I tried in the IBDP and scored 2445 points and didn't receive my diploma. My attendance was 38 and I was in a psych ward for most of the time I wasn't there. I don't want to repeat senior year because I'm so burnt out I just don't have another senior year in me. I can't go to university because I have no ATAR. I'm applying for a remark but I was three points away from passing my HL subjects so I doubt it'll do much. I can do a diploma at a university and go onto a degree in 2020 but I know it's going to tear me apart seeing my friends doing real degrees. My dream was to study in the US. I got an ACT score of 30. I was going to go there for real! I was so excited and proud of myself when I got that score!Now I want to go back in time and slap that stupid smile off my stupid face. I was never going to make it. I was stupid to think that I could. I have had anorexia nervosa since I was eleven years old. My BMI is around 13. Every time I move my head I can feel my blood pressure doing some weird shit. I've had disordered tendencies since I was six. I do not remember a time when I was at peace with myself. I don't think I'll ever get better. I've tried so many times to heal. I'm on meds. I don't want to give up hope. There's a small part of me that wants to keep going. I really do want to be able to do a degree someday move out of home maybe even find love. God I'm so lonely. I have friends sure. But I want to experience love. It seems like it's useless to pursue that 90 of relationships involving an individual with bipolar end in divorce. I imagine that this is higher for those with BD1. But I have so much love to give. I was in a relationship until a few weeks ago but she was emotionally abusive. I can never get better and find love because my body is disgusting. I'm very short 5'6 and female. I'm the shortest in my family by four inches. I'm around 36 kilograms and I only look normal. I once weight restored to the still unhealthy for my height 46kg and I was hideous. I looked overweight. I can never get better from my ED if I ever want anyone to love me. I don't know. Just a little rant. I'm tired of trying to get better when it seems like there is no hope for me. Just this past week I had 7 straight days of eating over 2000 calories. This was a big deal for me. I really thought I could get better. But today I freaked out and ate nothing because I saw how fat I had gotten in only one week. I need advice. What do I even do? My new psychiatrist doesn't think I'm sick enough to see me more than once every three weeks. My old one went to jail but he cared and he saw me once a week. He went under for getting caught cooking morphine but he was always lovely to me and genuinely cared. This one doesn't really think I'm sick enough to be seen more often. Although if I ask I will probably be able to go inpatient in the private hospital she works at. A friend of mine also BD1 went IP there and found it very helpful but he's much older than me and I don't know what it was like in his ward as I was down the hall in the eating disorder program. Which I was kicked out of after four days had panic attack and lit a cigarette in my room.So. What should I do about treatment? I have the option to go for BD or my anorexia but I don't do well with other anorexics around as they trigger me. I also have all the group thought experimentsexercisesnot sure how to call them from the eating disorder unit as I got friends who've stayed there to send them to me. In theory I could complete them in my own time if I were to go for BD and stay in that ward instead of the eating disorder ward. However I do think that some of the things I didn't experience during my time in that ward takeaway nights eating in public challenges etc may have really helped me. So I'm fairly certain I will go inpatient but not sure which ward to go to. Also what should I do about my education? Should I just try to get over myself and do a diploma here then review my options for university be that domestic or abroad when that's finished or wait and see what happens with the remark or resit my exams? This got long I'm sorry. I skipped meds yesterday morning and last night. But I just really need some help. I'm so tired.,Bipolar

46462,Recently diagnosed BP on meds still feeling hypersexual sometimes. I was diagnosed about 9 months ago and have been in meds that have been working and keeping me on even keel. They did take a while to get accustomed to but I'd say I've been steady for 5 months. I am not nearly as hypersexual as I was or engaged in risky behavior blowing a cop on the side of the road who had stopped me for speeding??? but I still find that some days I'll start masturbating and end up spending a good part of the day doing it. It hasn't happened often but it happens enough to make me worry. Even then I didn't start doing that until a couple months ago. I didn't know if I was just getting used to my meds or what.

But I don't really know the difference between one and two or what bipolar really is. I was always diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I thought that I had depersonalization along with it and it was just not an issue to the psychiatrist.I guess my questions are what is bipolar disorder?

45984,Advice The Dead Sea saltiest place on Earth second to her. New Relationship and best described as dating a pretzel... Twisted salty and I can't get enough! I'm a 22 yo Maori male and have been seeing this choice as lady for a coupley months she's 30 and deals with type 1. We just started living together and she has 2 awesome young girls who also seem to posses the ability of growing horns on command. I don't know how to explain that I enjoy playing with fire aware of getting burned. The unpredictable is such a turn on from good vibes present to more energy than a lightning storm. I haven't known her personally for long but majority of her previous relationships with family and partners has been a path of hardship through physical mental and spiritual violence... Due to their lack of understandingempathy. I'm fortunate to have personal stability and have so much stength to support this beautiful lady plenty of time for her daughters as want to provide them with the guidance and opportunities that I took for granted in whatever they wish to pursue. It's still early days and she's a really independent lady a survivor not a victim so there aren't labels yet as such as she struggles with romantic feelings as much as guys. She doesn't take meds but from previous experience they bring about a numbness. I strongly identify with spiritnatrual alternatives as a Maori not just crazy if anyone has any suggestions? At times she goes really queit and you can feel the static in the room I just haven't grasped how to bring her out of this headspace as she is so independent and hasn't had a partner that can support and just listen without anger or wanting to fix everything she keeps quiet. Her thought manifests in the environment and is like static electricity. she seems to resolve issues like a male through self reflection rather than a verbal release. Laughter seems to help so I try change her pattern of thought with humour but the downside being i dont know what's appropriate at times. Last thing I want is to come across as her mother especially since early days but I'm all about the family values and just here for support. To listen rather than reply these ears aren't painted on. If anyone has any advise on this situation dealing with my lady who could make even the devil breakdown on Jeremy Kyle. Would be much appreciated. She's so worth it without darkness we'd never appreciate how good the light is. Nothing worse than a basic btch like a challenge.,Bipolar
45601,Acceptance...for now. I've been on disability for a good while now. Anyone on disability can probably relate to the strong desire to be away from it. The Social Security office generally treats you like a criminal you never know who agrees with the negative stigma and sees you as some sort of lazy leach on society and some days you fight with the notion yourself. Many people tie worth to one's ability to work and contribute and it's easy to fall into that realm of thought where you feel worthless and ashamed. Anyway to my story. Around June last year I was put on a gamechanging medication. My anxiety disappeared seemingly overnight and I felt more confident and comfortable than I have for most of my life. Gears started turning in my head. I could go out among the people! Maybe I could find some companionship and stop feeling so lonely. Maybe I could earn my keep and feel some pride for a change.This lead to me starting a second parttime job with the intention of ramping up my hours carefully and slowly the goal being to eventually be making enough to support myself without the SSDI check Medicare etc. I was certain I was on track to being an honest normal person. I took on more and more responsibilities. Things were looking good for about 6 months.Then the medication turned on me as it seems they all eventually do. Every day things get worse. While it still keeps the majority of my anxiety at bay I now have a persistent depression. I've lost interest in many things including wanting to do a good job at work. I let things slip do the bare minimum and count each second until I am able to go home. Increasing hours at a job that I am having less and less of a tolerance for seems like a good way to speed up an inevitable crash and burn. If something doesn't change soon I will likely have a breakdown andor wind up in the hospital.And for what?Before I started the new med and took the second parttime job I was doing okay for myself. My first part time job was enough to keep me connected to the outside world even though the pay might have been considered token at best. I kept myself busy with personal projects. At times I felt lonely but I had friends. I had trouble with anxiety and depression but I had time and space to cope. In my current situation I feel like I'm on a speeding train. There are no timeouts when I am feeling terrible. What time I have for my own interests is tainted by dread of the next workday and this consistent low current of depression. The second parttime job has made the first one the one I found rewarding and enjoyable feel like an inescapable chore. All I want to do now is go home and hide. All this effort put in to build a respectable life and dig myself out from under disability and I feel so much more frightened fragile and trapped than before. No medication has been effective for me for such a long duration. I was certain it was the one so I ended up biting off more than I could chew. Now I'm dependent on a drug that makes me miserable and puts me in a precarious emotional state every day. I stress out and hide from my responsibilities. Every day I feel inadequate and not up to snuff. And why? Because I felt guilty for being on disability? Because I was certain that life free off it would be better? That I couldn't have companionship selfworth or be among the living if I wasn't earning my keep in traditional terms?After much thought I have made a conscious choice to regress. Clearly working full time is not an attainable goal for me right now. I'm cutting my current average of 15 hours per week at my second job to around 7. Between it and my first job I'm likely looking at around 10 a week which I think will be manageable. Also I'm getting off the wonder drug that keeps my anxiety at bay at the cost of my sanity and happiness. I will regroup stabilize and find some damned peace.Being off disability wasn't in the cards this time and that's okay. There's a reason I was put on it in the first place. Maybe I will find an opportunity to be financially independent in the future maybe not. But I will stop with the selfshaming. I can still have a worthwhile life whatever the circumstances. TLDR I found a wonder drug thought it would finally get me off disability. It didn't and that's okay. Life goes on.EDIT Added TLDR and fixed some grammar.,Bipolar
46104,Those of you who experience auditory hallucinations what coping mechanisms do you use? I have Bipolar with psychotic features. This displays as auditory hallucinations and delusional thoughts. Sometimes playing white noise will help with the hallucinations since they're mostly quiet whispers or something like hearing a radio in another room. They've been louder than usual here lately and the white noise isn't helping as much. Do you all have any suggestions for a situation like that? Thanks.,Bipolar
46005,Can i be bipolar For 3 years i have been struggling with depression and anger. 2018 has been hell. I have lost 2 friends this year and January my parents divorced and my mother whomst i was very close to moved out of the country leaving me with my asshole dad who doesn't love me.I have periods where i am low all of the time. These periods i have this constant feeling of sadness and selfhate. Last year i had a suicide attempt.A few months pass and i am suddenly very angry. I want to kill everyone and everything. I have been arrested a few times for violence.Then i have a week where i feel superior. Noone is as good as i am. I am a legend and everyone else are inferior.Disclaimer i am norwegian and my english isn't all that great,Bipolar
46293,Intense bursts of anxiety and stress I did a little bit of research prior to this but I couldn't find anything specific enough to my situation.Does anyone here get these intense bursts of like anxiety agitation and stress seemingly from out of nowhere?I always need to step away when I feel this way just to clear my head and it's over the most trivial things often a sudden change of plans or having to multitask e.g. being part of a conversation while getting texts I need to reply to.It completely overwhelms me to the point where I can't think straight. I get really snappy and rude and I feel terrible about it cause I can't control it and it affects the people around me. It's a very confusing feeling but it fades again after maybe 1020 minutes of clearing my head. That's also around the time where embarrassment kicks in and I start apologising for being so cold and rude.Can anyone relate? How do you handle it and maybe prevent it from overwhelming you?,Bipolar
45532,Bad inpatient stories? Ive been hospitalized twice as a teenager in a youth ward and twice as an adult. The last time was at Fairfax Behavioral Hospital in Kirkland WA and it was abusive as hell. Everything about why I was there was horribly exaggerated and they lied about me when I went to court so I got legally committed to two weeks unless a doctor signed me out. They literally said because I took so long with the strip search because Ive been raped quite a few times but you know they didnt mention that part that I couldnt handle interacting with anyone right now and I was still obviously in an extreme crisis and I might injure someone else. I wasnt even in an episode lmao I was fine after two days of being there and Ive never been a violent person? But go off I guess. A lot of other shitty things happened and they got my hopes up and said I could leave one day but then they were like nah youre gonna stay for another few days for no reason I told them its illegal to hold me when Im not in a crisis and they were like haha ok try to leave then. When it was my day to leave my case worker lost necessary paperwork and then went on a two hour lunch and my psychiatrist didnt have time to write my prescriptions. I ended up leaving the facility at 7pm when my exit time was 230pm.Not trying to bring up bad memories but Im curious to know if its more common to have extremely negative experiences rather than positive ones.So does anyone have any super shitty inpatient experiences?Also where is the facility located?

Right now ive been doing great for about 3 weeks and I'm worried I'm actually hypo and to be honest the only thing missing is productivity. Instead of working on coursework or assignments like I usually do when hypo I've just been playing video games and partying. I've had loads of energy not much of an appetite some confusion a bit impulsive far more sociable than usual. Idk validate me Bois or tell me I'm overreacting.

46127,Advice for me diagnosed with depression questioning bipolar This is something I just dont know how to address.I have depression and anxiety diagnosed 2 years ago but Ive been aware of it for much longer. I was given 3 medications for my panic attacks and depression by my colleges psychiatrist but upon her retiring the college wellness center notified me that a nurse practitioner would be monitoring my medication from them on. I felt unsafe angry and wiped from the medication so I stopped taking it. I quit going to appointments and eventually they billed me for all of my noshows and never followed up.For months after I went off my meds I experienced suicidal thoughts extreme depressive thoughts and began self harming. This was very out of character for me. But I stayed off my mess out of fear of regressing. I somewhat leveled out.I have a family history of bipolar disorder and Im getting close to graduating. Ive been feeling very much unlike myself lately and Im and my boyfriend is noticing rapid mood changed from manic cleaning the ENTIRE house instigating fights eating constantly which Im not sure is exactly manic but I cant regulate it and rapid thoughts to depressive laying in bed and threatening to never get out crying before every shift at work because Im just so tired feeling like Im making no progress and just feeling small. My boyfriend has told me at times he feels inequipped talking me through these episodes. Hes expressed that I should consider going to therapy again.Im graduating in December and I just feel like potentially being diagnosed with something else or being recommended new medication can ruin that. Ive worked so hard to get here and I want my degree. But I feel as though its irresponsible to put off taking care of my mental health.Im also pretty poor so therapy would be tough for me to pay for. I do have insurance though so I dont know how much of a difference that could make. Ive only ever received free therapy. Does anyone have recommendations? Is it worth pursuing a diagnosis for soundness of mind or is it possible for me to just recognize that in myself and adapt? I limit alcohol intake as that typically makes things worse for me. But Im afraid of taking medication because Im so forgetful and anxious about actually going to refill my prescription.I apologize for the word vomit but I just dont know where to go from here.,Bipolar

45568,Death of Seasons selfhatred spoiler I was listening to one of my favorite songs from grade school and I realized that it fits perfectly in describing how I feel towards depression my will to survive depression and the angst remorse and grief of falling into a depression. Here is the song . . . ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspOf late it's harder just to go outside ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp To leave this deadspace with hatred so alive ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp Writhing with sickness thrown into banality I decay ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp Killed by the weakness but forced to return turn it off ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspI watch the stars as they fall from the sky ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspI held a fallen star and it wept for me dying ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspI feel the fallen stars encircle me now as they cry ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspOut there so quickly grows malignant tribes ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspPosthuman extinction excels unrecognized ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspFeeling surrounded so bored with mortality I decay ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp All of this hatred is fucking real turn it on... yeah ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspIt won't be all right despite what they say ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspJust watch the stars tonight as they as they disappear disintegrate ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspAnd I disintegrate 'cause this hate is fucking real ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspAnd I hope to shade the world as stars go out and I disintegrate The first stanza starts the process of slipping into depression. Its hard to leave the walls that are now built around you the hatred drawn inwards is real and deadly. Leaving is an escape but the mind of depression forces you to return inwards retreat back home and continue the stages of decay even violence Killed by the weaknessturn it offThe second stanza is how I see this process of suffering being reflected in the natural world through the observation of stars. I am reminded of the title of the song Death of Seasons which is organic and relates to nature. There is compassion inherent in seeing the suffering of them I held a fallen star and it wept for me The fallen stars encircle me is an act of compassion by nature itself reminding me that the feelings of depression and disconnection are universal.The third stanza is also about the outside world but a reflection on society and other people which is viewed as working a brutal and threatening agenda malignant tribes. For me viewing the world at large in this way begins to give birth to thoughts that lead me to believe that the world is cruel and that I no longer wish to participate in it which completes the process of depression and fatefully gives rise to the momentum of wanting to take my own life.The bridge or last stanza is a confirmation of the reality of depression merely the way things are so to speak. The vocalist directs the attention to the sky and sees the completion of the cycle the end of the season when things wither and die. Yet compassion for the whole world is alive I hope to shade the world as stars go out which still amazes me that in the throes and thick of a hard depression the parts of me that want to help and be a part of the world live on.,Bipolar

My parents are away so only my maid was there and I still managed to tell her weird secrets and proceeded to show her all my dumb drawings of my imaginary boyfriend as well as showing her all the shows not really a show but a game that has many stories that I watch and pointing out which guy Im in love with. I have no clue why I done this! I feel deeply ashamed for doing this and revealing personal secrets. I also yelled at my grandma she did deserve it but I should have just hanged up the call complained about my mum and stepdad to my maid grandpa grandma and biological father. I also went and bought lots of random cooking stuff and makeup that doesnt suit me so now I have to return it. And I bought 3 bags of cereal. I am not even allowed cereal by mum. No clue why I bought it. So yeah...P.S. For any people who are going to be like go get a diagnosis and meds and this wont happen I dont want to right now. I have nothing to gain from just getting diagnosed and while I do want meds one day I will wait until I have kids because I dont want to take pills when Im pregnant and apparently withdrawal symptoms are horrible. Also Im scared of the side effect of gaining weight.Whats the weirdestmost embarrassingmost regrettable thing you did when hypomanic?

46086,Creativity is more fleeting than it used to be? I amwas a very creative person I went to an Arts high school and ya da ya da. I created art in cycles I could be very prolific in painting poetry music... etc. It didnt always have to be a manic episode. Now that I received this official diagnosis in early university and have been put through the ringer of meds its just not what it used to be. The lithium and the antipsychotics really mellow me out and I notice that when the prescription for an antipsychotic increases my creativity decreases. That said Im no longer on antipsychs but my creativity hasnt returned... am I just getting older? or are the medications that make my mood more stable taking this part of my personality away from me? TLDR now that im on meds im less creative is it me or is it the meds? ,Bipolar
45746,i kind of want to go off my meds i want a reset. i want to be my true self and not have these pills change my brain. i miss the fun parts of mania and i truly miss not knowing what's going on half the time.before meds i was either too manic to feel any worry or realize what's happening or i was too depressed to plan on living much longer. either way responsibility was never on my mind. neither was my job or money or food or anything real adults have to deal with. i was completely unaware of how life really is and i want that back!i'm feeling super restless right now and it's coming out of nowhere. i don't know if i've ever wanted to go off my meds before? i honestly can't remember. i don't know why i'm feeling this way because i know without my meds i'm a literal mess and i'm reckless and destructive and irresponsible and overall a huge danger to myself in many ways. but i'm so tired of reality right now i just want it to end. if i can't go into an alternate world maybe letting my mind become an alternate world again is the next best thing? does anyone else ever get tired of living in reality?i've been on meds for 7 years and i'm still not used to the stress of responsibilities and real life on medication. ,Bipolar

Didnt get better meds just kinda made everything worse they only took away my hallucinations and made me sleep. After being on crisis for like 2 years straight which includes several suicide attempts and going to the hospital several times while having a daughter and being married..yeah it was shit.

46304,About to start day program. I'd like some advice So I'm going to this clinic about 500 miles away from home. I picked this one because my dad went there and made tremendous improvements in his mental health. Seriously night and day. I'm blessed to have the opportunity to go but I am nervous as fuck.First of all I have some substance abuse issues but I'm afraid to bring them up because I'm afraid they won't treat me for my bipolar just for my addiction. I think they go hand in hand but if I could get some help managing my bipolar I think my problems with substances would start to fix itself. I could be wrong. Will they refuse to treat me if I fail their drug test?This clinic has a heavy Christian influence. One of their main goals with the program is to rekindle your relationship with God. I don't feel great about this because religion use to play a big part of my paranoia and worries. I've separated myself from organized religion over the last few years and that has helped. However I'm afraid all the preaching will rekindle my fears and anxeity over the issue.Finally I'm nervous because I feel like this is my last chance to get better. I've done quite a few programs and this is kind of a drastic step. For me to go it's expensive and time consuming and is going to put my girlfriend and step kids in hard spot. I feel terrible I even have to go but if it doesn't work I can't imagine how I'll feel. I'll have wasted everyone's time and put the people I love most through it too.,Bipolar

I wouldn't even call myself human because I'm so monstrous I feel I don't resemble one. It should be considered a crime for me to expose my appearance to other people. No one deserves to look at such a disgusting thing. I don't deserve to be alive.Those thoughts are always in the back of my head. Sometimes I'll look at myself and feel confused because I don't understand how I could feel like that. I look normal. Even pretty sometimes. And other times I'll look at myself and cry and scream and vomit because of how hideous I am. I don't understand why I have to hate myself so much. How can my feelings change so much? How can I be okay with who I am one moment and want to die because of how I look the next? I can't even trust my eyes to know how I look. I don't know if I'm pretty and I don't know if I'm hideous. And I can't ask anyone because I know every answer other than you're disgusting will make me think they're lying to make me feel better.When I see someone look at me I know they're thinking of me. Thinking how can a human look this grotesque. Despising me. Hating me because my existence forced them to look at me. I don't ever want to go outside because I know I'm being looked at and being watched and being hated.I'm so tired. I've been in therapy since I was 6 because of things like this. 13 years of therapy hasn't helped one bit. In fact I hate myself even more. Because wouldn't constant lessons change my mind a bit if I was actually wrong? So I must be right. I haven't been to a doctor since October but I have made an appointment for next month. I don't know if I can last that long. I've covered up all the mirrors and windows in my house and I've covered the cameras on my phone and computer. There are 3 people I can stand looking at me. I have to leave the house next Sunday and the Sunday after that. How can I do that when I'll be subjecting everyone around me to look at a monster?I'm so tired of this,Bipolar

I'm just missing him and maybe his words can bring comfort to anyone going through a tough time.There once was a guy who was tired all the time and sometimes he let the weight of the world wear him down so much he had a hard time remembering how much he loved the most simplest and best things there were like the joy I feel when I think about Megan Elizabeth.I wish sometimes when I was the most dead man walkingest I would just think of how much I love you and how happy I can feel just because you're my daughter.I love you forever and more than that.And that's the truth.So all of you struggling I know it's fucking hard.

45880,Substituting Geodon for Indica Strains Hello I am currently on 125mg Lamictal when i wake up then 40mg Geodon before bed. I have gone from 240lbs lithium as mood stabilizer to instead 215lbs on lamictal mood stabilizer. So in trying to get back to the weight I was before medication 180lbs I will experiment if Indica Cannibis can produce similar or better sleep effects as Geodon. If anyone has tried or is in a state where they can try please comment.My guess is a couple hits off a indica was vape pen and a small edible and you will be counting sheep within an hour. Keep in mind I will be continuing on the Lamictal mood stabilizer studied to cause weight loss and only seek to eliminatelessen my dosage of Geodon said to have low risk of weight gain which for me is 45 pounds. Thanks for readingAlso I have tried up too 200 mg of CBD oil which was advertised as a alternative for anti psychotics with no success. When i took them in place of the Geodon I would only nap for a few hours in what felt like a shallow half awake sleep. I would not recommend spending 80 dollars on a 30 30mg capsules from Wildflower CBD.com which was recommended by high times so i assume it is legit they simply do not help you stay asleep. I would try the indica strain canabis for myself but live in a state that is dragging their heels with there medical Marijuana program. ,Bipolar

46346,Not sure if I want kids because of this I was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2 and I'm still not totally sure what that means. I have really bad months followed by a few weeks where I do really well and I'm really happy followed by a few more bad months of depression and anxiety. When I met my wife four years ago I didn't know I'd get this bad. I had a history of depression and anxiety disorder but I was keeping it controlled without medication. Two years ago I had a breakdown and had to go back into therapy which led to now. My wife and I always talked about having kids but the worse I feel the less I feel like I'd make a good dad. I barely feel like getting up to go to work let alone do all the chores that are already piled up around the house. I can't imagine putting a kid on top of all that. Not to mention I'd hate to bring someone else into the world and they feel as bad as I do. It seems selfish of me to have a kid on a whim and then end up being a shitty dad. I don't know how to tell my wife. I love her she makes me so happy but I don't know if I can do this. She's not pregnant but she's off the pill and we've decided to take a loose take on trying. We already don't have a lot of sex. Am I right about this or is this just my chemically off balanced brain making itself feel worse? Am I the only one who thinks like this?,Bipolar
46391,Will You Take Medications For The Rest of Your Life? Its been 2 years since I was hospitalized for a manicpsychotic episode where I was diagnosed with bipolar. Over the course of 5 months posthospitalization I tried a myriad of medical concoctions including lithium abilify latuda and many others whose name Ive since forgotten. Whether due to the depressive episode that came directly after my manic one or the terrible side effects I decided I would go off medications.So now its been 19 months since Ive taken any medications. Ive avoided drugs alcohol and other stressors. I make sure to sleep 810 hours a day eat healthy drink lots of water workout meditate etc. and it seems like Ive been stable. I still get occasional periods of depression which I easily ride out or bursts of hypomania which makes life easier however all delusionsserious effects have all but disappeared.I recognize however that can be an illusion and at any point things can spin outside of my control. So recently I got a pdoc to write a prescription for Latuda however I havent picked up the medication yet because Im starting to question whether I should get back on it.This is primarily because I feel like the effects of longterm medication use can have irreversible consequences on the brain. It doesnt help that we have had 0 longitudinal studies showing the effects of staying on these medications for 20 years if there are I'd love to see them!. So given that Im currently stable I am having a hard time convincing myself to start taking medications indefinitely. I understand some people cannot function without their medication however Im lucky to not be part of that cohort for now.Anyways Im not advocating that anyone stop taking medications but I am curious how others view this topic do you intend on sticking with medications for the rest of your life?,Bipolar

46357,PSA Steroids And Worsening Of Bipolar Symptoms Disclaimer I am not a doctor so please always consult with yours when you seek medical treatment.I don't see this talked about enough. It's flu season and many of us may become sick and be prescribed steroids. Steroids have the chance of worsening bipolar symptoms and may send you into a mixed episode or manic episode or worse. If you are prescribed steroids please mention your bipolar diagnosis with your doctor. I'm sure there are cases of bipolar people that have taken steroids and have come out fine afterwards. I'm sure there are cases where a bipolar person is required to take steroids as there are infinite personally specific medical conditions and situations. But ask yourself these questions Have you disclosed your bipolar disorder to the practitioners prescribing steroids? Are you stable? Are you medicated? Do you have the resources to get emergency help should things go wrong? I was sick last year and prednisone almost made me kill myself. I had no idea that steroids could make my bipolar disorder worse. I spent over a week in hell as it left my system. Apparently it even awakens bipolar disorder in otherwise stable bipolars. If anyone has any evidence to the contrary or input or experience please post.

45594,My cat just died.... She wasnt even a full year old yet. Around 2am tonight I realized I hadnt seen her since the morning so I looked for her. Finally found her under my bed. She wasnt waking up when I called her and when I reached out to her she was rock hard and cold. I had to pull her stiff body out to the middle of my bedroom floor and absolutely fucking lost it. Shed probably been dead since midday. Picking her up and walking her to my car and from my car into the pet hospital sent me even more over the edge. I couldnt handle it. I dont know what to do. Neither I nor the technicians know what happened. I dont know what to fucking do. She was my medicine. She was my fucking cure for this stupid fucking disease and made me feel like maybe I had a purpose and she was the one thing who made me feel loved. Gave me the purest and most wholesomely full heart. I havent felt love like that...maybe ever. I felt a little less fucking lonely in this endless depression because I had someone who would sleep with me and be close to me and make me feel loved. And she fucking died. I cant handle this. I have no one to hug me and no one to hold me right now because my closest friend is on a ship in the middle of the fucking ocean for who knows how much longer. I just. really? really. This has to be a joke. Im fucking done. Im so fucking over this life and feeling cold and alone and not being able to hold onto any kind of fucking love I get. I keep thinking that this is karma for just being a shit person inside. I hate myself. I hate this. I just want to love and feel fucking loved. and now. she died.,Bipolar

Im going through a separationdivorce and Ive been having a manic episode for about a week. Cant sleep more than three hours a night and Ive lost about 6lbs. Cant seem to come out of it no matter what I do. I did stop taking all psych meds about 6 months ago before this all happened aside from the occasional xanax and switched to thc edibles for sleep at night. It was working pretty well for me until this all happened. Is there anything in particular that you could recommend for stopping mania? Im fucking desperate. ,Bipolar
46070,Actually losing my mind new meds Trigger Warning Talk of suicide. Sorry I can't edit the title. Bipolar II here with several anxiety disorders and PPDPPA for funzies. I've been actively suicidal but not attempting and somewhat paranoid lately. The only reason I don't kill myself is because of my 10monthold son and a volunteer project I don't want to leave unfinished. I should add that I am traditionally very high functioning successful career marriage healthy baby but life circumstances have taken a flamethrower to my world and burned it down to ashes as of late. On a scale of 110 my level of stress is at a 13.I came into my psychiatrist's office sobbing Tuesday morning. I didn't tell her everything but I told her as much as I could without her being legally obligated to commit me. My doctor doubled my Lamictal dose added Seroquel for sleep because I was worried about developing a physical dependency on Klonopin and added Gabapentin as a spot treatment for anxiety. Last night I took the Seroquel as directed. I woke up this morning and my first thoughts upon waking were that I wanted to kill myself and that I was half hoping that my baby had died in his sleep in some way that wasn't my fault so that I could be free of the responsibility of being a mother. I'm sure if I walked into his room and he was actually dead I would lose my goddamn fucking mind. It would be the literal end of me. I have really intense OCD about his safety and intense fears around him dying as a younger infant used to keep me from sleeping. So that was a super strange and disturbing mismatch of thoughts.With that great start to the day I quickly downed the double dose of Lamictal as directed and tried to get on with things. I walked back in the kitchen to my breakfast and half of it was gone and I had no recollection of eating it. I walked around the house for awhile wondering if I had put the pastry down for a minute and forgotten about it. Nope. I did not find the pastry in another room. Almost the exact same thing happened yesterday with a donut. I ate half of a donut on the way to the doctor's office. I thought I had a whole second donut in my bag. When I looked in my bag after the appointment there was only half of a donut left. I thought maybe a homeless person in the grocery store ate half of it and put it back in the pastry case and I didn't notice when I purchased it it was a sketchy grocery store it could happen though unlikely. I told myself that was insane and that surely I ate half of the second donut and forgot about it. I tried to tell myself I was being nuts and eat the rest of the damn donut but I ended up spitting it out because I pictured another person's mouth on it. Can stress really cause memory problems like this or am I straight up losing it? Why the fuck do I keep having memory problems only around my breakfast? I am not eating very much at all so maybe it's first thing in the morning blood sugar thing.Around noon with the new drugs in my system instead of wanting to kill myself I just don't see the point of anything. I had a job interview today that went fine. But all professional jobs just seem stupid to me all of a sudden like we are all working on gibberish and acting like it matters. Who the hell cares if we make a new brochure and more people buy a product? I feel like a 15yearold who just watched Fight Club for the first time and realized capitalism is meaningless. I had some other projects I was working on and I just don't understand the point now. Why would I spend time refinishing a dresser? Seriously why? I can't think of anything more stupid.I also had the thought this morning that I feel like I'm on life support but instead of a breathing machine it's a bunch of pills.Right now I'm thinking about leaving everything right where it is telling my husband he needs to pickup the kid from daycare tonight and just bailing and going to another country until my money runs out. That would fuck up my life and relationships irreversibly. So I might as well kill myself if I'm going that route. Or not. No idea. I guess I wanted to write because I would never ever admit this stuff in real life because it makes me sound like a horrible person who hates my baby and I would never tell another living soul how bad off I really am. can Seroquel make me even more insane? Because that's how I feel. I'm thinking maybe I should just up the Lamictal and see what that does before proceeding with the onslaught of new drugs.Edited to add I am following doctor's orders on the meds. My doctor suggested adding new ones and upping the existing one. I just worry that they are going to make things worse while we sort out the cocktail and I may not have the capacity for things to get worse right now.,Bipolar

45502,I can't decide about school... The second semester just started and idk what to do... I haven't been to school since before Christmas and right now my goals are to take a shower every week and get through the day. I was gone for some time last semester as well and will probably not get a grade in a few classes. This week I met with my school counselor main teacher and my psychologist about school. I'm currently being evaluated for bipolar but it seems pretty clear that I'm going to be put on some medication at least which is kind of terrifying. Though it will be some time until then. So my options are to either take the rest of the school year off and start this autumn redoing my school year or take 3 classes now and the rest next year. Everyone excepts me to have an answer but I don't. I can't even answer simple questions like What do you want to eat?. I wish somebody would just tell me even though I know I have to decide myself. I just can't seem to care. I could barely speak and focus throughout the meeting and my mom ended up speaking mostly. The psychologist brought up shortly how I was last time we talked and I felt shameful for how I had acted. I talked with my brother about how things have been lately and he could kind of relate to my ups only it's from his experiences with drugs. I didn't think it was that bad and it seems he thought he was experiencing a milder version of what I was experiencing. That hit me. Right now it's like I'm taking a look into myself looking at things that seem new to me and all of this is overwhelming and having to evaluate myself is freaky. Idk if school thrown into the mix will help and now my whole class knows I struggle mentally in Norway we have a main class that take certain subjects together. I've also been oversharing with some people and I feel like everyone is looking at me differently. I feel like a disease and a pushover. I'm making everything worse and being distant to everyone but I can't help it. Mom deserves better than me. Though it would maybe be better to take 3 classes now instead of everything next year. The thing is that I haven't been able to concentrate at all. Up or down. When I was up there was just too much noise in my head and I had too many other plans. I couldn't even concentrate on what I wanted to do and kept jumping between a lot of things. Still I was 100 sure I could catch up to everything in a couple days which didn't happen. I ended up not sleeping making a workout schedule that was ridiculous especially for someone who doesn't excercise drinking a lot of Bailey's to calm down didn't work even though I rarely drink then jogging and working out. Then turning really suicidal and lashing out for 23 days before becoming numb. I hate that I want to live yet die so badly at the same time. But. This wasn't what I was going to talk about. I was talking about school.This turned out more like a rant than I would like but it feels better to let it out I guess. Took an hour to write this. Time moves so differently.,Bipolar

45596,Dad needs help with son's bipolar 2 My 18 year old son was diagnosed a few weeks ago with bipolar 2 with psychotic features. Prior to this he was being treated for anxiety with zoloft. About a year ago he started smoking pot to help with the anxiety and convinced me that it was better for him than zoloft. As of last October he started zoloft AND weed. Since then he's had deep depression and some scary rages.He agreed to go see a psychiatrist and that's when he got the diagnosis. The doctor prescribed Latuda but he complained about extra anxiety then when the dose went up to 40mg he had a severe reaction of akathisia and panic attack. So he stopped taking it and we have an appointment in a few days with the pdoc.He keeps insisting that we find a drug with no side effects or he goes back to smoking. He thinks the doctor is stupid and isn't worried about how THC might make paranoia worse.I don't think he knows just how irritable he is almost all the time. I walk on tiptoes worrying that something I say will trigger a 2 hour lecture. Looking at other med options it seems Seroquel might be better since it helps with anxiety but he looked at the side effect list and balked. How do I convince him to keep trying until he finds something that works for him? This seems like a catch 22 he thinks he's smarter than the pdoc but that belief would go away on the right med. I love my son! I want him to feel normal. But nothing in my life has prepared me for how to handle this.,Bipolar

We spent six days in NICU then 2 weeks later we were in the hospital with RSV respiratory syncytial virus for two weeks. Im diagnose cyclothymic and have been for a year and a month after being misdiagnosed major depressive the year before. Im on Lexapro and Lamictal and have been since January 2017 and Im still struggling with a lot of rapid cycling and mental trauma from past experiences...now we have to add my daughter almost dying in my arms from not being able to breathe.Now that thats out of the way I need advice. I cant get back to my therapist until April and I cant change medications because Im breastfeeding. I had high anxiety during pregnancy and the anxiety has lingered along with deepening depressive episodes partially due to loneliness and postpartum. Im in school online for digital media design and Im trying to get a job working at home. My husband works as a teacher at a school 35 minutes away so we dont see him until later in the evenings.Anybody have any ideas for how to manage the depression and cycling until April?

45743,Unsure if I'm bipolarborderlineneither... I know no one can make a diagnosis except a doctor but I was just wondering what others experiences are. I have been on mood stabilizers for about 2 months now. They have really seemed to help me and I have been practicing meditationDBTmindfulnesswhich goes along with the DBT.I was diagnosed as bipolar in December when I was baker acted in late November because I was contemplating suicide. Okay I've been missing my medications and I've been contemplating going out and doing drugs and having sex I'm also extremely irritable and I just want to push people out of my life. I can't stop thinking about these two guys I have a crush on and I almost want them to stop talking to me by messaging them to delete me from their phones off their messaging apps etc. I've done this kind of stuff all my life well since I was a teenager I'm 25 now... I'd just randomly push people awaymostly guys I'd have a crush on... It's like I was upset with myself for thinking about them so much and I figured the only way to make it stop was to push them away but I'd almost regret it afterwards. When it came to female friends I'd just disappear on them for months at a time. Also I'd have impulse control issues during these phases but it would only come on randomly like spending money overeating sex drugs drinking etc. It's weird because in daily life most people would never guess I have these issues since I'm really nice and I try to keep these problems to myself and my mom and my therapist. Right now though I'm feeling all the urges associated with my manic episodes and I'm not sure what to do. I started taking my medicine tonight so I'm hoping it will help. I'm on Lamictal and Trileptal if anyone is interested... Does this sound familiar to anyone else? I know all experiences are different but I've asked other friends and family members before if they ever have these type of experiences and they just look at me like I'm crazy. ,Bipolar
46312,New job schedule is triggering my hypomania I have a parttime job on some days where I usually work from 59 pm and get home at 10 to go to sleep. But I just started a new fulltime 8 am 4 pm job MF. Because of the distance I have to be at the bus stop around 7 am. I know this is risky but I really could use the money. My family was bad with money so I have security issues about not having enough cash in the bank.The first few days were a little rough because my body wasn't used to the schedule change. Getting out of bed was a struggle. But after a few days of that I woke up with the most sublime energy the kind that begs to be released and shown to the world. My first thought was Fuck yeah I'm all better now! My thought process is still accelerating to generate all these new ideas. One day I'm going to write essays on my leftist theories on the occult don't worry they make sense to me for some kind of publication and get famous. But I don't have the patience to sit down and read any relevant literature I just can't go fast enough and I want to throw the book across the room. I've also started another goal to lose weight because I realized I don't need as much fuel to stay energetic as I thought I did. I think the moment I realized I was hypomanic was the hypersexuality the symptom I'm most ashamed of as I'm usually a very disciplined and selfcontrolled person. I think the major reason why I didn't end up acting on those impulses later that night I had the night off was that my back was in a lot of pain and I had to be still ugh the rest of the night.

45864,A tiered approach to medication Lately Ive read a lot about medications people are being prescribed and their feelings towards them and I want to share my feelings on this. I am not a doctor. Bipolar patients need mood stabilizers. Lithium or lamictal. That is what treats your mood disorder and for the most part what you will always need. Other symptoms either bipolar in nature or created by the mood stabilizer get treated by other secondary meds. Insomnia? Probably seroquel. Psychotic features? Probably abilify. Tremors? Gabapentin. Anxiety? Stay the fuck away from benzos even if they try to give them to you. Is this generally the consensus? I feel like in the mental health community people just think drugs are drugs and maybe something will work eventually. That feels sad from my perspective. I do 1800mg Li along with 10g seroquel to sleep as needed 25mg bupropion as needed during seasonal depression and 40mg propranolol for performance anxiety when I need to perform. Its a lot of drugs but its really just the lithium at the core of it. Thoughts? ,Bipolar

45478,How do you contact your pdoc outside of appointments? Hey all posting under alt throwaway for reasons.I recently had a pdoc retire which meant dealing with the lovely process of finding a new one. It took months and was all around bad. So I finally started seeing this new doc and things are looking better...Except last week I started getting some side effects from a meds tweak we had agreed on. I wanted to register my experiences with the doctor before they got lost to my utterly fractured memory.Let me note that over the past decadeplus I have worked with six other pdocs and every single one of them offered two direct contact channels at least a private voicemail box and a private email. They have all been clear that answers were not guaranteed let alone timely and emergencies always go to 911. Most had a list of oncall staff you could talk to within minutes.Biggest thing for me is the privacy. Legal implications aside I don't want ANYONE readinglistening to the stuff I disclose to my pdoc.So here's the kicker. New doc gave me his contact card at initial appointment so far so good. Dumbass me loses the card. Call receptionist to ask doctor to get in touch either via email or phone.I was told that the receptionist is the best person to email and straight up didn't get an answer to the phone question. Not even a we can have the doctor call you when they get a chance.On top of this a ton of people are telling me this is MY broken expectations and doctors never give out contact info.I am so confused frustrated angry and generally miserable about this... And the original side effects are getting worse.Is my experience really that weird? Or do these people just not have a clue?Someone tell me I'm not crazy! Ok that would be a lie.,Bipolar

46128,Mental deterioration In the past few days I have been feeling a burgeoning amount of hatred that is warping my beliefs. I am normally a very empathetic and kind person that punishes himself for his constant mistakes and apologizes constantly.I hurt myself before hurting another person and I am overly sensitive to criticism. But talking with the person I felt hurt me and reconciling was easy enough. All it took was one conversation and everything would be good.But that hatred seemed to warp me into a completely different person. I have a very hard time empathizing and I can't be affected by criticism or even emotions. When my girlfriend or best friend cried I would feel all their feelings and comfort them genuinely.But even when my best friend was crying on me I couldn't feel anything. Even she noted that she said It didn't feel normal it didn't feel like you were really there. I feel like you don't really care about me.I have a history of mental illness my psychiatrist thinks I am bipolar but I suspect otherwise. I am supposed to be on lithium but I stopped taking it two days ago. These changes happened before lithium and have been present in the past without lithium so it isn't medication.That and my willpower feels boosted I went back to the gym and train much better and more consistently. I shower regularly do all my work and meditate before sleeping. I have much better impulse control and I am much calmer. I don't feel fazed by anything anxiety fear sadness even my usual depression. Other things I have been doing the one I find slightly disturbing is I made a list of all the people I have ever known.Each day I write out what they have done to make me hate them and I conclude that they are worthless to me. So far I have done 10 people and I no longer feel the slightest bit of attachment. When I write out the thoughts it feels like someone is telling me these.When I hesitate he mocks me and laughs about my weakness and tells me the truth. Although the truth is painful to swallow it feels like he is my darker self and he is gradually taking control.He has had his moments throughout my life where he took complete control and caused havoc without any mind to the consequences. When I was younger he would make me steal money and cause my parents stress.But as I grew older he grew calmer and more scheming. To the extent where he never consciously manifested and took control but rather suggested to me what seemed to be rational decisions. But as of late he seems ambitious since I am dealing with very traumatic repressed memories. He appeared smirking in my mirror mocking me he appeared in my dreams hunting me down. He corned me in every part of my life slowly breaking me.Hahaha I can feel him right now slowly killing me. I wonder how much longer I have left until I am nothing more than a calloused unemotional monster. When my best friend told me I was fake it deeply disturbed me. What the hell is going on with me?,Bipolar
45488,Really bad new symptom and want to make sure I'm thinking of everything to tell my pDoc. I'm having a really hard time. My brain just isn't working right. I have to type everything I'm saying 2 or 3 times I've never had a problem with that before. I play hockey and I'm usually pretty good and now I had no idea what to do with the puck. I even missed a pDoc appointment because I couldn't find the office I have been to probably 50 times. I just couldn't work out where it was. I'm trying to work out anything that's different or not to tell him. I've not sleeping differently I'm not taking any over the counter meds I'm not changing my prescription meds No dietary changes.What else should I think about to tell him? It's been like this for a couple days and I'm really scared. I've been stable for a while and this is the worst I've been in a very long time. edit And now my pDoc is sick and I can't get an appointment until Tuesday. Which is pretty shitty.,Bipolar
46334,Imo rbipolar has become too mainstream How many people on rbipolar actually have that condition? Seems like a good percentage of the posts on there are just people complaining about stuff everyone will go through at some point. Seems like some are self diagnosed and are just trying to fit into the whole being bipolar is cool fad. Its not fun or cool when you hurt people are actually permanently damage your future and loose friends. I can get the humor appeal of that sub but I mean come on. This disease isnt something that should be taken lightly. Even one of my coping mechanisms is humor but half the stuff in there is just dumb shit.,Bipolar
45819,Here we go again My therapist said I was hypomanic yesterday I don't know why she says this as I've been feeling stable as ever lately. I am having some sleep troubles yes but I'm not feeling sped up or anything. I suppose I have been engaging in some reckless spending and grandiose goaldirected behavior but that's about it. I mean it's possible but I'm not getting the buzzing I usually do when I'm hypo. Is it possible to be hypomanic and not be aware of it? I usually am which is the strange thing. ,Bipolar
46222,I feel euphoria. I was diagnosed BP1 almost 10 years ago but if you go through my comment history you can see some of my backstory with this disorder. Since November I have spent almost every moment outside of class and work in my room. I stopped reaching out to friends and would just lay in my bed trying to drown my life out with movies. Id go to bed at 7pm every night and just wake up early just so I had more time awake to lay in bed and do nothing. I was doing great at work and finished my semester strong but it took the life out of me basically. New Years Eve I finally decided to go out with friends after not drinking since October. I wasnt drinking on purpose because of my depressed mood. I didnt over do it but I was definitely drunk and didnt get home til 4am. The next morning I woke up around 11 and it was like a switch was flipped. Instead of wanting to be sedentary in my room all day I suddenly couldnt sit still and had motivation and energy. That night I couldnt get to sleep until after 3am and had racing thoughts all night. I didnt feel terrible though thankfully just restless. This isnt my first rodeo so I picked up the signs that Im going into an up swing and notified my doctor and preemptively took an extra dose of my antipsychotic Im allowed to add doses as needed and took a small dose of Ativan .25mg. Today i havent taken any extra doses but man do I feel incredible. Not out of control though by any means. I wont let it get that far. But I went months living like an empty shell and now I feel a fire in my soul. Im going on an overnight trip with a female friend from school tonight. Wish me luck guys. ,Bipolar

45446,Wondering If Im Bipolar... So for as long as I can remember Ive had issues with mental health. It didnt get bad until around 12 when I started selfharming and eventually I was hospitalized at 14 after a suicide attempt. There I was put on Zoloft for depression and also diagnosed with anxiety. For a few months I felt happy so I figured it was working. I stopped cutting I felt good. Eventually I just stopped taking it without a doctors consent but I took myself off of it slowly. I started cutting again after that. Thats my only experience with doctorspsychologists since and Im 19 turning 20 in 5 months. I had my first hallucination when I was 16 but the timeline is so bad and foggy because my brain literally cant remember anything besides the event itself I was in the shower and just like flicking a switch I thought somebody was in the bathroom with me trying to get me. Immediately I opened the curtains to find nothing but still wasnt convinced. I went to my room thinking something was following me from behind the entire time and closed my door psychotically looking around for whatever was there trying to get me. For about 3 hours I sat in the corner of my room looking back and forth between things that would just escape my direct line of sight it was like I could only see the things trying to get me in the corner of my eye. I wouldnt move off my bed in fear that it was under my bed and would snatch me that way. It felt so real at the time. I forgot it even happened the next day and didnt remember it until months later when it randomly popped into my mind but I couldnt place it along a coherent timeline only that it had happened sometime that same year. A few months after I remembered the event I was in class and out of nowhere just like last time I thought somebody who in my head looked similar to the girl from the ringexorcist was inside the room with me. I started darting my eyes everywhere making sure that she wasnt it felt real but apart of me knew it wasnt but that didnt help it go away. All throughout the day I continued feeling like she was right behind a closed door or peaking out at me from somewhere. On the bus ride home I was convinced she was somehow following me in vans in cars buildings this thing that was following me didnt adhere to the normal rules of transportation she could transport between buildings just to keep an eye on me. It happened about three or four times varying on levels of intensity for about two weeks and that was the last time Ive had delusions or hallucinations if thats even what they are. Now fast forward to 2017 where after smoking weed one night I get put into this semicatatonic state where I felt unreal like a joke and like where I lived and the people around me were fake too. All kinds of memories of my childhood were playing on fastforward on my head except I was outside looking at my younger self and it was terrifying I was convinced that I was actually going to die. Now this experience is druginduced but after this first time I began having experiences like this without being high and the thoughts couldnt leave my mind I felt unreal fake all the time and occasionally I wouldnt be able to view the world around me as real or the people. This happened between July 2017 December 2017 and its just starting to subside after I quit weed a few days ago. But while it was happening it left me in a severe depression. Now since the new year I have been energetic and positive I feel better about my body which all throughout my life I have struggled with and have positive thoughts about it. And not just I love my body! its more like I can 100 fix my body and make it how I want it! I didnt sleep for 40 hours straight albeit a 2.5 hour nap before my shift. During work I was talkative which I NEVER am and had something to say to about 99 of the customers. It was almost as if when the thought popped in my head no matter what it was I had to say it. Nothing inappropriate mostly just about the products or casual talk or responses but it was so natural. My answers are NEVER natural because I have social anxiety Im always rethinking it before I say it. But not this time. I bagged their groceries so fast I couldnt stop singing songs in my head occasionally singing them outloud in front of customers and not feeling embarrassed like casual singing when you have a song stuck in your head except it was a few different songs When I wasnt with a customer I couldnt not be moving my hands my legs etc.Once I got home I became obsessed with watching and rewatching and tweeting about my favorite show. I had so many thoughts about the show and my favorite characters that I just had to put them out there. I think I tweeted about 500600 times within 6 hours. On top of that I was also writing some characters for a TV show Im writing and usually Im a little stunted w writing because Im usually depressed but it was like I could write for ages. I wrote like 10 characters within an hour. This has been going on since the New Year and Ive gotten a total of... less than 20 hours of sleep within 5 days. And now I just got the idea that I want to finally get my license so I can get a car and runaway. I know logically the plan seems bad but its like I have no intention of doing anything else? Like all of my effort is going into that plan. And lastly on top of all this I havent eaten one meal since the new year and I dont feel hungry at all. No desire to eat really albeit a few snacks here and there. Ive had past experiences with being energetic so I always speculated whether I was bipolar but never like this. 90 of the time I have been depressedSo sorry this was long but please how do I know if this is really bipolar? Since these symptoms started Ive also become obsessed with researching hypomaniamania and the thought will not leave my brain. So am I just making the symptoms up or am I actually bipolar?????,Bipolar

46425,Lamictal alone? LamictalWellbutrin combo? Looking for advice... Hi! My first post after extensive lurking... and yes it's a meds question.I'm on 1200 lithium and 200 Lamictallamotrigine. The Lamictal has been the first thing that's worked for me lifting some of my current depression.My psychiatrist has acted like lithium is a necessary beallendall drug but from reading here I see that that's not the case. I don't think it has ever done anything for me including a good 2 weeks in the hospital on lithium alone with zero improvement. Thyroid issues already run in my family so I'm worried about that. And recently it's also given me terrible acne. Maybe I'm vain but I can't live with that. So I want to go off it.QuestionIs anyone on Lamictal alone? How does it work for you?Also I've noticed that a lot of people here seem to be on a LamictalWellbutrin combo. I'm still experiencing depression and did even prior to my dx and I know Wellbutrin doesn't have the weight and libido problems that other antidepressants do so I'm interested in trying that. I'm hoping it could also help with low energy from the Lamictal.Question 2What is this combo like? And what did doctors say about its efficacy why it should be used? My psychiatrist is a resident in a hospital clinic so she is pretty conservative I need a good argument.PSI'm bipolar I but welcome all responses. Thanks very much.,Bipolar
45790,Afraid of being a hypochondriac The title says a lot. I saw a comment a few days back saying people with bipolar tend to be hypochondriacs as well. My first reaction was not me! Now Im not so sure.I have a UTI with kidney pain. I know this because I have chronic UTIs and have for most of my adult life. I also have a bladder that has moved lower due to having four children. ANYHOW...I know the symptoms and I have been waiting to make sure it wasnt in my head or simple dehydration before going to the doctor. Today is Saturday and thankfully his practice is open on weekends. I havent called yet but I will when they open. The pain is worse this morning.And then I realized that every time I get a cold I recheck the symptoms of the flu pneumonia etc. in order to rule those things out.If I get a rash I will look up different rashes to make sure its not some flesh eating bacteria. I had shingles behind my knees last year and wrote it off as dermatitis and didnt go to see my doctor until it hurt too much to walk.I guess Im sort of the opposite. I try to rule out worse illnesses? But then I thought hey maybe thats how you justify it but youre a hypochondriac silly.Except when it comes to UTIs. I know every symptom Ive experienced.,Bipolar

Numb days I do not struggle to do everyday basic things such as brushing my teeth but even if I feel the energy to do my work for uni i sit there and do not know how to proceed. I know what I need to do but it is like I do not understand anything at the same time. If things do not work out the first time I try I cannot thing of another way or solution to do it. I ask my friend most of the times but the anwser is always so obvious that I start to feel embarrassed to ask and I am scared that I am giving her extra stress.What can I do to clear my mind and do my work? I do not even have intrusive thoughts I actually I have nothing in mind but it does not feel clear either and I struggle to have a logical thinking to work. What can I do?

7776,Feels like the an episode of a soap opera but the title pretty much sums it up.I am 24 now and started attending university at 18. At 19 I got Pyloric Stenosis which went undiagnosed for nearly 6 months I lost 49 of my body weight and due to the impeccable timing missed both the first year final exams and the retakes due to illness. During this time my gf of three years broke up with me over Facebook while I was sitting in a hospital bed waiting for an MRI my grandad had a heart failure and died within 12 hours and a week after leaving hospital for the final time my Mother confesses she was diagnosed with breast cancer about a month prior she survived luckily.It took two years of feeling sorry for myself to try tinder and there I met the most amazing person I am now engaged to they convinced me to go back to University but closer to home as the Uni I was attending had Campuses across the UK.And so I did and had an incredible time got to travel to other counties to tour was lucky enough to work with an artist who I now have work with on Spotify huge personal victory and since have released music with the band I am a active member of which was probably the proudest moment of my life. However I have diagnosed ADHD Dyslexia Dyspraxia Depression and Anxiety book smarts just is not my forte but I usually get by until a global pandemic happens and I had to do my final year at home in my bedroom this was my kryptonite but I was still moving along fine. Up until about an hour ago my father was taken to hospital by ambulance last Monday traumatic stuff but we have a family history of being unwell constantly so I managed to not let it drop me getting these final pieces done. He called about an hour ago to tell me they were finally able to get a better understanding of what happened and confirm it is Lung Cancer.I do not know why is was the final straw but I have no idea how to handle this new level of nothingness My Dad just got diagnosed with cancer 22 hours before my final deadline for my degree,Depression

I know if I surround myself with ppl it will happen. Its just I hate being around ppl. But I hate being lonely. And. Probably even worse. Relationships r so painful for me. I am not a functional human being. I am so afraid of ppl. Have no self worth. And yet I want a gf. Maybe to gain self worth? No. Idk y and I do not have to give a reason. I just fucking want one. I need a gf,Depression
7235,Stay positive friends i had been recently going through a rough tine hard break up and alot going on no one in particular has stepped into my life yet but I am really not searching to hard I have moved forward and things are bigger and brighter the ever it all works out stay happy and head held high Positivity,Depression
7676,My partner broke up with me. We dated for 8 months and were extremely co dependant. It was not a healthy relationship because she did not want to get better and I wanted her to. We met up and she is with someone else as soon as a month after an extreme alcoholic drinking 750mls every night and I am still in love with her.The breakup is what originally sent me into the depression but it was not just that. Where I live was going above and beyond with covid restrictions even though people were getting vaccinated and you would be fined for even seeing your family. My parents were being insane my brother was not doing well and it took a huge toll on me too. More than I know I think.Then I made the impulsive decision to get an apartment right after the breakup. The move in date is September 1st and as much as I should be happy that makes me even more depressed for some reason.I have no friends with depression I have no one that talks to me constantly my ex did so I am feeling extremely lonely after just getting cut off from that and I just feel so exhausted and alone. I want to go out but I want to be alone. I feel nothing literally nothing. I am just a numb husk that gets stuck in depressive thought loops over and over and wakes up to panic attacks.I have been in bed for over a week now my room is beyond disgusting I cannot eat and look like skin and bones and my Dad basically has to take care of me because I cannot. I have gone out once or twice but I feel nothing the whole time. I cannot live like this. I have clinical depression and have extremely intense depressive episodes multiple times a year but this is the worst one I have had since I was in fucking jr high. I am in college now. I think I am suicidal but I am so numb and empty I cannot even tell. The healthcare system in general let alone the mental healthcare where I live is abysmal but I am genuinely considering calling the crisis line and getting myself admitted to the mental health ward. The only thing stopping me is how much it would affect my family.I just feel so lost and SO alone and I do not know what to do. I think I came here to just talk to more people who are struggling like me but if you have any advice please let me know. I am so tired. I am in one of the worst depressive episodes of my life.,Depression

8418,Pretending to the world like I do not have a problem.Mental health service at work message a therapist that might answer in 24 hours and then when you get an appointment it is only 15 minutes and they just tell you a breathing exercise.Have tried working on personal projects doing extra online training for work and even fuck off and play video games but I do not care.that is really it. Ok thx for reading I have been sitting here in the same spot for like 3 days,Depression
7980,I have been taking my meds and since then my depression has kind of frozen. I did not feel anything and was complaining numb and disassociating. When I told my doctor this he decided to bump me down with the dosage so now I started feeling less numb but with that I feel more depressed and unstable. My self harm urges are gradually getting bigger and bigger and my nights are getting longer each day. I am honestly terrified to start school again because if I am feeling unstable now.. who knows how bad it will hit me then. Its all coming back,Depression
8580,Feeling less motivated by the day. Use to heavily train at gym almost everyday now thought of putting myself through all that taxing work makes me groan internally. do not like looking in mirror despite being objectively good lookinghot or taking time to self analyze. Feel lazy and just want to smoke weed and do nothing. have not had a relationship in 7 years since fucking middle school have not gotten laid in a year have more fingers on 1 hand than I do friends.And the hate for myself is growing every single day. I may have people around that want to help but I would never and will never confide to them. They will never understand what I am going through or why. I think depression is upon me,Depression

8266,I have struggled with anxiety depression my whole life. I have extreme anxiety which I think ultimately makes me depressed. I put off dealing with the issues for years because of stigma and just not understanding what was going on. In my late teens my mom finally forced me start medicine and see a therapist. I had a lot of bad circumstances but after I graduated college my life suddenly started looking up. A few months after graduating the most amazing thing happened. I met this cute funny guy through mutual friends and he asked me out on a date. There was an instant attraction. We talked everyday and began dating officially a month later. It was the happiest Id ever been in my life. I had a job I moved out of my parents house I had friends and I had a loving boyfriend. My life was finally coming together how I wanted it. I thought maybe my depression and anxiety are finally gone. I was always anxious about something bad happening because my life seemed too good to be true.Then just a few weeks after we celebrated our 6 month anniversary my boyfriend came over to my house one day and dumped me. I was completely blindsided. He told me he just was not as invested in the relationship as he should be and was not falling in love with me. He cut me off and never reached out even on my birthday. My life fell apart. All of my anxiety and depression came back in full swing.I realized that I am not valued or competent at my job all of my friends have boyfriends who they would much prefer to hang out with. And honestly? I miss living with my parents and can barely afford to make it by. I hate my life. Everyday I go to sleep and hope that I just do not wake up. I want to disappear. I frequently fantasize about suicide but I know I am not brave enough to do it. I have put my poor parents through enough by creating such a mess of my life. Nothing can make it better just have to keep dealing with the pain of life. I think this is rock bottom,Depression
9061,So I am not exactly suicidal but I just do not feel like being alive. I am only 18 and this is my 2nd time going through some serious trama a few years ago my best friend took her own life and I got help for that but now I got this other type of trama that most do not even consider trama. it is called betral trama it happens when someone your super close to does something that is unforgivable to you but unlike normal PTSD you have this need to be around them. And it can come from a parent or a relationship mine is from a relationship. I used to be able to meditate and when I meditate I sometimes go into sleep paralysis so... Not the best time to have flashbacks everytime. But I am in this pretty constant state of hopelessness to where I am constantly wishing I was not alive but I do not really want to die and I do not want my ex back but also do even tho I know how toxic and inconsiderate she was. But I am just wondering if anyone has any advice on what I can do to get rid of these feelings because I cannot keep living like this it is been a month and I still have no clue what to do. Idk what to do,Depression
6966,I have been severly bullied since i was 5 till 15 this resulted in me being a depressed misanthrope with ptss and multiple anxiaty dissorders. I am now 18 have no friendsor social contacts. my study will be online so i will not meet people there i do not sport since i have poor health because i was sick when i was a child. I do not drink so going to a bar to meet new people is not it i do not like party's or festivals since its too crowded and filthy dating sites are shit since most people that are on it are superficial and even with the rare ocasion i get a match and message them i get no response I am just done. I have wonderfull close family whom i love alot but i just do not want to deal with this constant loneliness does anyone have some recomandation of wich activatys would bring me more into contact with people i do not have any hobbies or special intrest besides my obsesive facination about war and the reasons etc How long am i suposed to go on until the better days come,Depression
7911,Sometimes I just sit here and cannot figure out why we live. Why do I exist? Our individual lives are so unimportant so what is the point of living. I just feel so lost sometimes. I do not know what I want to do for school and even if I did I have no motivation to do it because in the end what does it mean. I do not know I am just struggling to find purpose rn and I feel like my presence just does not matter. Nothing really does matter Do you guys ever wonder what the purpose of life is.,Depression
6979,I have been talking to someone who I really liked. They were a great person and we really clicked. I told her that I could not do this with her because I am dealing with so much shit in my head that it is not fair to her. She said she wanted to be there for me and I shut her down. I am scared to be depressed around other people now. My poor mental health ruined one relationship and I do not want it to ruin another. I know I am much better now than I was in my previous relationship but I am scared that I might be a horrible person again.I am scared to let anyone be close. I feel like I am just getting by daily and cannot make any real connections anymore. The ability to get close to people is nonexistent because I am scared that when they see the real me they will leave. I am trying to improve but what if I cannot what if I fall apart again? What if I am the piece of shit suicidal asshole that I was before? I am scared to put anyone through that. I kept making up excuses for why this was not going to work out. Distance what we wanted culture but truthfully I am just fucking scared to be close to someone again. I am scared to be vulnerable. I wish I knew how to not be depressed. It controls my life. I hate it I am pushing people away,Depression
9009,So its been already a month and a half since I started feeling really bad like the meds does not kick in anymore. So as my psychotherapist in vacations I want to know what are my options before I discuss them with him Anti depressors are not effectives anymore and I am already at a very high dosage what is the options I have ?,Depression
9124,I do not know how to express my thoughts and feelings without feeling like an idiot I have programmed myself to never feel externally as a means of survival I have a solid exterior but inside I am torn to pieces.During my childhood I constantly moved around going to different schools cities I was never able to settle because my mother is a hardcore alcoholic running from any responsibility.I used to come back from primary school and walk in on my mother passed out. I used to sit and entertain myself for hours in a silent life less home.I used to worry about bills electricity and food before I would even hit my teenage years. I had to walk my mother to the shop whilst she leant her entire weight upon my shoulder we would stagger there day or night just so she could get her drink.When I went to school I could not relate to the other kids I could not laugh with them I did not watch the same programs or like the same things I did not have any siblings a father I had no guidance.During my teens I used to jump into relationships with girls but I was never stable enough to hold it down. I would go to school and fight the other kids distract them in class. I was full of anger and resentment. I did not feel understood my teachers called me names made an example out of what not to be. I was the disruptive naughty kid. I was given detentions put on report constantly punished.I would come home to the same cycle my mother passed out or mentally checked out. Her pupils would change when she was drunk I would know my mother was gone.Now I am 22 years old still living with my mother stuck in a shit hole city. I somehow managed to get a degree determined to fight against the hand I would been dealt.I have been through waves of acceptance anger depression. It never truly goes away.My mother stopped drinking supposedly found spirituality and detached from her ego. I thought she was healing I was so proud of her and for once my home started to feel safe...I told her I think I aced a job interview today.. She started telling me all of the negatives. The areas not safe people there will hurt you. You will not like it it will be boring. you are bad at maths you will not be able to do it.I have a solid exterior I am a fully grown man now I am tall broad the one thing my father gave me was good genes. I am capable I am strong intelligent. I have held down jobs in the past I was a manager before I went to university.Tonight I ask her to not be so negative I ask her why she cannot just be happy and support me for trying to better my life.. she tells me that she has done her 18 years of service to me. She says I am holding onto the energy of the past that it is time to move on.. She tells me I should leave the house if I hate her so much.. She tells me I am selfish a narc that I hold her past I have her head out of spite..I am sitting here feeling pain I feel alone there is nobody in this world who truly has my back but me there is nobody to pull me out of the gutter when I am in need.. There is nobody there who will truly help me..I feel so jealous of people who were raised in a loving environment. I watch people I went to school with living life driving living independently.. Here I am barely able to make enough to pay off my debts let alone save enough to leave.. The rent in my city is insane.I tried supported housing for 6 months but living around a house full of people with hardcore drug issues made me feel like I was still at home.. People trying to come into my room.. Dirt and grime everywhere outside of my door.. Shit on the sink in the shared bathroom..Everything is so hard. I am struggling to keep fighting. I cannot tell anyone how I feel in real life I am supposed to be this big impenetrable guy who people can rely on..When I try to speak to people nobody takes. It seriously.How much more can I take? When will life cut me a break? I just want to be happy I just want to be independent away from damaged crazy people.. 22M Narc alcoholic parent,Depression
7608,I feel so worthless and unwanted and I have nowhere to go. I am never good enough for anybody and I cannot stop breaking down in my empty house. I thought things would be better but they are only getting worse and I am scared. I am hurting so badly in ways I cannot explain and I have nobody when I need someone the most. Please help I am all alone and it hurts so bad,Depression
8689,Life is all shitty thing after shitty thing. you study for a degree that you do not really care anymore bc the environment is so stressful for so little knowledge payoff that it just seems like ur wasting everyone is time the school fucks up ur schedule even if you try to stay at the top of ur game even tho you feel like ur not learning anything useful specifically to not have problems with that and now you cannot even try to change classes even tho they are simply STILL HIRING the ppl who should have been teaching you since semester started weeks ago. And then you graduate to work in an ok career will not get much but at least I am going to be able to have a job just to feel like you have not actually learned a dang thing which forces you to go BACK to that academic setting that makes you want to actually commit ever since you were in school being the butt of everyone is joke while still trying to manage working because you have to get out of ur parents house as soon as possible to live in whatever shitty place you can get if you want to cut an inch off your hair. Even tho ur parents were living at your grandmas ur whole childhood and she did not give a shit what they did with their bodies you do not get the same range because of take a guess fucking politics! That are not getting any better bc no matter what fucktards get in power you are still going to be discriminated against for the rest of your life on at least 3 dif bases and the people who fight for udont actually they just want ur vote. you are probably going to be alone also because the person you love is also dying to go back to her home state one of the less diverse regions in the country and wants to live moving places whereas with you that just sounds like a lot of planning and uncertainty and a lot of planning and uncertainty sounds like even more stress mocing around w ur profession that is not that easy but hey i got no ambition anyways so maybe that can be arranged. And it does not even matter bc there is no long run the planet is literally fucjing dying! All and all feels impossible to simply get over all of it and live normally Just feels impossible not to be depressed,Depression

8962,I have been dealing with depression anxiety ptsd and multiple other disorders for several years. some years were better than others while some i barely made it through. I have gone on multiple medications and countless therapists outpatients changing environments constantly. another shitty year for me I have been loosing myself left and right. the last few weeks have been the worst and i cannot even put my finger on what is been causing it. every single night its another struggle in my head and living alone and rarely leaving my place or even talking to family or friends I am isolated. its not like i have the energy or will power to explain to a bunch of people what i can barely grasp my head around. all they would ever say is that its been almost ten years now and that i need to get over it go outside more. I have tried everything i mean everything. every night is another battle. I am proud of myself for even making it this far. yet i still cannot stop hating myself for all I have caused people. forget other people what I have caused for myself. and like every other night for the past few years. ill sit and contemplate every single thing I have done and tire myself out with the thinking to finally get a break from myself and sleep only to wake up and repeat another rough night,Depression
7152,I started having depression since i was 17 or smth i am 24 now. From that age it just feels like this feeling of being so damn depressed comes and goes. Its very hard to wake up each day and to live through that i hate it so much i feel like I do not want to go on anymore. I also have bad anxiety throughout the day i feel like I cannot breathe and my heart beats so fast and i feel dizzy. So its like every day is harder to go by. I think I am going to go to a therapist but for now i really need some type of relief even if its for a few hours i have this medication in my home called tramadol I have been googling about it but I am not sure is it a type of medication that helps with these anxiety and depression if i take at least a small dose of it? If anyone has any info about it please tell me I have been feeling very depressed for almost 3 weeks now,Depression
8185,Possible TW because its about self harm and mental hospitals ig... I really do not know where to ask this so I am asking here if I missed something in the rules and its not allowed here please tell me! Ok so I am 13F. I was friends with this girl a couple years ago before we moved. Recently her family moved in with us temporarily until they can get on their feet get a house and such. So its their mom my old friend 11F and her brother 9M. I am not really friends with her anymore and am now more friends with her brother. Since we have become friends I have realized he is most likely depressed though he has not been diagnosed and has been occasionally harming himself. Not cutting but scratching himself with his nails or sharp objects but that does not make it any less worrying. I am also depressed I have been diagnosed so my parent are aware and have self harmed still kind of am. that is one of the reason we became friends because we could bond over our feelings and opinions. We have a group chat with his sister and had kind of vented there. She got worried apparently and showed our moms. They got really mad at us for talking about that sort of thing. Said it was inappropriate and we should have come to them if we were feeling like that. And his mom said if they were sad depressed or self harming that they would be sent to a mental hospital and would not be able to see her for months. No talk about the severity just in general if they were or were doing any of those things that they would have to go to one.. We ended up getting grounded from our devices because of it. I know her saying that made my friend really anxious and uncomfortable talking about going to somewhere like that.Since then I have heard her say that and things similar to that some in more detail to my friend and his sister. I know it always makes him uncomfortable and upset. Idk would she be considered toxic or is she justified in saying stuff like that? Sorry for the long explanation Do you guys think my friends mom is being toxic?,Depression
7835,So...I feel unsure about posting this because I am not sure if it is too good to be true... or maybe people will not believe me. But I think I am going to be ok and I want to share what I think really finally worked. I have major depressive disorder generalised anxiety disorder and CPTSD from years of childhood sexualising abuse and violence. I drink too much I hate myself. I have always had issues with needing an outside substance to numb that pain. Drugs booze sex.... you know how it goes. The last few months have beeny worst. I constantly thought about offing myself.Last December I contacted a clinical hypnotherapist about help to cut down my drinking. I connected with her instantly. We spoke about why I drank and my past came up...as it does when you have seen a many health professionals as I have and are used to going through the motions. She talked to me about a process called The Richards Trauma Process TRTP. it is 3 sessions. Session 1 stop self sabotageSession 2 address and leave behind the traumaSession 3 set yourself up for the future. It does not retraumatize you. I have done EMDR CBT and years of talk therapy and they all retraumatise. Who wants to go through those events again??I did not do anything about it until 4 weeks ago because it cost 1200 and I had quit my job. But I was finally in a position to do it.Between Sessions 1 and 3 I have gone from severe depression severe anxiety and moderate stress to ZERO depression zero anxiety and severe stress. We figured out the stress was due to my new overwhelming desire to take care of myself and being a mother of very young children... that is quite hard. So Session 3 we spent on managing parental overwhelm. Tonight my kids were little shits and I did not care. I was fine. I did not snap. I did not cry. I did not descend into a panic attack like I have so many times before. I waited for them then we did puzzles and listened to music. Oh...and I went for a run this morning for the first time in months! I do not even know myself and it is insane to think about. Who even am I without trauma and mental illness. I think of my abuser and he seems insignificant. I look back on my trauma and it evokes no physical reaction. No knot in the stomach. No chest tightness. No heaviness in my body. it is as if I am looking into someone else's life. Not my own. I hope this helps someone. It has brought me back to life. TRTP Holy shit.,Depression
7109,I am just tired. There are a few external things that have just zapped my energy over the last few months and self care has gone out the window just trying to show up everyday. If it matters I am female and my hair is down mid back. I have no attachment to it though. And the thing is I really do not care about my hair I am just dreading the endless questions and quasi concern for the next few months. And upset because it is another sign that I am farther in the shit than I have acknowledged. it will grow back right? I am thinking of telling everyone I set my hair on fire? Or maybe a freak lawnmowervacuum accident? Possibly touring a lollipop factory when there was a flood and they all fell down in my hair? Aliens. I donno. I cannot move on without dealing with it. The way to deal with it is to shave it. I just have to do it right? Everything else can fuck off right? I am probably going to have to shave my head because of depression knots.,Depression
7984,I wanted to be intimate with my partner but I could not. He was over me making out with me but I began to cry and as his hands wandered it felt worse. It felt as I was looking at my motionless body laying there powerless and it felt as I was suffocating. I eventually was able to tell him to stop and left but I love him and we have done this before but lately anytime intimacy is close to happening I experience the same thing he does not know about my depression. No one does. I cannot be intimate,Depression
8685,I just had to write it finally idk. I just want to jump off a terrace headfirst and die. My chest is constantly hurting it is like someone is crushing my heart with their bare hands and yanking it out. My head is constantly aching and i do not feel anything. it is all at once. I do not even know what it feels like to be happy anymore or anything else that gives me happiness. I have given up on everything that I liked. I am just slogging through uni because I have to. I have no friends no emotional support and a boyfriend whom I am terrified of. I lie to him about being okay all the time because I know he will fight with me if I say why I am not doing well and it will end up ruining whatever time I spend with him which in turn will ruin my head even more. I want to die I just want to end it. I have been pulling it so far only because of my dog. he is the reason I have to live but nothing feels okay. This was not supposed to happen this was supposed to be the best time of our lives. I am 20f. I was bullied throughout my teenage years by school mates and before that my relatives. I have been subject to sexual abuse multiple times as a child and the perpetrators unharmed and successful right now. I am faking it for everyone. I just want to stab myself in the neck. I have attempted a few times before and failed. I fail at everything. I am broke useless ugly alone fucked up numb a burden to everyone. I want to delete myself TW mention of suicide,Depression
7634,Today is not a very good day and I just want to share it with someone who cares. I out of medication and it is very distressing that with just one day without meds can be really bad. I have been trying to contact with my doctor but she is not answering. I am feeling so alone. Sometimes I just want someone to asks me hey how are you?,Depression
8305,i went from 30 to 20 on Sunday and its day 3 and i have horrible anxiety and irritability. Does this pass Anyone lower dosage of Prozac and feel horrible?,Depression
8655,Specially for people like me who has no one to vent toI'm bad at giving advice and comforting people I see people who gives kind words and advice to posters here if i had unlimited awards ill spend it here Huge 'thank you' for the people who replies to posts here,Depression
7951,Why do I get up why do I want to do stuff. School is getting closer and closer and I just cannot do it. I cannot handle another year of trying. physically mentally and emotionally I am exhausted and no matter what I do I cannot recharge. Why cannot I just have a normal life with a normal family and normal family problems. Why cannot I run away or ask for help. I am trapped in a mental prison that I put myself in. Why cannot I remember what day it is but I can remember all the fucked up things that happened. Why did everything have to fall apart when I am old enough to understand everything. I want to yell to let out all the shit stuck in my head but I keep it in just to torment myself. I want to give up,Depression
8065,I put this together while sobbing so hard I almost made myself vomit last night. I had a pounding headache had to hold my breath so my parents would not hear me crying.I have been in love with her since 2018. Was rejected and ghosted in 2020. I cry constantly and have been grieving every day for 3 years. I have never hd a girlfriend before and I am 25. The pain from never being able to be with her has contributed to my decision to kill myself I have already attempted but failed to hang myself a few times. Its something I have to cope with every day. Its a sickness that never goes away. Its a pain that is not just emotional but physical. Again I have been dealing with this every single day since fall of 2018.It reads.Dear KI wish you knew how special you are to me. I wish you knew you how happy I would be if we were together. But I know that would not make you happy. So I have to let you be happy. That is what I want because I love you so much.I wish you knew how happy you make me. I wish you knew how full of love my heart is for you. I wish I could hold you in my arms and protect you so that no one could hurt you.When I was young I learned the word for always in French toujours. It always sounded like a beautiful graceful yet heavy word to me. Something about how it sounds. It sounds melancholy sentimental but genuine and strong.you will always be in my heart. Toujours. Always. you will always be in my heart. I promise.I love you so much. I have written a few suicide notes I am going to send to a few different people when I do it. This one is going to the girl I am in love with.,Depression
8246,It would just be nice to share perspective or see how other people help support their loved ones when things get tough or said loved ones are having bad episodes. But I also understand that hearing about said perspective and experience with living with depressed persons might come off as triggering to anyone who is depressed if I were depressed I would hate to see how my depression has affected others around me. it is an inevitable thing that happens and it is a complicated issue. But something that I think is not talked about much in my experience.it is a hard pill to swallow but being a part of a depressed persons support group can be really traumatizing when things get bad more so if you live with them. Like I have had to talk them down from suicide bring them out of their intrusive suicidal ideation induced by substance abuse cleaned up their blood after self harming occured having to see them in a psych ward being afraid of triggering an episode being afraid of walking in on a dead body in your own home. And that is not accounting for being there for another relative who was in the hospital after an attempt or having a best friend who is also medically depressed. It is all around me.TW VENT AHEADAnd no matter what despite all of that. you are always supposed to push down whatever feelings of anger and frustration or sadness you might have in favor of taking caresupporting the person that needs the most help at the moment. And feelings of resentment happen but I personally do not want to feel that way I feel that letting those negative emotions take over helps no one much less the person you want to help. But it is so hard sometimes and it is hard to talk about without sounding emotionally selfish to some capacity because you have a whole medically depressed person right there! so you automatically feel guilty for even taking your feelings in consideration. Like how dare you be negatively affected my someone else's depression fuck you! their well being and mental health is important than yours at the moment! Suck it up! and I know that sounds like an exaggeration but it is the reality of things. Like whatever I am feeling needs to take a back seat because I need to reserve my emotional energy for when another depressive episode from one of my relatives rolls around. And yes this person has a psyche a therapist and meds. If they did not have those things they would have definitely been gone by now but it still seems like it is going to be a while until they are able to manage their depression. it is just really hard and I feel so alone in these types of feelings I am having these feelings that i feel like I cannot afford to have. But that is not realistic and these feelings are there and they are eating away at me it makes me want to run away from it all. But again it can always be written off by a statement like this well whatever you are feeling I can guarantee you the depressed person is having a worse time than you right now and...they would be right!....and I go back to feeling like shit and the cycle continues. But I feel so written off constantly because I am in such constant and close proximity to depression i feel like I am not allowed to be cared about or acknowledge whatever it is I am going through or feeling. I just do not know if anyone feels this way. VENT OVERThat said I think a therapist would be the best answer to my plight but I do not have access to one no healthcare I am the process of having that be sorted out. And I know you can only do so much as a support you are not supposed to shoulder to much of a depressed persons burden but it is different when you live with them you see the depression and you experience their episodes from the outside except you are not exactly a bystander either and you got to get your hands dirty. So that is why i wanted to know if there is any collective of people who has experienced any situation similar. I do not know where else to ask this but is there a support group for relatives living with depressed persons? or a support group for the support group of a depressed individual? it is a unique experience and I would like to speak with others who have experience living with medically depressed persons.,Depression
8854,For more than a year now I have been waking up feeling like shit. Most of times there no apparent reason it has become kind of a morning ritual. My head pounds I feel extreme sadness and I really struggle to go about my daily chores. The situation improves as the day progresses and by mid daynoon I am able to do my job without much problem.But recently the morning depression has been getting worse accompanied by vivid dreaming every night. Now when I wake up I am more depressed than ever sometimes I think why did I stop dremaing why I had to wake up and I will not lie some bad thoughts have crossed my mind recently. Feeling really helpless now what should I do? Waking up everyday in the morning seems like literal torture with my head pounding and a mood so bad it makes me wonder is it worth living?,Depression
8287,that is it! I do not want to say more. I am just tired and I want to share this with people that are able to understand this state of mind. I am tired.,Depression
8700,Just for a moment to remember when nothing mattered and to experience what it was like to be genuinely happy. But knowing that is impossibleits a good thing. Knowing I have nothing to look forward to makes all the meaningless suffering just thateverythings predictable. Tm brings nothing..just waiting to die. Funny reminiscing on the past I realized none of it mattered. Every day is lost today will be tm and tm I am dead I want to go back for a little,Depression

8464,I am done. I have had enough of this crappy life and everything in it. I have had enough of people not caring. I have had enough of being alone. I do not want my life anymore. Goodbye,Depression
7502,amp see if anyone would feel bad about hurting me yelling at me abandoning me neglecting me amp abusing me. amp i hate to say it but i genuinely want people to feel like absolute shit about me being dead.. amp finally see how much pain they put me through. I want them to know that THEIR words amp THEIR actions caused me to take my life amp Ill be gone forever because of them.I want them to hurt the way i do. tbh i really want to die JUST to see if anyone would care.,Depression
8507,Seems once the antidepressant builds up in my system it just makes my productivity worse. Before meds I would have bad days and good days with most days being a mix but on meds it just seems to dull the highs and the lows and I am just in a consistently low state. All I would have to do in the past is wait for the depressive period to pass but now I just feel so out if it. I went from things having little satisfaction to them nearly having none it made me cut some bad habits but I have no motivation for anything now. I lost interest in music video games social media and more. On meds I just lay in bed and maybe watch a movie at best to pass the time waiting for the depressive period to pass but on the meds it never actually does pass. it is obvious I have some form of imbalance but the meds have such a profound effect on me and change me on such a fundamental level. They change some things for the better and others for the worse but ultimately it is just different not better. I have tried sertaline fluoxetine venlafaxine. I am assuming raising Sert is making my dopamine drop making my apathy worse. Curious if anyone else has experienced this. Feeling worse on medication,Depression
8137,I desperately want to leave. I am currently working a minimum wage job but I did not get a college degree I only have an associates and my dad whom I live with mocks me and makes fun of the fact that I cannot afford an apartment. Hes not even supportive he just makes fun of me and says Ill never be able to move out. And I desperately want to.And yeah why are apartments so expensive? Can I even afford a studio apartment? Idk.. I worked for 5 years at a cashier and never got a raise no one did because the company went bankrupt. It was minimum wage. I hated it so I changed jobs and applied literally everywhere for 6 months and got the animal shelter gig. I am currently working at this dead end animal shelter job even though I enjoy it. Been doing this for the last 3 years. So yeah I am tired of him making fun of me I am tired of feeling stuck I wish I could move out with a minimum wage job I do not know what bachelors degree I want I do not know if Ill be able to even make time to get a bachelors degree i do not have friends to move out with I do not want roommates I am just tired of not knowing what to do.. Pathetic post incoming 31F still living at home,Depression
6984,Not because of death but because she wanted to get away.I have been depressed for over 10 years and maybe this is the lowest point I have ever been to.The last few days it seems like there is been an invisible force squeezing my chest all the time. I can barely eat. I spent 48 hours with only 1 sandwich in my stomach and after that I have forced myself to eat just to be able to get drunk after I get home from work just so the time goes by quickly and I do not feel this damn pain.She was my last friend. I am completely alone now.Losing people is always a disgrace to me but ok. I have known this friend for 6 years and even though we had a few periods without talking we were doing well for almost 2 years we never even had a fight until last week.Turns out I was pretty drunk and I ended up insisting on telling her that she did not really care about me and how I was a nobody to her. I really insisted on it because I was drunk and could not even think straight although she said clearly that she did care.Turns out she was hurt and does not want to talk to me anymore.She was the only person who really mattered and it made me want to keep living I did not want to bring her pain.I tried to apologize tried to ask him to understand and forgive me but to no avail.The worst thing is that I did not even want to attack her the way I did it is very easy for me to think that someone does not like me after all I myself think I am rubbish and in no way worthy of any love.I did not even sleep the night that happened. I spent the whole night thinking about how I could kill myself.what is the fucking point on living if my life is a piece of thrash and I feel bad absolutely all the time? I suck at everything and have no friends to have fun with. The ones I had I ruined it. How to deal with the pain of losing someone when you are depressed and that person was one of the pillars of your life?,Depression

7021,I have been reaching out for help. I do EVERYTHING that I am told to help me feel better.Well today I called a place about the sexual abuse I went through as a kid. A charity that gives therapy to people who have gone through that.Well. Because I was not raped it is not deemed bad enough. I was simply molested for 2 years by a neighbor as a kid so they do not think I can get help from them.I was referred to this place by a NHS mental health team who keep referring to these places. One place will tell me I am too severe to help. And now this place says what happened was not bad enough. I was not even abused the right way. Even my abuse was done wrong.Which is the SECOND time I have heard it this week about TWO different types of abuse. And then people have the cheek to ask me why I am so miserable. I am literally asking for help and doing all the rubbish I am told to do and yet here we are.Damn. Just damn.please no it gets better. That makes me feel worse EVERY TIME I was just told my abuse was not severe enough,Depression
8446,Anyone here who has depression at the same time suffers with Irritable Bowel Syndrome IBS? How do you guys manage? Do you meet with a dietitian? Does stressor when your depression symptoms get worse does your IBS symptoms get worse too? Thank you and any help would be appreciated. Depression and Irritable Bowel Syndrome IBS,Depression
8690,I wish I could start over again. I feel like I missed out. I feel like I have not developed. I am generally content but only when there is absolutely no pressure on me. As soon as there is even a smidge of pressure and am alone I lose control over my emotions and stress out over everything.I guess I should write a bit about myself. I am 22 have asperger syndrome live with my parents and attend university forestry major. In primary school and highschool everyone called me smart. All my live I kind of strolled through it with no resistance. I was happy. I never had trouble with anything. But once I entered university that gradually changed. Suddenly things became hard people had expectations of me. I have to know what is to come months in advance and prepare for it.I feel fake. I do not have the passion for foresty my other classmates had. I only chose this major because I kind of liked biology class in highschool. But I never had a passion for it. In highschool I could just stroll along and do fine but that just does not work anymore. Everyone wants me to know what I want. I do not know what I want! Or its more like I do know what I want I just want an easy life. An easy job. I wish I joined a college instead or maybe some kind of trade school maybe I could have learned carpentry or plumbing or how to fell trees. Id be happy just working under a boss 9 to 5 just do as I am told. I could have had my own home by now if I did that. Id be able to come home after work and do something else. Play some games watch TV maybe get into a new hobby like reading or writing maybe try dating. I cannot do any of that in college. I am constantly anxious and overwhelmed and I cannot pay attention and I do not know what to do and I fear that all jobs in this field will be equally stressful and exhausting.Despite the trouble I described I largely made it through all my classes. I actually only have 1 test that I need to resit. But I do not want to do it anymore. I wish they never put the idea in my head that I am smart. I do not feel smart. I feel like an idiot that cannot handle the real world. I am so exhausted from looking for internships. I am so tired from having to do a large project each semester along with having to learn for multiple huge tests.I cannot quit university now. That would kill my mother she is so worried about it. I can feel it in everything she does. So that is what I want to do. I want to at least finish university and then I will see what I do.I wish I could do my entire life over again knowing what I know now. Id do it all so differently. Id spend more time being active going outside moving learning new things learning how to deal with adversity Id find something I am passionate for or at least something I could enjoy doing as a peaceful job.I hope this rant is not against the rules or anything. I read them and it seems fine. Writing down my emotions and regrets like this makes it easier for me to process my emotions. But I do not know how long I can go without another emotional breakdown from my mounting anxiety. Either Way thanks for reading. Not sure if depressed but... Please hear me out. My negative emotional outbursts have been getting more common.,Depression
8887,I do not know what the point of this post is really. I am feeling okay not great but okay. Tired as hell though which is very usual for me unfortunately. I do want to die of course that has not changed. It ebbs and flows with whatever is happening in my life but that constant baseline of simply not wanting to exist is an absolute that will never stop. In any case I am just so lonely right about now. Out of the blue sometimes I find myself thinking about the girl I had a crush on for years rejecting me two years ago. Haha pathetic right? 23 years old and living the dream Just a rant,Depression

7326,Well I am about to start sophomore year of high school and everything should be coming up roses for me. Freshman year sucked with a depressive episode in the middle of it but that is in the past right?Well everything is great on the surface at least. I have a large circle of great friends an amazing and beautiful girlfriend I get good grades and have the chance to finally play school baseball this year. I am sure I seem happy and I feel like I should be but I am just not.I am an anxious fucking mess below the surface and honestly I think its starting to show. I am constantly paranoid that people secretly hate me for no reason. I am starting I have trouble sleeping again and my panic attacks are coming back. My last sibling at least left at home leaves for college in a few weeks school starts and I have not ever been into this building my anxiety is already building about baseball next spring.I do not want to go back to therapy and I really do not want to get diagnosed with anxiety because both my sisters are. Whenever I went to therapy I was terrified to stop playing the act of my regular confident self. Maybe I just have trust issues because I do not tell anyone about my issues not even my girlfriend or best friends. I hate it but I just cannot.I cannot do this again man. what is wrong with me? my life seems good!,Depression
8468,I recently scheduled myself to so stuff I will enjoy doing for tomorrow however it always gets pushed for tomorrow's tomorrow and then that day's tomorrow and so on.How do I... Not do that? Tomorrow is magical not in a good way,Depression
8215,I know it sounds silly...I have not watched that much anime only yugioh when I was a child nor have I played any anime games. Though I was playing that doodle champion island games thing on google and it was making me cry because... Idk it is all so lovely. I am fed up of trying to find hobbies the emptiness the loneliness trying to distract myself being endlessly haunted by how I feel experimenting with medications that make things worse no one understanding how I feel the near constant worryinganxiety questions over my identity and all that shit... nothing has worked for me and it hurts so much. All that 'help' from others and trying by myself has perhaps made me understand things better though I still struggle in a big way.Fuck I just want a talking octopus a ninja cat and blossom tree to hug me eat noodles with me then go longboarding or cycling through a lovely old lane. I often wish I could exist in a cute anime world where everyone and everything was all fluffy and cuddly,Depression
7871,it is not because I do not want my family to suffer. it is not because I want to live. it is because whenever I failed at something I was looking forward to I found out that some other rich kid had connections with the company' so of course they got the scholarship instead. that is the way life is. If there is anything I learned over the last few years is that nothing in this planet is that nothing is designed for your well being. People will fuck you the fuck up just for fun. So yeah I want to die really bad but I am not planning to just because I was not born with the privilege of having a better life. I am letting my parents have their moment so I will live against my will until I am dead. If reading horror stories dating chicks I barely know and binge drinking is what makes me happy then so be it. The reason I do not kill myself is because the system is corrupted to it is core,Depression
9082,I am sure we all are repeating the same daily routine and bad habits over and over. Life just do not hit the same as you grow older being forced to work a mentally and physically exhausting job just to survive. Either that or grind out of it which many few manage to actually achieve.I appreciate life and its potential alot but this just is not for me. I have wasted the most important years of my life tryna get it right only to no avail.I got lucky back in march with crypto and reached the highest highs and now I am experiencing the lowest lows. Cryptos the only way out of this rat race for me but i do not think i can wait years for its full potential. If it was not for Crypto i probably would of ended up killing myself back in March or April but idc about that now.Just tired of being so tired and sorry if it sounds like I am moaning but I am just tired of everything. Not having the energy or drive to break the cycle,Depression
8003,Seriously this book is amazing. I learned so much about depression that I never knew before. This book would have made my recovery ten times easier if I had read it back when I was really sick. Check out this book on Goodreads This Is Depression A Comprehensive Compassionate Guide for Anyone Who Wants to Understand Depression A fantastic book everyone should read,Depression
7849,I think I have been depressed for so long now I do not know any other way to be.Been fighting my depression for so long I am starting to think that depression is all I am capable of feeling.Anyone else experience this? Gotten used to being depressed.,Depression
8630,I wrote my suicide note the other night I have a plan as to how i am going to commit I am self harming. I cannot stop binge eatingpurging or starving myself. I want to quit my job. I am not sleeping. I feel numb alot of the time. I havnt showered or left the house in 4 days.But on the outside I just simply seem a bit low and more tired than usual and not like I am slipping away or how abysmall I feel . I slip into smiling laughing joking and chatting I am going to work hanging out with my dogs pretending I am doing my hobbies and doing things here and there around the house. I striaght up said I am not coping I have been binging all day and I want to die to wich I got 'yea sure'. I do not know how to get it across that I am drowning and I do not know how long I can keep treading water for. My mother is a paranoid schizophrenic and my death would likely push her into yet another psychotic break . My dad is her carer and has had to deal with alot of tragedy and hardship in his life and I cannot make him go through my suicide on top of all that but I am scared I am going to just do it one day on impulse or when the intrusive thoughts and reality of my life becomes too much.I cannot take down this mask I have of evrythings fine so everything that comes out of my mouth seems disengenutous or just as an off mark or dramatic comment. I know I am not going to kill myself tonight or tommorow but it is this constant itch in the back of my mind and never completely goes away. how do I express to my parents the severity of what I am going through and how depressed I actually am,Depression
7481,I am the only sibling who struggles a lot with mental health from what I know of. My sister has had her moments but she is never been constantly struggling and my brother is always positive. But I am the one who is depressed. I am the one who is anxious. I am the one who cannot make friends because it pains me to talk to people. I am the one who barely does anything but sit in my room and write and read. My parents have done a lot for me they always try to help with my mental health even if they do not understand it but I wonder sometimes if they are embarrassed of me. I wonder if my sister or my brother is embarrassed of me. I wonder if they all get tried of me asking about small stupid things because I am terrified about them. I wonder if they get tried of me looking so sad all the time or barely hanging out with anybody. I wonder if when someone asks about me my parents do not talk about me because who would want to talk about a depressed kid? Anytime I try to speak up and ask for some comfort on something I feel like my parents are just tired of me. Over the past year I have been getting better at being able to speak up when worried but it seems as if they are irritated and upset with me for asking for comfort so much over such stupid things. In my head they are big and suffering and keep me up at night but my parents always tell me that I cannot let those kind of things control me. I am trying. I am really trying. But sometimes I just need someone to tell me it is going to be okay you know? I am worried they all think of me as an embarrassment. I am worried they are getting tired of my questions and my worries. I am just worried that being like this makes me embarrassing. Am I something to be ashamed of? Should I be ashamed? Should I have the strength to work it out on my own? Am I an embarrassment?,Depression
8459,I know I am not alone but I seriously do not know what to do anymore. I will not be able live like this for much longer. Nothing brings me joy I have no hobbies and have no desire to pick new ones up. I have tried to force myself to do anything and I just get angry and frustrated. Even my last few safe hobbies are now boring. I do not want to go to the gym or read a book or go for a walk or write or draw. I am so mind numbingly bored that I feel like a caged animal. I sit in my room and scratch and rub at my skin hit head and legs roll around on my bed as if I am in agony. I feel like I am going insane and if this carries on I will go insane. I just want this to end but I do not even have the balls to kill myself. One minute I want to cry and the next I want to smash my head so hard against a wall that it fractures me skull. What the fuck do I even do now. I cannot do this anymore. Absolutely nothing brings me enjoyment anymore. I have no hobbies nor do I want to I begin scratching at myself and hitting myself and rolling around like I am possessed. I am so mind numbingly bored I am so bored I feel like a caged animal I just want to die. I cannot live like this.,Depression
7322,I am just trying to vibe but i get random urges to cut myself what is that about what is makes me want to cut myself?,Depression
8903,So many events in the past that should have no long lasting effect on me always pop out from nowhere. Just past traumas like screwing up my first semester for college or leaving some very close friends by resigning from a job to improve my grades in college. It hurts so bad and recently it has been worse than usual. I am really considering getting a prescription for antidepressants but I have heard that withdrawals are like 5x worse than the lowest low. I am taking psychology in college so I feel like I should have better control over my emotions but I am almost at my breaking point right now.I am in this depressive state where I just do not know what I am doing with my life and I have a need to compare myself to others worse off in some way just to make myself feel better which is an asshole thing to do but it is hard to help it sometimes. what are some coping strategies that I could use to not feel like piss every moment I am awake? Life is being held back by past traumas,Depression
7953,I am so tired of this nostalgia crap everywhere. I do not want to be reminded of what I went through in 2005 or the extreme bullying I endured. Or my suicide attempt. I just want to move on and live in the current day with present day things. But no life has other plans.I cannot escape my past when it is suddenly everywhere again. I feel like it is fate. I do not have any reason to live anyway. My life has been a waste nothing to show for it. Just wish things would stay out of the past I do not to be reminded of. Sorry for the waste of time. Seeing things from the worst times in my life return makes me fall deeper into depression.,Depression
8609,I do not even know where to start...18 year old the steep downhill started.. Broke up with my girl we were 4 years together failed my exams could not enter any university my father was unemployed for 10 years so here he comes knocking my door and saying you have to get your ass out there and work to pay the bills...

I am having serious thoughts of killing myself and the worst of it is that I want to kill others too what is going on to me how can I deal with this I feel like I am losing grip to reality what is this bullshit I cannot deal with this anymore... Life is bullshit,Depression
7882,I have always hated myself throught my 17 years being here. but i never really know if I am actually sad as fuck all the time or doing it for attention... hearing everyone talking about their past and traumas makes me feel like i honestly have no right to be suicidal and sad. I am honestly going crazy trying not to end it all here. all of my pillars of support are in different schools and i barely see them as much as i used to.. now i spend my days in my own school barely talking to anyone and leaving straightaway every time my teacher dismisses us. yea sure i have a boyfriend and i know that i can always talk to him but i still feel so alone. am i bad person? am i faking it..?,Depression

7687,Its taking a toll on our relationship and I do not know how to help. I do not deal with depression anxiety or any other mental health issues. It makes it really hard to relate. She does not want to seek professional help as she is said in the past that when she is gone before she never knows what to say. I want to help her get on the road to recovery but I do not know what to do. What are the best ways for me to be supportive of my wife dealing with anxiety and depression?,Depression
6972,Been stuck in a loop of ruminating overthinking. I still cannot seem to connect with another person I find attractive even though that is the least of my problems right now. Just overwhelmed with what is in front of me and trying to stay calm but imposter syndrome is ringing in my ears Low,Depression
8711,Is anybody else here plagued by constant stress related intrusive thoughts? They come from nowhere and always involuntarily. They seem to be related to stress since higher levels of stress make them worse for me. For me most of the times it is a fantasy i get stuck into. There are arguments with other people in my head feelings of anger and the stress that it produces. I could be going about doing my thing at home or at work and they will pop up from nowhere. The only time they seem to not be able to appear is when I am talking to someone.Does anyone else experience this? If so any tips for managing it?ampx200BFor those who do not know this is the wikiedia definition of intrusive thoughts''An intrusive thought is an unwelcome involuntary thought image or unpleasant idea that may become an obsession is upsetting or distressing and can feel difficult to manage or eliminate.'' Intrusive thoughts anyone?,Depression
8114,Its like we hit rock bottom and then went 10 levels lower than that. Everythings backwards nothing matters or makes sense. My mind is jumbled on a daily basis more than ever before. Maximum brain fog. Even staying away from the news social media etc does not make it much better. It was already tough enough personally before any of this. Truly hard to find any meaning in this world Anybody else feel like the world has lost its mind beyond belief?,Depression
8627,I would wish this on anyone its such a hard battle at times Depression is like being in an emotionally abusive relationship with your brain,Depression
7348,I have 21M been depressed for maybe over ten years. I have had my share of unhealty relationships and healty relationship that I have ended up ruining. Now I am dating this girl that i fell in love with at first sight and i have never loved someone like that and i have loved before. she is kind cute understanding patient openminded she is just perfect to me. Thing is i have a bad habit of sabotaging those relationships and now I am scared I will do it again.. I am trying really hard to communicate a whole lot and be the best boyfriend i can be but I am just so scared of myself.. i feel like i do not deserve her but i still want to be with her. I do not want to ruin this one cuz I will probably never find someone like her again and i just would not ever forgive myself. I am scared I will ruin my relationship with my gf,Depression
6968,My mom made me go to a camp that she knows I hate. Now I hate most days the only good time is at midnight where I can think to myself but I do not want to call CPS because she does small things but they build up and I do not want to be taken away from my dog. So does it get better? Does it get better,Depression
8819,TW Mention of self harm and attempts. My sister and I both suffer from severe depression and anxiety solely because of our alcoholic father. I have been suffering since I was 13 yrs old and I felt like I had recovered for the most part. My sister is 16 and has been suffering from depression for a few months now and it has progressively gotten worse. She was self harming and has attempted 3 times over the past few months. My father obviously does not care and my mom is very closeminded and does not know how to communicate with my sister. I had to drop out of school and quit my job so I could stay home full time to watch my sister and make sure she is safe. I have taken her to the hospital several times and she stayed in the mental health unit for a few months but it has not made a difference. she is back home and I am constantly on edge because I am worried she is going to somehow hurt herself. I try my best to keep an eye on her and I basically follow her everywhere around the house. Everytime my parents find out she managed to cut herself under my care or attempted they blamed me for being careless. I love my sister with all my heart. I am fucking exhausted and I can feel myself wanting to give in but I know I have to be strong for my sister. Am I an awful person for thinkingfeeling this way? I feel trapped and I do not know how to take care of myself and also take care of my sister simultaneously. I think my depression is coming back from looking after my suicidal sister.,Depression
8009,I go down this list and see so many ppl hating life. I do not get why its like that. I mean I feel the same way. So many people with depression,Depression

7222,I have been thinking about the two treatments today. I see similarities between both of them.Its almost as if you need to become a masochist and really want the pain in order to get better.Kind of explains why star athletes seek pain and why they succeed and why they often fall into depression after retirement.Guh. Try retiring after wasting your life as an accountant or salesman. Then you will really question the point of seeking pain disguised as therapy.Easier just to be catatonic. Behavioral Activation Therapy and Exposure Therapy,Depression
8629,It pains me that this has happened to me. Grandpa died with me when I was 9 years old and my father got cancer and he died when I was 13 years old. I am afraid that these two events have changed my brain structure permanently and I will always be prone to depression. I quit smoking and suddenly became severely depressed I had to go to a psychiatrist right away. It just hurts me that it happened to me I would like to look at the world positively but I cannot. I am only 20 years old after my dad died my grandmother promised me that nothing bad would happen to me but she was wrong. I do not want to fight depression most of my life. I wish I had a normal life like the rest of my family no one died in their childhood. It pains me that this has happened to me. It hurts me that my life would have been better if they had not died. My childhood was good but death destroyed it. Fate sucks. It hurts me that it is all because of the death of my father and grandfather in childhood.,Depression
8373,I am for sure adding clonidine next month after i fully get up to 100mg on lamictal but I am considering adding wellbutrin also. When i use things that are dopaminergic my mood goes right up to happy land but i feel like i already have too much norepinepherine causing intense anxiety so I am hoping the clonidine would keep that in check Have any of you all used Lamictal with Wellbutrin? And possibly clonidine,Depression
7975,Does anyone else feel like its to late to get good at anything. I am 18 going on 19 and feel like I have a 18 year hole in my life. Like I just started living. Every around me someone is good at something. It took me awhile to come to this thought but now its all I can think about. I cannot do anything without almost breaking down. Playing games and watching tv are the only things I am good at. I just cannot shake it. Putting myself down,Depression
8889,i feel like I am destined to end my own life. I am not going to anytime soon but i just feel like a few years down the line ill have to do it. I am so fucking irresponsible and childish that it only makes sense to check in early. maybe ill kms when I am in college so my roommate can get a 4.0. And i do not get the whole people will miss you shtick. None of that shit'll matter if I am too busy being dead to care. Destined to die young,Depression
8393,I have so much to live for. I have kind of supportive parents a comfortable life and a bright future ahead at least a career that will make me enough money to survive. Yet I feel so sad and down. I feel like I have no motivations or goals and I do not enjoy doing anything. I am constantly worrying about my future even though I feel like I will not be living long enough to see my future anyway. I use all my time to study instead of pursuing my hobbies because I am afraid that I will not be able to pass my professional certification exam.Even when I was in my happiest relationship I felt so alone at times and no friendship gave me any satisfaction. I just feel these bouts of sadness and I feel guilty for even feeling upset because I live such a blessed and fortunate life. Why am I depressed? What can I do to improve my mood? I feel so stuck and hopeless and all alone even though I do not want anybody around me. Please give me any suggestions.. I do not understand why I am depressed.,Depression
8712,I feel terrible so part of me thinks I need to refill it.The other part of me is wondering if life is actually worth it if I have to drug myself into submission to tolerate it. My prescription ran out and...,Depression
8853,Having one of those sleepless nights going down a rabbit hole of negative thoughts. Sometimes it is nice to be reminded that I am not the only one psychologically fucked up. So anyway what do some of you do to keep thoughts of self hatred at bay? At this point I hate pretty much everything about myself physically. I think my biggest problem is my level of perfectionism that I cannot shake. I know my negative qualities should not bother me as much as they do but I cannot help feeling the way that I do. How do you deal with self hatred?,Depression
8023,IWTL how to lose weight yesterday I posted this on the IWTL sub and today I took the peoples advice from the sub and started my weight loss journey. I did some exercises for today and after I was done I sat down with a healthy breakfast. As soon as I sat in front of the tv to eat my mom taunted me So you started exercising today? I said Yeah. She suddenly told all my family that Ime was not going to eat any butter or pasta or any junk food. I did not respond at all because I am used to her being that way and you cannot really reason with unreasonable people. Then she proceeded to say that she will order pasta and some noodles and was staring at my face. My mom has been my first bully and has never understood me and so has the rest of my family. I love the foods she mentioned and she knows that I am insecure about myself and I will have to resist myself a great deal if she orders that. My little sister 18 chimed in and added to all this. She said she would also order things for her to eat. All the junk food imaginable. And all of them waited to see how did I react. I did not react and pretended like this did not happen. This is a pattern now every time I try to improve they react very very negatively I feel like shit at my house. I do not know what to do. I started my self improvement and weight loss journey today and my family absolutely brought me down.,Depression
7592,So my parents have this thing where they will take a long time to let minor wrongdoings go. They hold all my small inconveniences over my head and it makes me feel awful. For example they started yelling at me for being ungrateful about the help they give me which is completely untrue by the way and when I started to fight back because I am done with just sitting down and taking it they hold it over my head for at least the rest of the day. It makes me feel like nothing I do is good enough for them. How do I deal with this? Whenever I try to talk to them about anything wrong that they do they always get angry about it. What do I do? Parent issues,Depression
8077,there is always been something wrong with me I did not learn quick enoughdid not pick up simple skills until years later than most people I am 27 years old and do not feel like a functioning adult at all I have to concentrate and stress just to complete simple tasks like a child walking around in a mature body I am married now and trying to support us but failingshe deserves so much better than me i know deep down I will continue to let us down. A life spent beating your head against a wall is no life at all I am terrified of dying but even more scared of living like this and even worse dragging the people I care about down with me. I just want people to know I REALLY triedI quit all the drugs and drinking and threw myself into menial jobs and took all the overtime I could getI did excersise and ate well tried to pick up hobbies even though I am useless with no skills I tried to make it work with this broken fucking brain but I am just not cut out for this world.what is wrong with me was wrong from the beginning and is wrong all the way through me . I am so tired and just want to let gothe burden of being a worthless deadweight is too much I know if I end it people I love will get hurt but surely I will hurt them more inadvertently blundering through life the way I am . I am defective,Depression
9027,unironically listening to Linkin Park atm. I listened to my fair share of edgy shit as a kidadolescent but I see now why they stood on top among all the edgy early 00s bands. and relating a bit hard to the lyrics haha. you ever kind of want to tell someone you are unironically relating to Linkin Park lyrics but you think they would laugh rather than understand? it is pretty grim I have to say. I feel pretty 2D.anyway I was pretty depressed already but this whole event has upped the difficulty an uncomfortable amount. dear God let me survive this fucking week. or do not I do not much care a ton at the moment. ghosted by my best friend. it is probably my fault but I will go to the grave wondering.,Depression

8638,The likelihood of this happening is near zero and I probably would not want any passengersthe pilot to die too but whenever I hear the zeeeee sound I think about what a blissful painless death it would be if it crashed to the ground onto me.

8069,Drowning in the pain of it all. Wondering how long before he moves on. Sad as fuck. I do not think my husband loves me anymore,Depression
8119,So to me that means that being depressed means I am pressed down I side myself because the environment is not safe for me. Sometimes small changes make the environment safe different dress behaving certain ways etc. But it is more interesting to me how I can change my environment by changing parts of me that I am ok with changing. I do not want to change parts of myself my personality values and characteristics. I like and respect these parts of me that remember reality and events and protect me. But I am willing to change parts of myself like the actions I take to connect with people. The actions I take to be more pushed our into the world environments where it is safe for me to be seen exactly as I truly am. The etymology of depression means to pushpress down,Depression
8316,Last year I went through some horrible interpersonal shit on top of the pandemic. This ended up triggering a massive bout of depression. I was suicidal from May 2020 to September which was a brief respite and then again from October until May. I was still horribly depressed in June but I did not want to kill myself. I got put on venlafaxine at the end of June and have been titrating up since. My mood has increased a noticeable amount and while I still feel depressed I think things are finally looking up. But for some reason it feels as though I do not want that or as if I should still be so deeply depressed that I want to die. Has anyone else experienced this? what is the deal? I do not understand why I am feeling this way. Why do I feel like I should be more depressed?,Depression
7547,I do not feel like I am getting enough attention and its making me depressed. I want to feel acknowledged and thought of. What should I do? I feel like I needwant more attention what should I do?,Depression
6962,I recently went through a breakup and she said she still wants to be friends so I said I can try doing that but when she talks to me about things it always hurts. I just want to lose feelings so all this pain can stop it hurts so much and I cannot even cry about it. I do not want to hurt her because she said she does not want to never speak to me again but I do not know what to do here. When we were together she always hurt me so I do not know why I still love her. I wish we never met it would be much less painful How do I lose feelings?,Depression
8330,I am just done. I have accepted that I do not exist. I do not care if other people care about me. I am just miserable. And I do not want to put in the effort to make change. I am too tired. I am tired of everything. I just want to sleep. there is no reason to go on when you do not even want to,Depression
7928,I never understand why people go out of their way to put me up on a pedestal. Both people I know and strangers online offer positive reinforcement and encourage me to be healthy and sometimes even go on to defend my actions. I cannot forgive myself and I do not deserve this kind of attention. I hate that I am ugly I hate that I say stupid shit I hate that I was the abuser and I hate that nobody sees me as a worthless unintentionally bigoted manipulator who does not deserve love in the slightest. Thoughts,Depression

51063,What should I do if I strongly suspect AvPD? I've struggled with mentalemotional problems pretty much all my life. Even as a young kid I was very shy and anxious. That morphed into more severe problems as I became a teenyoung adult.Now at almost 30 I'm really frustrated because nothing gets better for me. Doctors keep trying to treat me for depression or anxiety or ADHD which I do have problems with but it seems like there are more fundamental deeply set issues which go unaddressed. I've been interested in psychology since I was a teen and there have been times where I've considered that I might have AvPD before forgetting about it but recently I began researching this in earnest and pretty much every diagnostic criterion strongly fits me. It's kind of scary how well it describes me and how much the posts in this sub reflect my thoughts amp experiences.Where should I go from here? How can I bring this up with my psych or should I bring it up? Would getting a diagnosis be worth it?,Personality-disorder
51204,I Just Talked With My Boss... Yeah... let me tell you I might have nightmares about it.My job lets me book working hours at any point of night or day. So I naturally started booking weekends...Nobody comes on the weekends so I stopped preparing as much. This weekend I went to my job without washing my hear and with home clothes. I thought nobody is going to be there... why did I do that ahhhhhNot a long while after I arrived some of my collegues messages me that he wants me to work for 1530 minutes more that day because he left his laptop at a restaurant and he wants to get it back... and he's coming to the office in 30 minutes Welp they got usBut my collegue is not by boss right? Why does the title mention my boss then?After my collegue arrived my boss dropped in xd. He had a conversation with me about me working a little less past month 91h the limit at my company is 84. He asked me if I'm doing ok and all I was able to think in my head is he's checking if I'm not liability and it's one of the last straws soon I'm going to get fired. I acutally always feared being fired. The fact that I dropped out of uni and don't have a degree AND this job pays a lot and everyone here is very noncontrolling makes it much worse.I hate it when my mind just hyperfocuses on someone's face and picks up their micro expressions then concludes they have no respect for me.Of course all of this is projection... but relly it would be terrible if I lost this job. I have no qualification and I only got here because I was recommended they have a policy that they always hire.,Personality-disorder
51159,Failing to understand the true logic behind social interactions and relationships. Until I started reading about psychology and watching videos about it I don't think I understood myself or other people thoroughly.I wish I had done this 20 years ago.Because well school doesn't teach you this AND my parents didn't teach me this at all. They provided but they didn't truly parent me. They were mainly focused on their own emotional needs without knowing it.,Personality-disorder
51067,What to tell my therapist? I have a therapy session today and it basically determines my entire future. Im 19 and currently studying and my school is basically just for people in therapy. I couldnt imagine going to a normal school at this point. My therapist pretty much told me shed stop seeing me if I didnt show any improvement and I told her that my life would be over if that happened.I wasnt trying to be dramatic its just true. Not only would I be kicked out but I also wouldnt have a school to go to as I cant function in a regular school setting. I know very well that I havent shown any improvement since the last time we spoke and idk what to tell her when she asks me about it.Ive considered lying but Im pretty shit a it. Shes quite terrible but Its so difficult to switch therapists here that Idk what to do.,Personality-disorder
51334,Low EQ Parents I always knew that my dad was low EQ.But my biggest epiphany was realizing that even my mom is low EQ.You always think that because women tend to express their emotions so readily that they're high in EQ.BUT beware THAT IS NOT THE CASE.Emotional Expressiveness IS NOT THE SAME AS Emotional Intelligence!,Personality-disorder
51418,My first therapy appointment in a long time I have had bad luck with therapists in the past but decided to try again. I am mainly going to overcome a fear of driving.

Before in therapy I didn't have specific goals and I don't think that helped.,Personality-disorder

51371,Looking for an AVPD friend I would really like to have an AVPD friend to talk to when I really don't feel like putting on this stupid mask of pretending to be normal. I'm 23 years old looking for someone preferably around my age. Also I'm from Cali n Latino. Hopefully I can meet up n be irl friends? Shoot me a dm. I just think that if I can't find my place anywhere else I can find it here with y'all. I mean we understand exactly what it's like to be this way. So I just wanna say that I'll be accepting of u and I hope you will too. I just don't want to feel so alone.,Personality-disorder
50992,Thanks for being the community I never dreamt to have so yesterday I had a therapy session and the therapist asked why i think i have no friends.i answered i have interests that few share where i live as i live in a small city so it is hard to have friends or form relations based on interests. also i have no interest in sports and that is the common interest where i live i told him i am part of many online communities but i just lurk as i feel that i don't belong enough to participate in these communities even if they are based on my interestsat that moment i remembered reddit and this community and i felt that i already have a community where i can freely be who i am without fearWhen I joined reddit it was for something tech related then i said why not searching for avoidant and i was expecting nothing but to my surprise i found this sub and it was unbelievable as it is hard to find anything related to avoidanti was new to reddit and navigating it but i was happy as i found people like me.as i kept browsing i started to get related more and more to your posts. I felt a connection to you and i realized i am not alone anymore.Knowing i am not alone anymore is one of the greatest things anyone can ask for it meant i have People who can understand me and my struggle and what i am going through.People who can understand me and i can understand them.People with who i can share whatever i want knowing they will understand me and won't judge me in this communityi don't hesitate or feel shy to share anything with youfrom sharing memes to asking questions and seeking help and advicehere I share my problems and secrets that no one knows including my family.I finally found a home here and family this community really seems like an oasis in the desert I have more to say about this community but i want to keep this post short as possible.i feel blessed that i found you and being part of this community i just wish I could meet you or some of you in the real worldand to newcomers welcome abroad. in one way or another you aren't alone anymore.,Personality-disorder

I had a friend but I avoided him I have no one to invite.It's my birthday tomorrow and I'm feeling like doing some avoidant shit.,Personality-disorder
51545,Can denying my sexuality be a cause of AVPD? So few years back i got AVPD diagnosis. I am now trying to get out of this rut and fix things. Thing is i have avoided everything all my life even my feelings. So its hard.One thing i am thinking of past few days is that when i knew i was gay at 13 years old i avoided thinking about it and refusing to accept my sexuality. I only came out once i was 19. So 6 years i was 'locked' in avoiding being who i am. I am in my 30s now and after a bad breakup been trying to figure my life out.Is it possible that being ' in the closet' for more then 6 years contribute in developing AVPD? As i notice i still dont accept my sexuality 100 and still think what people might think of it and reject me because of my sexuality. Thats what i did when i first figured out i was gay thinking that my then friends would bully or reject me...Any other gay people here who can relate?,Personality-disorder
51221,constantly drawing a blankbrain fog i honestly feel like i've had a brain injury of some sort. in like 80 of conversations even with family members i simply have no idea what to say in a conversation. my mind is a complete blank even in what would be a pretty standard 'easy' conversation. it's like i'm paralysed or something. i either mumble something only to retract it or just say nothing at all. it's awful and it makes me not want to talk to people even more because i don't want to put them in an awkward uncomfortable situation and make them think even worse of me. i'm really pessimistic about ever making friendships or even mere acquaintances nowadays. i literally have nothing to say i feel so socially inept that i just don't bother anymore.it didn't used to be this way either. i was confident talkative i had friends who i'd talk with long into the night. even with people who weren't my friends i could still hold a pretty decent conversation. where did that go? it feels like that part of me just left one day i don't know why or even when it did. it just left.i'm usually pretty fine about this. i don't crave intimacy or friendship and am pretty content by myself. but sometimes it just hits me how screwed i am. a family member had surgery recently and i texted them to see how they were doing. that resulted in them trying to have a conversation what with them being on bedrest and all but my responses were so... bad. they seemed to think so too because they stopped replying haha. i can't blame them in the least for it too. i wish it wasn't this way but i don't think there's much i can do about it either. this blankness it feels like it'll be there forever. like some kind of inpenetrable fog muffling my thoughts blocking off any higher function.DAE experience this kind of thing? does it get better with time? how do you deal with it if at all?,Personality-disorder

50619,does anyone else hide their phone from everyone or turn off the television when someone else walks into the room? Not because they are doing something suspicious but because they don't want their preferences or choices to be seen? I have the option to watch YouTube on a smart TV but instead I watch it on a tiny little phone screen with earphones when I'm in company because I don't want anyone to see my web or streaming history even if it's something as innocuous as looking up a recipe or reading an online news article. I just feel so much fear of someone looking at my internet history although it's generally harmless and boring crap.I remember being 10 years old and my brother being angry at me because I would turn off the TV and act all shifty when he walked into the room.When I was a child I would hide my drawings from my parents and classmates because I would be so embarrassed. That was my first sign of AVPD.I was eventually diagnosed at 21 and again by another psychologist at 27.,Personality-disorder
50813,I'm in CRISIS because how AvPD can potentially influence my desicion for a new major I left college because I wasn't passionate about what I studied and because how much stress I felt of not being socially competent to fulfill a social focused related major.And I'm here again I don't have much time too choose a major and to go back to college my parents have told me this is my last opportunity and limit time but I'm not sure if they would actually follow this through. I don't think they would but I could be wrong. All my interests and passions are related to social things social justice oppressed populations people's potential. I have a big desire to help people and I'm interested in social causes and. On my very top are things like social work sociology and lawBut I'm very afraid of the challenging aspects of my personality and how contrary are to the abilities I need to have for these fields. I don't want to be an incompetent professional because of my characteristics and disorder. I'm extremely afraid of having to leave college again or not being able to succeed.And I know that there are different ways to work in these fields. not necesarilly having the most direct contact with people. But I want to have direct contact too. I had an experience in my previous major where I interviewed a person in treatment process after they finished their sentence. And I felt so passionate while doing it and I liked so much interviewing him analyzing their protective and risk factors to later make a treatment plan closest experience to social workI also worry that if I go to therapy and solve these issues maybe I will end up realizing that I can't stand naturally and in a healthy way working for long periods of time with peopleWhy is that I'm not naturally inclined or interested to paths with way less focus on people TT,Personality-disorder
51391,How much of your avpd surrounds your appearance? I've been told I'm pretty but I almost never believe it lol. I don't like attention of any kind good or bad. I noticed that I have this weird perfectionism that I have to look good for people. Ofc you want to be presentableBut I take it overboard. I won't leave my house if I feel too badly about my appearance that day. I feel like I'm offending people by not looking good. I'm pretty sure this stems from ofc childhood. I didn't care too much for looks as a kid I just wanted to have fun. But my dad would constantly judge my hair want me to change my clothes so I can look better. Every thing was about appearances with him. He would constantly look at himself even in windows while walking out in public.He'd spend hours getting dressed despite having no hair so I don't get what took so long . I noticed I've picked up the same habits. I care far too much for my appearance when logically I know most people don't care. And if they do care that's kind of weird. Are you like this? How does your appearance play into your avpd?,Personality-disorder
50874,Narcissistic mom uses family pet as a weapon I don't live with my her anymore so she has less power but she likes to use my bond with the family dog as a weapon. My vulnerable narcisstic brother over 30yo ''pretends'' not to like the dog he doesn't actually hurt the dog but he pretends not to like it and the dog can sense it and feels confused. He moves between this and making a joke about it in front of others to cover himself that it is just purely an act. For example i know he will have some pictures taken with the dog showing that he likes the dog so if anything were to happen he would play victim. yet he will keep them hiddenMy nmon knows my brother does this out of insecurity towards me and she plays to it when I speak to her on the phone she will bring my brother into the conversation even when I was not talking about him she pretends to mishear that id asked him a question just so he can say something like''' im just busy punching the dog' then my nmom gleefully says back to me he says he's says he is punching the dog and she does this to make sure I say something back so they get the reaction their looking for even though she knows I can hear perfectly well what he said. I dont take the bait but says something to move the conversation along like'' sounds pretty lame''.They do this routine all the time in different ways and my nbrother has even started a new one where he jokes about getting ready for his fight with me and my nmon plays to this aswell encouraging the imaginary conflict and trying to bait me into saying something back that escalates the situation. Of course again if anything were too happen I would be blamed regardless of the outcome cause it's all just a joke after all. Making vague threats of violence and beng lowkey mean to the dog.My nmon has done this in the past with her ex bf she would vaguely threaten me with him and she would encourage them to ''step up'' and argue with me when they didn't really want too. That led to a fight one time with her bf confronted my youngest brother and cornered him in the bathroom He came out crying and said he got punched which led me to react and a fight. my bro lied he was just scared. I ended up getting arrested and blamed for the whole situation the bf holds deep grudge against me because the trauma so I have to avoid certain family gatherings where he is there. Even though my nmom orchestrates the whole thing.Just wanted someone to share this with as its quite depressing,Personality-disorder
51180,AvPD or just selfish? Im trying to understand if its because my partner is selfish or its because of AvPD. Will take and take and take and ask for more and state I dont do anything. Will never do nice gestures for me such as offer to pick me up drop me off take me to lunch. Be affectionate. Anything really. Treat me like a doormat. Cancel plans on me last minute prioritize commitments with random people disregard my feelingsthoughts. Were moving in and our place is going to be used as a business place with clients sitting in the living room all day and evening. Never take any responsibility always contort discussions criticisms and play victim. I understand a lot of AvPD behaviors are rooted in shame and self doubt but I dont see how that applies to the above behaviors.I would describe her as a high functioning AvPD. Ive read some posts from similar people and by her own words she feels like she is wearing a mask around other people all the time. Also seems shes used to using and disregarding partnersmen. Her life long friend called her out on this.EDITI needed some clarity and validation! I do not think this is AvPD which is why I had to ask. Also was looking for experiences from those in similar situations with mine or those with AvPD.Thank you for the replies especially the detailed one from uCulturalAbrocoma83,Personality-disorder
51551,Devastated after finding out my little sister has a secret boyfriend Not sure if this belongs here but I'm so upset about this that I haven't slept all night. My sister is my only friend. I feel like she understands me more than anyone else. I'm completely relaxed and comfortable around her I can just be myself without overthinking what I look like and how I come across. She's basically the only person who is able to make me laugh. I've always been open with her about my thoughts interests and even my mental health struggles. I know it's not healthy to expect one person to be my entire social life but I literally don't have anyone else I can talk to about anything. Yesterday I found out that she's been lying to me by saying she's meeting up with friends from school and sleeping over at her bff's apartment when in fact she has a rich foreigner boyfriend and she's been staying over at his place. He's also been driving her on trips to nearby cities. I knew this day would come my little sister had to grow up someday and get a boyfriend but I wasn't prepared to feel so alone abandoned and betrayed. She never mentioned that guy to me and my father I'm disappointed that I had to find out about him from my mother. I still haven't talked to her since I found out about her relationship but I can't fathom why she would hide it from me when I've always told her everything. Of course I want her to be happy but now all I'm left to do is wait for her to get married move to a different country and forget about me leaving me to rot and die miserable and alone.,Personality-disorder
51480,My mom has Avoidant and dependent personality disorder and I don't know what to do. My mom is a very caring and emotional person and she's never been mean or rude in any way. However she never believes me when I say that to her. She's struggling with loving herself and believes that no one loves her and can help her. And because of that she has resorted to drinking. Because of her disorders she constantly bullies herself every day on everything she does and thinks she's the worst person alive. She's very sensitive too so one little thing can ruin her day and cause her to drink. My parents are separated but theyre both on good terms and still talk. On top of that Im struggling with myself too and I think Im stressing her out. I'm only 14 so what can I do to help her? She tried many antidepressants and other treatments but said that none works. Compliments doesnt work either since she never believes me.I always worry she's going to do something bad to herself one day.,Personality-disorder

Or when you become a regular at a new place and other regulars start remembering you and you're no longer '' new''?Me too. I did not know it was an AvPD thing before finding this sub. The worst part is i want to socialise and i want to not care what others think of what i e' joy. But i care. It feels like once others find out that i'm a real person they start to expect me to behave like whoever they perceive me to be.

I don't even know if this is a right sub for me to post on because I don't have any diagnosis but I feel I can relate to most things described here. I'm 23 years old and basically I feel like a defective human specimen. I'm scared of everything every task or opportunity seems impossible to achieve. Even when I'm writing this I can almost feel physical pain. I can't communicate with people and feel inferior to basically everyone and unworthy of anything. The feeling of powerlessness and inability to change this is unbearable. I don't know why I decided to write all of this and what to expect but here it is.Wishing a good day for anyone that might somehow read this post.,Personality-disorder
50790,Resentment towards attractive people I'm sure I'm not alone with this problem but I've been feeling this way for so long I don't even understand how healthy people avoid these feelings.Let's say an attractive girl posts hot pictures on social media. I believe it's natural that this sort of content sparks great desire in any guy. I think it's also safe to say that 90 of guys will never have a chance with a girl like that. So I'd say it should be normal for these guys to feel some resentment unfulfillment jealousy sadness selfdoubt etc.This isn't however what I'm observing in reality. Generally these kind of content on social media receives countless upvotes and praise from guys.Can someone explain where is my reasoning flawed?,Personality-disorder
50635,Im worried Im second choice I met a guy on a trip two years ago. He told mutual friends that he liked me and he asked them not to tell me but they did. When he found out that I knew he cut off all contact with me. Two months later he and his girlfriend broke up. I have to admit that before he was single I'd look at his TikToks a lot. I never liked or commented on it I'd just watch the videos.A few days before he and his girlfriend broke up I noticed that my TikToks would go up. I had 3 followers but whenever I'd watch his videos a few hours later my TikTok views would rise. I even tried doing it on certain days eg. I'd watch his videos one day watch it two days later then the day after and each time I saw them my views went up and on the days that I didn't watch them they stayed the same. This continued for the better part of a year. Last year it was still frequent but less so. Now it's every two or three weeks that we do this. One time he even posted a TikTok in English English isn't his first language and all of his previous videos were in his native language.TikTok wasn't the only platform he was looking at me on. He would do it on Twitter too. One time I retweeted a picture of a Star Wars character. Less than an hour later he posted a meme of that same character. The meme was in English and it's not that I want to say that the meme wasn't funny but it was obvious that he posted it just to post it. There's been at least three other instances where he did something similar.However twice he did things that tickled me funny. About six months after they broke up he started following her on TikTok but unfollowed her within a few hours probably because she didnt follow him back. A month later one of his ex's close friends posted a TikTok video with his ex in it. He started following this friend. Around eight months of this going on he made his Instagram and TikTok private. I have no idea why. But I can tell he still looks at my TikTok because TikTok tells who looks at your profile. I dont post much and he looks at it every two to three days.,Personality-disorder

50589,Being a toxic person to others and wishing they didnt have to deal w you because of it I completely shut off due to my anxiety and depression. Its hard to not avoid avoid avoid and feel like a burden especially when you have people you love and know care about you. My heart and mind conflict so much because Im so sensitive and Ive just built a wall after years of negative feelings and rejections but my heart wants the exact opposite. And I get so lonely dealing with depression alone wondering why do I have to deal with this all the time but it hurts the most to be going through it and hurt the people you really love like I dont want to be a burden anymore but its easy to feed the demons that are telling you to avoid avoid avoid and the fear.

50668,AvPD can be avoiding woman only? I wonder if avoiding woman can be AvPD? I have avoided woman almost my whole life at some point in high school I liked a girl I talked to a bit. But never full got to know her because of paranoia of not having a car or being able to provide for her in any way. Its probably the only time I spoke with a girl. Mainly because I was invested in wanting to be with he but was to afraid to be with her in a relationship.If AvPD is not only avoiding woman for my instance then I dont understand AvPD.,Personality-disorder

51426,Does avpd stem from childhood trauma? Hi lovely community! Im quite new on this forum! And just wondered if the origin of this is similar to what people refer to as an avoidant attachment style in which a lot of sources claim its due to neglect from parents in early childhood.What triggers avpd or what is the kind of trauma that sparks it? From what Ive read so far its not something you are born with but rather develops with age?Please correct me if Im wrong!,Personality-disorder
51025,Childhood I just found this group recently and it got me thinking. I feel like I was always this way but it doesn't make sense to me that someone would simply be born this way. One of my first memories was standing behind my parents and somebody asked them What is wrong with him? To which they responded Oh he is just shy.In the first grade during story time I would face against the wall 2 feet away from everybody and just daydream. Never joining in but according to my mom my teacher found it cute so she never said anything.I found it embarrassing at the age of 7 when someone would call their parents mommy and daddy. I would sit with the kids that bullied me during lunchtime because I desperately wanted them to accept me. Up until high school I would constantly go to the nurses office trying to act sick so I could leave and at the very least be able to laydown for sometime.From middleschool to highschool I found my way to kinda fit in which was through humor gained a lot of attention but I only felt like I had 2 real friends this entire time. Even though id spend countless nights crying thinking those friends really hated meAny girl I liked in highschool I would never pursue because I didnt think I deserved them. Im sure everyone here did this though.Since the focus is on childhood im going to stop here but I just find it interesting how for me it seems I was always like this. How is it that in early development someone can be so selfconscious?,Personality-disorder
51434,How can I function with unwanted thoughts that don't go away? I am 22 years old and male. I was diagnosed when I was 18. I've also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I live with my parents and I am NEET. I did not go to college. I've spent the majority of my childhood and adolescence getting some kind of therapy andor psychiatric help but I stopped about a year ago because I realized it was not going to help me. I have very low energy and fleeting motivation and day to day I can't consistently do the basic tasks of caring for myself and maintaining my living space in other words living like an actual adult. The main reason these things are so hard for me is that when I'm doing chores and things where my mind can wander I keep thinking about things I don't want to think about. I remember in detail the moments when people have insulted me or been cruel to me or times when I've embarassed myself or made a mistake for years and I relive them constantly and the wounds are continuously reopened and never heal. I often freeze up when these thoughts strike me and sometimes it makes me curse or say things out loud when I know I'm alone. Sometimes these thoughts can be powerful enough to ruin a good mood and ruin my day. It can make completing simple tasks so painful that I avoid them entirely and my quality of life suffers greatly and it affects the people that I live with. I spend almost all of my time constantly trying to distract myself and escape from these thoughts. Can anyone relate? How can I function like this?,Personality-disorder
50958,Two days ago I tried to kill myself Has anyone here attempted suicide or seriously harmed themselves. Two days ago I lacerated my wrist with a knife and had to go to the ER and get stitches. I nearly severed an artery luckily I will make a full recovery but I feel a deep sense of regret and shame that I did this. I don't want to get into too much detail but it happened in front of my family. I also tried to to choke myself with a piece of clothing and physically assaulted my family as they were trying to stop me from hurting myself. I feel most guilty over this as I am normally a very passive person but I let my own emotions take over and didn't stop to think of their wellbeing. I do not come from an abusive family at all they love me which is the reason why im not on the streets right now. I have been in a really bad mindstate for years now due to isolating myself but this was all my fault and obviously i need to take responsibility for my own actions. I have a deep sense of rage underneath myself which i try my best to mask. Most people who post here seem like good people but i feel like i'm not. I'm terrified I might be a covert narcissist.,Personality-disorder
51192,So i just went on a date... I'm M28 up to this point i have had next to zero experience with dating or women in general. I started chatting again with this girl that i had ghosted after asking her out on another app almost exactly a year ago. I was surprised that she would match with me again this time i decided to go trough with it though. What helped i think is that she is of a pretty similar personality type as me not a big time texter and sometimes slow to respond etc..I decided to be just totally honest when we met i told her I'm not the most exciting guy and that I'm pretty boring honestly but i said it with kind of a smile and a good attitude. We ended up holding hands walking trough the city and i kissed her on the way to my car and again when i dropped her off. It felt like there might be some hope after all. She asked me what we should do next time and i had no answer because i hadn't even considered it could ever come to that. ampx200BI just had to tell someone. I'm not trying to brag. If anything its an example that even if your feel inadequate and unworthy like i do often its mostly on the inside. I've told myself noone will ever like me this is simply untrue and if you feel this way its most likely untrue for you too.,Personality-disorder

51281,Contemplating So I've noticed that when I contemplate my inevitable death I feel strange. I can think about if I die tomorrow the next day or amy other time but when I remind myself that it is virtually impossible for me to live past say 120ish it feels different.I think about how nothing I do will ever prevent me from dying and really it is the only time I feel so...human. I feel small and frankly insignificant because nothing I ever do will amount to anything in the face of eternity. A hundred years after I die what should I care? I'd be dead so whatever I do will only matter to others if it even reaches that far. Besides by that point whatever hopes I had that my actions benefited someone is dead alongside me. What I'm getting at is I'm nothing more than a collection of matter that gets some pointless shot at doing something for myself and the other matter blobs around me. It feels very human to me that feeling of nigh nothingness. That is why I'd consider myself religious because it's the voice inside that tells me something as pointless as me is seen and cared about and that the things that I do will matter for the rest of eternity. I know it sounds crazy and people have told me repeatedly that I'm stupid for believing in anything but what else do I have? I've gotten as close to the edge as I could before just to see if I would do it. Clearly I didn't but if I didn't have some hope that my faith is worth it well you know. Anyways what I'm getting at is that I'm religious because it makes me feel wanted like I have a purpose even if it's not entirely clear to me or anyone else really. I hope y'all have good coping mechanisms too because I can take a good guess at what my life would look like if I didn't have my faith.And for those of you who were hurt in some way because of someone's religion I'm truly sorry that you had to go through that. Nobody should have to experience that. And I hope you don't think any less of me for my faith I wouldn't try to hurt someone just because they disagree with me and I don't get to choose how you live your life.At the end of the day I do sincerely hope y'all are doing okay. ,Personality-disorder

51373,Avoidance confusion Anyone else have to think about if theyre avoidingpushing away someone because they genuinely dont like that person or just because commitment is scary? I moved in with a friend and surprise surprise it didnt go well. But also there were a lot of things they did that really upset. And when I expressed my feelings they used my mental health against me despite the fact that I never really talked about it with them in the first place. This is just one example of someone who I wonder if it was my mental healthavoidance issues or if I genuinely didnt want to be around them because of the layers of things they did that upset me while living together that made me see who they truly were as a person. Or am I just coming up with excuses?,Personality-disorder
51397,I wanted to be different. So when I was younger I knew perfectly well that my family had issues the only thing was that I thought that it was normal. I looked at my parent's divorce how poor my parents both were my mother's constant struggles with drugs mental health jobs and relationships and figured that there were more kids at school who's parents also divorced so what makes mine any different? I kept going through life made basically no friends and in the fifth grade I moved parents. I switched from living with my mother to living with my father. It was strange as both parents had very different parenting styles. My mother was more uninvolved due to her relationships mental health and other issues. On the other hand my father is very authoritarian and often wasn't home as he spent his entire day at his office. I don't want to keep going on about the messes that happened in my life because I feel like I'm just complaining at this point. I just wish my family cared more. It's strange to think that after all the signs I showed my family did nothing. They didn't stop and think something was wrong because they were so focused on everything else. And after everything I did to try and help my family members too it's like they never considered that I was hurting too. When my brother's depression led him to be hospitalized why would nobody think that hurt me?Or when my dad lost his grandfather and he couldn't hold himself together? I comforted him while my brother though given his condition I don't blame him remained distant.There's plenty more too much that I did that someone else should have done. Children shouldn't have to be adults because their parents are too busy or naive to do it themselves. I know I'm not giving much detail given some of the things I've mentioned so I'm sorry for that I'm just not ready to share those things yet. I want nothing more than to leave my relatives behind and never look back because all I can remember is how they failed me and how I actually believed that they were good people until someone finally got close enough to me to see how bad my life was. I still can't believe someone had to tell me these weren't normal and that I did have bad parents. I grew up not knowing that these bad things were actually bad. I thought it was normal and maybe to some degree they are normal but definitely not all of it. Because I thought how I felt was normal and because when I did try to speak up I was invalidated by those relatives who had also gone through something.Just because I could hide my pain better than them didn't mean they were hurting worse than I was but it sure made them feel that way. I wanted so badly to be different than everyone else because of this. I saw people who were hurting who thought that I was normal so I didn't want to end up like them. If what I was was normal then I promised myself I would watch the mistakes my relatives made and not copy them. I would be someone different someone people would like because I had it all togetherunder control. But I didn't I was just hiding. I wanted so badly to be someone special because maybe then I would feel wanted or accepted. And now because of that it hurts me deeply when people say my condition is normal. I just can't bring myself to believe that this is normal that everyone feels like this. It makes me feel so weak and pathetic. That's why I hid because if I did try to show people that I was hurting then they would just brush me off and invalidate me again. I wanted to be special and now to some degree I guess I am but I don't even know if I want to be. Without this condition why would anyone care about me? But with this condition it wouldn't matter if they did anyway I'll have so much trouble just trying to accept that someone actually wants to be near me for some reason.Of everything that I want I want just a few things.I want to move far away from my family and never see them again so I don't have to be reminded of my past. I want to be a better person who's past doesn't define them that way I can be myself and be okay around other people. And lastly if I can get those other two things then I want to be in a relationship with nice woman someone who will support me and understand that I'm not always going to be okay but I'll still try my best to support her. Of course there's more to a relationship than that but having someone who can be empathetic with me is definitely something I'm looking for. Well that's it for now. I want to apologize for this being so long and uncoordinated. I hope this doesn't make anyone feel bad I know there's a bunch of negative things in this and I'm sorry about that.I really hope y'all are doing well. ,Personality-disorder
51300,Do you guys try to avoid people you know or just people you don't know? I used to be anxious about being around strangers but now I don't really care as much. But I always get way more anxious at the thought of meeting people I do know and I try to avoid them as much as I can.I don't even see any value in forming friendshipsrelationships anymore. I try open up as little as possible to people. The more I get to know them the more I try to avoid them.I fear that friendships come with unrealistic expectations and that as people get to know me they'll realise that I'm weird and will gradually dislike me and maybe try to make me feel guilty for not meeting their expectations. I also don't want to become dependent on other people cos it seems like most 'friends' only seem to care about you when it suits them. I just think most friendships are fake and overrated.,Personality-disorder

And leaving all these things up to time and opportunity was just another way to avoid being held accountable for my lack of action. And now Im here and now I have to deal with it. And thats all itll ever be. I hate that I control my life. I dont want to. I just want to leave. Or stop. I just want everything to slow down.

50926,Where did my AvPD come from? So I am officially diagnosed with it but most people on the internet and also my therapist say that it is likely because of a childhood of abusivenarcissistic or in any other way bad parents that resulted in this condition. But I dont think that it comes from that. I couldnt have had better parents or family they supported me respected my opinion and so on. I have the feeling that I always was like that even in kindergarten back then. The only thing odd about my parents was that they divorced as I was 6 years old but I guess thats not the most uncommon thing and that my father is also very socially avoidant. Could it also be the latter like in a learned behavior? or do you think it is more likely that it was something in the past that I just forgot and dont remember dont think is significant enough?Often I ironically feel a bit isolated when I see comments on YouTube or Reddit talking about the reason for the AvPD because I cant relate at all to their stories thankfully tho but you know what I mean,Personality-disorder

I like Reddit for the simple fact that there are communities here for just about everything that I don't have access to otherwise. I also use Facebook groups but I have an account with a fake name and no information on the profile. If I have commented too much in a single group and people start recognizing me I usually change my name on Facebook. You are usually allowed to change your name on Facebook several times a year or so.I just hate the fact that I am seen and I have built a persona either online or offline. I just wish I could be invisible or anonymous everywhere I went including online. I also hate people knowing what country I was born in because most people are from the United states and it makes me stand out so I try and use American terms and spellings as much as I can. I also have trauma from my home country and just mentioning that I am from there makes me anxious and I feel paranoid talking to people from my own country.

51543,just turned to my coworker and talked one day i've always been in awe of people who can just start talking. every time i think 'i could say this!' it's immediately dogpiled with other thoughts. the self hating ones. i don't have it in me to list them right now but if you're reading this unfortunately you probably know what i mean. anyway. i was heading out for my break on saturday and i got my marlboros out of my locker. smoking is bad i know. i bought them off a friend of a friend who stocked up on her trip to italy. so i turned to my coworker notoriously one of if not the most outgoing in our little crew and said hey check these out. and i showed him the picture of the blackened lung on the carton and we kind of joked about how fucked up it is that those kinds of health warnings are the norm in other countries but not here USA. i don't really know what was different this time. it must have been a beneficial glitch because i haven't shown that degree of spontaneity since especially not while 100 sober. it was nothing. and the self hating thoughts came right after. but once those settled a bit it was nice. thanks so much for reading i just wanted to ramble as always.,Personality-disorder

As a kid I blamed myself and turned inward. As an adult if I fall for an insincere invite for connection or help I feel humiliated and angry with them and myself. I realize this has made me extra sensitive and I even expect to be rejected. It is extremely hard now to ask for help. When someone burns me I dont think I will ever trust them againhard stop.

I genuinely had no idea that I was smiling but that would explain why people are usually cheerful around me! Apparently this is referred to as fawning.,Personality-disorder
50701,Anyone scarred by 1 period in their life? For me it was High School. Just forgetting it and realizing that I will not carry those people along with me for the rest of my life has been such a boon.Those were just a random assemblage of people thrown at me. Nothing less nothing more.They don't matter to me anymore.,Personality-disorder
51253,I made my feelings known despite knowing I wasn't going to get the results I wanted. I told someone how I truly felt about them. I knew I wasn't going to get the results I wanted but their reply was sweet and gentle and did not come across as complete rejection. I walked away from the conversation in no more pain than I was in when I started it. I can at least live knowing that I didn't let my anxiety keep my from taking the chance. I don't think anything will change between us as a result of the conversation which is good as they are a good friend of mine and I would hate to lose that.Life has been weird lately I have discussed my feelings about this person with someone else which is something I wouldn't have ever thought I could do. I think that has helped me gather the strength to talk to the other person directly. Whatever works right?,Personality-disorder
50709,I just realised I don't seem to make friends Soooo...I'm 44 years old. I have a group of about 15 friends in my home town in another state to where I live but 14 of them I did not make. ALL of those 14 were made by my best friend back in school who I befriended at age 14 who is quite outgoing. And then we just had this friendship group which started at 4 and then eventually grew and I count them all as my friends but I never actually made any of them myself.I made not a single friend in university. I made 2 friends at my first job when I was 22 but we never saw each other outside the workplace and I haven't heard from them in 20 years since I left there.I made 2 friends at a subsequent workplace when I was about 30 but one kind of kept trying to be my friend SO insistently that eventually I gave in and she was fun and nice but I haven't seen her for over 10 years. The other one I realised later was my Favourite Person FP BPD lingo and that is the only reason I was interested enough to want to get to know her and want her to get to know me. I had a platonic crush on her. Even so after 2 years my interest fizzled and I haven't heard from her since also about 10 years ago.Then when I was 40 I made a friend here in my building she lives in my home town most of the year but has a place here too and she became my Favourite Person which again is why I let her in and we became close. Again my feelings of attraction fizzled after about 2 years and we're still friends but I hardly see her as she doesn't live here most of the time.So I feel like my friends are all mainly made via my original friend who I made at age 14. And now 30 years later...I still don't really have any friends and haven't really made any.Is that weird?,Personality-disorder

51303,I wish I could be assigned a friend or partner so I had someone to share my life with Mostly I wish I could just skip all the scary beginning stuff of getting to know someone. I like having friends but Im terrified of trying to make new ones. I like socializing but only when its not terrifying. Ive never been in a relationship but it seems nice to have someone to be there for you at the end of the day. I only have my family but they all have their own lives and their own immediate families. I just wish that I had someone outside of my family. I wish I had someone that liked similar things and that I could go do stuff with or someone to eat dinner with most days. I just wish I wasnt so scared of trying to get the things that I want. It feels like a pity party kind of night. ,Personality-disorder
50864,I am so damn scared of my therapist I heard avoidants are reluctant to seek therapy...Well in 2021 I had a very hard time struggling with my mental health I have ocd. I scheduled therapy 3 times with 3 different therapists and unscheduled it before every appointment because I couldn't gather the courage to go I could not stand the fear of being judged and exposing my vulnerability like that I felt so ashamed I wanted to vanish.Anyway... currently I am on meds for my ocd because I finally managed to go to a psychiatrist. However I don't wanna be on meds forever so I started therapy too.It has been 3 sessions so far and I am seriously considering leaving. Although I see how this can be helpful I cannot stand the shame it brings me to talk about myself like that. It doesn't matter how many times the therapist says he won't judge me and understands me. My brain tells me that is absolutely impossible.To make it worse I cried last time on therapy because I was talking about some very personal struggles. This made me even more ashamed.The therapist lives near my house and as fucked up as that sounds I am so scared to walk near the place where he lives and cross him on the street it happened once..... yesterday I was there and felt as if I was gonna faint not exaggerating. The shame is unbelievable.My next session is on Friday... today is Wednesday... oh dear God I can't believe I am paying to feel like this. I can't even tell if his approach is the problem or if it is just my avoidance. Honestly I think I'd feel like this with any therapist.,Personality-disorder

51546,I just need to vent about my partner. I think my partner has bpd maybe AvPDHi everyone. I have no idea how to start this. Im honestly not even sure if bpd or AvPD is correct Im just grasping at straws at this point. My 27f boyfriend 28ms brother has been diagnosed with bpd. Which is why this is my first step. And while Im obviously not looking for someone to diagnose him like this Im just lost. And need someone to listen. I am massively struggling in my relationship and I just need someone to listen. Even if this goes nowhere. My boyfriend asks for a lot of things for himself but is very hypocritical if I were to ask the same in return. We just had a long talk so my brain is sort of foggy on details and I cant quite think of an example of that at the moment he does ask for things in one moment and when I do them or stick to it he tells me its wrong. Example he has wanted to get a photo ID for a while. We have two options drivers licence or a photo card. About a month or probably two ago he said he needed photo ID for a test at work hed been putting off. Then he said not long ago that we dont motivate each other to do the things we need to. I know he has anxiety planning things and doesnt want to so for our anniversary I said pick which ID you want Ill drive you there pay for it and itll be done. Ill put all the planning into it. All good and he loved that idea. The day we were supposed to go he was angry about something and it caused an argument. So we didnt go. Which got pushed off to the next week and the week after. To today. Each week he said Ill do it next week on my day off so I asked and he pushed it again. Today we spoke about it and while hes not good at planning I was waiting around to find out if we were going or not as I wanted to plan when I was done work and went to get gas and groceries. When it was about 2 hours before we had to leave if we were going for him to take the drivers test I told him that I didnt care if we went but if he wanted to study more now was the time. He told me tonight that he only did it so ID shut up about it and when I said you told me you wanted more motivation so I gave it to you he just said fair. But we always have those moments where he says he wants something and I change to do it but then he gets pissy about it. If I try and talk to him about my needs or what Im wanting more of or how Im hurt by something he tells me that he just wants to be left alone and that he never asked me for anything. Or hell just give me all the things about himself that suck or how he feels and completely disregards what I was even talking about. If we have an argument for 1 full hour lets say. There will be lulls in the argument. Maybe every 15 minutes. Maybe start half hour mark and then end. It always changes but the lull is when he sits listens and answers me with respect. The other times its that I have said even one word to set him off and hes miserable. And angry and not nice. Im finding myself constantly working around his moods. Sort of judging if now is a good time to even show him a TikTok or something I find interesting. If he agrees with what Im showing him all is good. If he doesnt he gets angry. Says hes confused and basically shuts down. Tells me he thinks thats dumb or why would someone even do that. Theyre not part of my life. Why do I even need to listen to that. If Im talking about my work or just complaining hell tell me why he doesnt want to hear it. That its not part of his world so it doesnt matter. Ive asked him certain things to stop or change and whenever I do hell tell me something he needs in return. He cant just take blame for things. Sometimes he can. But normally cant. I definitely do not help the situation because I am at his every beck and call and hes at none of mine. If he asks to be left alone and I walk to another room he says he feels guilty that Im going away. And that hell just sit and stew and feel bad and then he doesnt get his way anyway. He wants to be left alone a lot. Cant ever take anything I say and listen. Always has to tell me why whatever Im going through is something hed love to have or how his life is worse. Example we moved for his work. Away from my family and friends and my best friend dropped me. While she was being shitty all the time she was the last person I had to talk to. And if Im sad about it he tells me thats his dream for people to leave him alone and he doesnt understand why Im upset. If something small happens he wildly blows it out of proportion. Especially if its something he doesnt understand. I have to be careful with how I joke with him because he will take everything to heart but has zero problem disrespecting me or poking fun at me for something. If we go out at all he doesnt want to be there and will usually get extremely high or drunk to avoid socializing because it makes him anxious. Im just not sure if this is like anything anyone has dealt with and Im looking for advice or help or just something. Thank you for reading this long novel. I really appreciate you all.,Personality-disorder

I actually managed to hold it down for a couple months even lol. Heck in a few instances I even was kind of good at it. But eventually I cracked and quit. I could only get ignored or misgendered so many times. Now Im back at square one. I know I can push myself but my endurance seems so fickle. Although I do have some confidence.

51097,Entitled People I had a guy cut in front of me and another woman at the self checkout line today. It made me feel ashamed as if I seemed weak or pathetic or maybe just a woman and thats why he felt entitled to just do that as if he was sure I wouldnt say anything. And I didnt because I guess I didnt feel angry enough to care. Anyone else experience shit like this? Wondering if youre sending Im a doormat vibes. Because in reality I avoid relationships because Im strong enough to know Id never want to be walked all over but too guilty to get into relationships that are really about my desires and boundaries. If that makes sense. I avoid because I know Im too scared to own who I am but Im unwilling to be with other people and be codependent. So Im alone. Stuck needing to figure out having the strength to let myself find the people that genuinely meet my needs.The funny thing about this though is that when my time came to checkout i still got out of the self checkout faster than him even though we had the same amount of stuff,Personality-disorder
51079,I wish they made a film centred around an avoidant character Ive struggled to find any kind of media where the protagonist specifically struggles with avoidance. I really enjoyed Amelie and resonated a lot with the character but feel that she could more easily be seen as struggling with ASD or even just extreme shyness introversion. I dont know about anyone else but seeing characters I identify with in films or in novels brings me a lot of comfort. It kind of brings awareness to those traits and humanises people and has the ability to shift the audiences perspective on those issues. Maybe if we had more coverage in the mainstream we wouldnt feel as defective or alien.Id love seeing an avoidant main character and having people really understand how severe this disorder can be and how overlooked it is. It could be painful and raw showing how damaging isolation can be yet how there appears to be no alternative. But it could also have light moments and laughoutloud moments and show how people suffering with this disorder have light inside them despite everything. I also think its important that the character be shown to be relatively attractive intelligent good work ethic etc. I think a large part and maybe the most tragic of this PD is that we view ourselves as less than we are. Almost like we have conditioned ourselves to not value anything about us even if that value is present. I think people should see how the issue is deep rooted and its not as simple as improving things like wealth appearance or even social skills. Im curious what other people think would be important to include in a film centred on a character with AvPDAlso this song would definitely make an appearance imohttpsyoutu.bewDLA5ZFQLbs,Personality-disorder

51346,Selfdiagnosis for this what do you think? Obviously I think therapy is extremely important this but I also think it's one of those things that can be selfdiagnosed. With the age of the internet it's easy to get into the mode of selfdiagnosis whether it be for physical or mental illness. But I feel emotionally struck by this it's not a fun thing or something that feels relatable it strikes me to the core and I don't want it to. I don't want this to be the reality but it resonates so much more than social anxiety disorder ever did. I'm not saying that a feeling is an indicator of the truth but I've read a lot about it and continuously have tried to think of ways in which I may not but it fits so well. Beyond on the symptoms I've dung into the roots the commo thought patterns behaviors etc. It's not something I feel will pull me down or become a selffulfilling prophecy because as painful as it's been to learn about it's something I feel refreshed by in having language to explain my experiences and perception of myself. I thought I was self aware before but I had a lot of false beliefs and I also have a tendency to detach from my unhealthy and hurtful behaviors.,Personality-disorder
51438,How common is this for people with AvPD? Sorry I'll try to keep it relatively short.I'm a 31yearold male and I've never been diagnosed with AvPD but while reading about the symptoms a month ago things finally made sense to me why I act a certain way. I thought I just had some kind of social anxiety when I went to therapy several years ago but I've felt that there has to be something else since I started feeling different in middle school. I've avoided people responsibilites and have taken jobs where I can mostly avoid interpersonal communication. I do still have close friends a great family and a girlfriend but I still have this urge to selfisolate and be alone. However I do try to help people whenever asked and I try to do well at my workplace. Right now I have an opportunity to work longer at my current job and might even get a promotion 13 years along the line in a position that I could basically hold for the rest of my working life. But it would surely involve a lot more responsibilites speaking another language I don't know too well I live in a bilingual country where I speak the minority language a lot more and of course a ton more interpersonal communication. I've searched and applied for other jobs recently because my current contract will expire in a few months. I'm much more inclined to take a temp job for 1 and a half year with something I like more and less interpersonal communication than a potential permanent job position. It probably sounds crazy for most people if they heard this but this is genuinely how I feel. I let my feelings of inadequacy and wanting to avoid people control me instead of doing something that could secure my future. Is this at all relatable?,Personality-disorder

50995,Update to 'Oh god I have a date' My old posthttpswww.reddit.comrAvPDcommentszwc806ohgodihaveadateHi everyone!Since you all were so kind I wanted to share my experience. The date went okay but she kind of felt distant to me afterwards shorter answers not really engaging in text chats. It felt like she had no interest so I stopped texting her. Last Wednesday after a dance class some people went to a bar in the same building. I chatted with her and some other people. It was quite nice. Afterwards we had the same way home so we walked together and kept talking. She talked about some mental health problems she had and how she was dealing with it therapy and so on. She was quite open and frank. Later when I was at home I thought about how she was in person compared to the text messages. My picture of her had changed a bit. Previously I would have said she was quite the confident woman I still think she is though but afterwards I saw that she also had internal struggles and insecurities. So I today decided to ask her again if she'd like to meet for a coffee. She texted me back that she thinks I'm really sweet and it's always fun talking with me but her life is too full right now and she has no place right now for another friendship or something deeper. She'd like to keep it at the dance lessons and socials. She is sorry that's probably not the answer I was hoping for but she is just trying to being honest. I wrote back that it wasn't the answer I hoped for but I thought I would get. I thought she was a great person and find her to be pretty awesome so I had to write her. So that's it. I'm a bit sad now although I knew this would be coming. Still it's better to be in the clear. I've given up some hope to find a partner. It's so hard not to be frustrated or be frustrated live through the frustration and get out of it on top. My few relationships began during those very rare moments in my life where I was truly happy. A condition that feels unreachable at the moment. This makes it feel impossible to find love. I try to be the best person I can be but it never feels enough.,Personality-disorder

However last year and a half i've felt like my symptoms have changed a lot though i still have all the BPD symptoms some symptoms like avoidance social anxiety isolation feeling less came up from nowhere. For matter of fact i stopped talking to all my friends stopped working going out date i stopped living. This winter i didn't go out of my appartement and if it wasn't for my mother i would probably have died of hunger. Going out doesn't scare me people outside does. I feel like they all stare at me and they know how shitty i am i feel like i'm not like them and whatever i do i'm not enough. Even open the shutters is a damn burden. Sometimes i think i might be paranoid but i don't think people wan't me any harm nor i feel persecuted i'm just ashamed of myself...

50762,What is wrong with me I am in a relationship that I have wanted out of for the last idk how long. I cant break up with him. I have three times and every time weve gotten back together within 24 hours. I love him and I keep getting back with him but I just dont want to be with him anymore. Ive already posted about this here before since that post I did take everyones advice and break up with him but I didnt block him on everything and we ended up getting back together literally the next day. Why am I like this? What is wrong with me?We have had a messy relationship to say the least and despite how its not as messy anymore I just dont want to be with him. But I love him so much when Im with him I dont actually want to leave him. I know if I break up with him I will regret it eventually. I know if I break up with him again it will break his heart. When were talking everything is fine we rarely fight anymore and he does everything he can to resolve issues now because I know hes scared Im going to break up with him again. That makes me feel bad and also want to stay with him. Its a cycle of this. I just cant be real with him I cant be normal with him I cant be honest with him.

50779,Church made it worse I've been telling my therapist that I've wanted to go to church for a while. The last time I went was last Easter. So today I pushed myself to go with God's help but I didn't really enjoy it. I felt selfconscious during worship. I couldn't get outside my own head. When the service was over I just left while most people stayed to mingle. Being around a lot of people makes it worse. Most people go to church in families. Not all. But I couldn't walk up to another person who came alone out of fear. Then I went to the park which was another mistake. Seeing all the children and couples enjoying themselves was too much. No one goes alone to the park on Sundays. So I tried not to isolate but it was too painful and now I want to isolate again. I'm so useless.,Personality-disorder

There's times when I think that maybe the best thing I could do is to accept myself as I'm and that I should just give up on trying to change things.,Personality-disorder
51530,does anyone else keep making new Reddit accounts? I find myself abandoning Reddit accounts and making new ones every few weeks or so. I hate the fact that Reddit leaves a trail of evidence about me that I can't hide from people and make my comments and questions private. I hate the whole karma and upvotesdownvotes thing. I like Reddit for the simple fact that there are communities here for just about everything that I don't have access to otherwise. I also use Facebook groups but I have an account with a fake name and no information on the profile. If I have commented too much in a single group and people start recognizing me I usually change my name on Facebook. You are usually allowed to change your name on Facebook several times a year or so.I just hate the fact that I am seen and I have built a persona either online or offline. I just wish I could be invisible or anonymous everywhere I went including online. I also hate people knowing what country I was born in because most people are from the United states and it makes me stand out so I try and use American terms and spellings as much as I can. I also have trauma from my home country and just mentioning that I am from there makes me anxious and I feel paranoid talking to people from my own country. I go back and edit comments constantly and I'm always deleting things.People automatically find this behavior shifty and I have been called out a few times and people always think I'm up to something.,Personality-disorder

If I left he and no one else would remember me anyways. But I honestly dont want to be forgotten. It hurts.Ive never spent time with people in my childhood. I was the weird gay kid the f word. The one that gets picked last in PE class and has always been shorter and weaker than other guys. We once visited my cousins when I was very young. My father got along so much better with my cousins who are all more boyish than I was. I was quiet and boring. My mother told me her dreamwas to be a grandmother. Why else would anyone want a child? She definitely didnt win in the lottery because Im as gay as they come. I almost never spend time with my family I was too young to remember my actual first holiday. It has always been just myroom and I. How am I not supposed to be hurt that the only people I enjoy talking to are people I will never spend time with outside of their job? It feels so unfair. I wish I could end it all sometimes but I dont want anyone to find my corpse probably traumatizing them. Once again Im probably only doing this because deep down I want pity. But this is my only emotional outlet right now.,Personality-disorder
50797,So.. what now? How do I continue my life. I very recently got diagnosed 4 days ago with AvPD after years and years and years of thinking that I just have very stubborn type of social phobiasocial anxiety. I met with a specialist who really dug through my health records and diagnoses and even read through the psycological evaluation tests I went through over an year ago several times. She was very firm and sure that I indeed have this disorder instead of the one I've been getting treatment on and it all stems from me hard schoollife I had to go through. But instead my home life was always good very loving and caring parents and I love them so so much. They made sure me and my brother always had food clean clothes and a warm home to live in we were poor but still happy.My self esteem and self worth got destroyed from very young age by other kids it's also very hard to trust people I'm worthless and like a ghost to others at times. Without digging deeper to the trauma I've faced in school I've just been existing and surviving from the young age to the 30's. I'm 33 still very broken unemployed depressed too but I go to therapy and have medication. I've medicated myself with alcohol earlier years but stopped when I started antidepressants I still do self harm too as a coping mechanism which I'm not proud at all. I very much hate and regret that I ever started dabbling to that habit in my young days. Is there really something good about this personality disorder? Can I ever learn to live with it in the way it won't make me isolate myself from others and fear other people? I don't know. I have a lot of doubts even when I am in a treatment and path to somekind of recovery. Is it even possible to meet new people and form a romantic relationship too? Yes I'm single been for the last 10 years and sometimes it's eating me from the inside to the point I feel physical pain. I crave human touch nonsexual and sexual and sometimes I'm at the point that even a single friendly hug would make me cry. Yes I am lonely. Luckily I have a small friend group very small and two closest people out of this group are a couple so naturally they don't always have time for friends. Which I naturally understand they have their own things and struggles too. It's just life. When I told two other friends about this new diagnosis I got they do know about my mental health struggles well... they just were very silent and one of them answered with 23 words in the way of oh I see and that's all. It did kinda hurt does that make me a badattention seeking person? For wanting even just a little bit of undersanding what's causing me to behave some way I don't always even realise I'm doing it?Heck this is kinda one messy message but I just have so many things going in my head now and I don't have any answers to give for myself. I've always wanted to solve problems by myself but this is just too big of a thing for my brain to fully understand. And I almost deleted this text and didn't want to post. I'm sorry if I sound all whiny I just have so many questions and I'm sure there could be even more of them. I'm not even sure if the flair is correct.,Personality-disorder
50671,I despise my mom 22m Pretty much the title I just can't stand her I never liked her ever since I was a little kid but for me that hate went much higher beyond it.Just to clarify I don't think she is the abusive type more like the overcontrolling and overbearing type of mom the type that when you make a mistake or fail to do as she asks even if it's just the order of the way I put things in their place she will scold and do it herself even if those are MY things she isn't satisfied with the way I put my clothes in my wardrobe or when I don't do it immediately and barely have any respect to my privacy In the past she wouldn't even let me close my own door so my room was always open even this days she complain when I don't leave a gap but on that case I don't give a fuck anymore and barely leaves any not a door you can close easily and she would always complain about im not normal or like 'the other kidspeople' because I don't act or do things they do and I cant forget her 'what you gonna do with your life play on the computer all day? ' speech which she does when she remembers she needs to get mad or moody for no reason.Im afraid of embarrassing myself in public im afraid of even doing some of the basic stuff because I don't think I can do it or I'll make a clown out of myself and it always comes back to how I was never really taught how to control my own life and be independent even in the few times she did taught me anything she would still eventually take control and it doesn't make me motivated to even try. one of the reasons I eat in my room is because I just don't want to be around her because I will always get criticized for something my beard which no one taught me how to do it and my dad lives abroad my ears my hair my clothes everything. She always tries to pick things for me to wear and while today i do wear whatever I want regardless of her opinionpicks I still remember that when I was younger she would be upset and mad if I didn't wear what she wanted me to wear and she still kinda give the bitch look but as I said I still wear what I wear and the judgement doesn't stop at that. Her favorite habit is that on events and gatherings she would always whisper in my ear what's wrong me in the moment could be anything from noticing something dirty or not to her eyes that no gives a fuck about the way I behave WhY YoU ARe NoT SmiLing and all other type of shit to make me lose confidence or be overly aware of my problems. She would always try to buy me stuff I don't want or asked to get and would always expect me to thank her even if sometimes she was the one that was pressuring me to get something.When I think about all of this and other stuff I understand why im so incompetent afraid of making mistakes or embarrassing myself and stuck in that avoident and depressive mind set. It's not all her there are things I probably could've done myself and still can do and even without her the competitive and soulless society most of us are part of just adds a lot to the way we end up and still she has a part in why my life fucking sucks and now I need to find a way to get back on track somehow.Also today I pretty much snapped at her in an unrelated case which eventually also happened because of all those feelings I stored inside. I don't talk to her and tbh it's such a good feeling.P.S if there was another post made by me that's titled the same blame my stupid phone for this XD. Im also sorry for possible grammar mistakes don't mind someone fixin them.,Personality-disorder
50781,I don't make decisions or have preferences? I don't know if this is AvPD but It's like I can't make decisions for myself based on what I want or even if someone needs me to do something I constantly ask for reassurance I'm doing it correctly. If I don't feel totally confident I'll just sit there and wait till I can ask.I unironically use dice rolling and stuff to make decisions for me so I can kind of appear neutral always almost like a scapegoat? So if people don't like It I can just say I didn't really make the choice.I just feel so terrified of making the wrong choice all the time. Sorry if wrong place or if i put it badly but this has really affected me as far back as I can remember.,Personality-disorder
